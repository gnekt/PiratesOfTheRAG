Patient: Dear doctorI have taken x-Ray (pa view).Impression:-focal added density in left suprahilar region? Enlarged lymph node.-prominent bronchovascular markings in bilateral mid and lower zones?Atypical pneumonia.Pl advise what is the remedy for this.  Doctor: Hello dear, thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. Your x-ray report suggestive of densities in left suprahilar region. This can be due to 1. Enlarged mediastinal lymphnodes2. Infection (pneumonia). To rule out this, better to get done CENT thorax. If mediastinal lymph nodes are enlarged then you need endoscopic biopsy of the lymph nodes for the diagnosis. But if it is Infection then get done sputum culture and sensitivity to isolate the causative organism and starting of appropriate antibiotics. So consult pulmonologist and discuss all these. First diagnose yourself and then start appropriate treatment.

Patient: Yes! My mom is 67 years old history of hypothyroid x20 years in September 2014 she became hyperthyroid, change in medication she noticed a change in her handwriting 1 week later loss of right thumb 1 week later right wrist drop digits 2,3, 4 start to appear clawed hyper reflexes right upper extremity all the above changes seemed to happen quickly over 3 weeks thyroid meds are supposively balanced she has seen a neurologist, orthopedist & now wait to have an MRI of her brain MRI C-spine clear  Doctor: Hello. I have been through your question and understand your concern. It seems a progressive neurologic deficit. It might be temporary and the situation turning back normal.

Patient: My 11 month old has had a round lump on the back of her head on one side in the middle since birth.  The doctor said this would probably go away as the skull shaped but it is still there.  her ears and everything are normally positioned and she is starting to crawl and is very normal in every way.  What is the round lump?  it isnt huge, just different than the othe  Doctor: Thanks for the quarry. The back of head lump which is hard is due to protruded cockpit. This some time suture line fusion site. Other cases can be a small occipital lymph node. Advise is just ignore it when the baby will grow this will disappear with time due skull molding and reshaping. Or you can use occipital soft ring or pillow for shaping occipital round shape.
Patient: my chest x-ray says that i have an unfolded aorta. i am 47 years old and in good health. i did a chest x-ray because i was getting mild pains in the left side of my chest that have lasted for about 3 weeks now.  what does an unfolded aorta mean, and is it serious.  Doctor: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Unfolded aorta is an anatomical variation of thoracic aorta. Normally thoracic aorta arising Fromm heart, going upwards and right side between two pulmonary veins and turn around left pulmonary vein and goes down. But in some individuals, instead of going towards right side, thoracic aorta goes straight up or left sided and then comes down. This is known as unfolding of aorta. It is not a disease. It is anatomical variation which is present due to developmental defect. Furthermore, it does not cause any symptoms. So it is not serious problem. So unfolding aorta is not a cause for your chest pain. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.
Patient: I am a Tonsil (SSC) Cancer survivor and have CT scans now annually. I have CT done for neck and chest. This year there were findings in the chest that were not found in my last scan 1 year ago This was the findings and can you give me an idea of what do they mean ? Thank You FINDINGS: No mediastinal, hilar, or axillary adenopathy is identified.Coronary artery calcifications are present. There is minimal bilateral gynecomastia. No pleural or pericardial effusion is identified. No discrete pulmonary nodule is identified. There is a tiny amount of linear opacity in the posterior right lower lobe, suggesting atelectasis or fibrosis  Doctor: Hello, based on the information you provided your CT scan shows that there are no enlarged lymph nodes in your thoracic and axillary regions. It means that there are no CT signs of lymph node or lung metastases . The CT scan shows probably fibrosis of a lung segment due to previous pulmonary disease (like pneumonia). As a conclusion this is a normal CT scan. Congrats !

Patient: I went to my dentist as I was having the symptoms of the gum disease but they have just told me to how to brush my teeth. few weeks gone by I went to a different dentist as i was sill feeling the discomfort and on one tooth the gum is red but theyve also said the same thing but i know there is something really wrong with my teeth or gum but the dentist wont do nothing for me and i dont know what to do?  Doctor: Hello, Thank you for consulting with Chat Doctor. Actually in gum disease you feel bleeding from gums while brushing, with redness of gums.

Patient: Is albendazole a prescription only drug or can you get it over the counter by asking the pharmacy? I have had pinworms for about a month now and have taken mebendazole plenty of times during this span of infection, with seemingly absolutely no difference in symptoms.  It actually seems to be getting worse..  Doctor: Thanks for posting your question on Chat Doctor! Mebendazole or Granted palate are the most efficacious treatment for pin worm infestations. They are given as a single dose and repeated in 2 weeks to kill any newly ingested eggs. Since the eggs can survive for up to 20 days, they might be found in bedding and clothing it is even possible to spread the eggs in the air and swallow them directly. Once eaten, the eggs hatch in the intestine and develop into adult worms within 2 to 6 weeks Since the eggs can be easily spread, everyone in the household must be treated with the medication. Reinfection is still common because live eggs continue to be excreted in feces for up to a week after the treatment Wash your hands frequently, especially after going to the toilet, after scratching, and before eating, and keep your fingernails short to reduce the chance of picking up pin worm eggs. I hope if you take all these precautions' pin worm infestation will be treated successfully.
Patient: i have a picc line in for about a week and in that time i have had pain in my arm, shoulder and chest that has slowly gotten worse, i cant raise my arm up very high without pain either... it is also hot and my best friend thinks my arm also looks a little swollen. Is this normal? should i be concerned?  Doctor: Hello, As I was reading your history it misses a lot of things like why it was inserted? Since when it is inserted? Are you diabetic or do you have any high blood pressure? Any chest infection etc.? To come into a history conclusion I feel one should be able to differentiate between edema and wasting of muscles. As the upper limb is not moving much there might be wasting of muscles. Also, swelling can be caused due to poor venous return and using a stocking for it should be of choice initially and some simple exercise for upper limb should avoid swelling to persist longer. Besides, will recommend you get it checked by a physician as edema in upper limb over the left side mostly which isn't mentioned in the history needs to taken with attention without wasting time as heart may get involved. Please feel free to mention detailed history, so we can look out for a conclusion in precision. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.  Jay In Chat Doctor.
Patient: My 17 yr old daughter had a lumbar puncture performed over a year ago. The doctor that performed procedure was a resident doctor ( I think that s what you call it when they are first starting out) and she tried for along time unsuccessfully to complete procedure before the doctor had to step in and finish procedure. Every since the day she left the hospital she has experienced severe back pain. She has been told that she has deteriorating disk, arthritis and two cysts (all in the same exact area that she had the lb). She had been threw extensive physical therapy, injections and several medications. Today she was referred to more physical therapy and pain management doctor. Is there any possibility that the lb lead to any of these problems or severe pain that she has had since she was released from hospital. It has changed her entire life and attitude and we are desperate for resolution  Doctor: Hello, No lumbar puncture is not known to cause disc degeneration, arthritis or cysts, all these are age related degenerative changes. Usual complications of lumbar puncture are headache, infection or in some cases fibrosis and adhesions of the spinal canal. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care

Patient: I have cirrosis of the liver with aceites, (fairly high volume acietes). I also have a genetic disease which leaves me with too much iron in my blood. I am considering a transplant. however is seems that it is basically a life sentence of handfuls of pills, weekly doctors visits, and basically NO LIFE! In addition I have thought of the TIPS procedure, which I am finding out in 20% of the procedures leaves me with Encephalopathy! I am at a loss as to how to procede!  Doctor: Hello, You can probably have hemochromatosis induced liver cirrhosis.  It is an irreversible condition and cannot revert.  So liver transplantation or TIPS is the only option left.  Kindly attach your reports so that I can check it.  The side effects don't develop in every patient and some patients can cope well liver transplantation.  Hope I have answered your query.

Patient: Hello. Thank you for taking my request. I have just been given the results of my CT scan that my NEW General Practice Doctor ordered because I had radiating pain in my lower left quadrant. The CT revealed thickening of the Mesentery. My doctor recommended I wait 3 months and then get another CT scan. I ve had blood tests prior to this that rule out cancer but I am a breast cancer survivor from 3 years ago. Do I have legitimate concerns that say I shouldn t wait 3 months to get a surgical biopsy done? Thank you.  Doctor: Greetings. Breast cancer can recur in abdomen and since you are a survivor and recently having pain and CT shoes thickened mesentery, I will advise you to undergo a biopsy to rule out recurrence. It may or may not be cancer and should not cause undue worry. Regards
Patient: I had an angiogram yesterday and was diagnosed with chronic blockage of the right coronary artery . The interventional cardiologist stated approx. 64 cm. of the bottom of the artery was completely blocked. He stated that a by-pass was to risky and he would not consider a by-pass as an option. Can you explain to me the seriousness of this type of blockage?  Doctor: What you describe is chronic total occlusion of mid to distal RCA, two important branches PDA (posterior descending artery) and Pl (poster lateral) arises from it.  They supply Inferior and posterior wall of heart and some part of the septum.  The best part of such lesions are that good collateral s From the left side of the heart provides enough blood to these areas to prevent any kind of damage to heart muscle. Now why bypass in not a good option?  The distal vessels and small caliber vessels so putting a graft there in more probability the grafts will get closed in small while, and we are to square one. Options : get a thallium, if the area is well perfused, only medical management to optimize the heart condition and prevent further damage. If their Id ischemia in the region of supply, try opening it up by angioplasty, the results of which can only be told after opening up the block and seeing the condition of distal vessel However as I said there are good collateral in such cases and medical treatment is optimum for most cases Regards Chat Doctor.

Patient: My mother 57 years old has had smelly white cheesy filled bumps on her back most of her life.  I popped them last night for her tons of this yucky stuff came out and now she is very cold and has shortness of breath do you think the infection coming out could make her physically sick?  Doctor: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Yes, severe infection (sepsis) is more likely cause for her symptoms. She might be having gluteal abscess. And the stuff you are talking about it pus only. Pus is liquefaction of tissue due to local infection which is uncontrolled. This severe form of infection can also spread to blood. This is known as sepsis. Sepsis is the most common cause fir hypotension (septic shock). And this hypotension causes shortness breath, cold clammy skin. So your mother is mostly having sepsis. Better to consult doctor and start antibiotics and surgical debridement of pus. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your mother. Thanks.
Patient: Hi, I went to the Urgent care walk in clinic due to frequent palpatations. I have been dealing with palps for quite some time and only seem to be more noticeable after strenuous workouts. Slight chest discomfort, a little short of breath but not much. I take 25 mg atenelol, 10 mg Lisinopril for my blood pressure. As I mentioned before the last 10 days I ve had frequent palps which is unlike anything ive had before. I recently started a new job, seperated from a 7 year relationship and have been under a lot of stress. The EKG this morning read abnormal but the doctor said it was nothing to worry about. EKG readsSinus bradycardia, Anterolater ST elevation-possible early repolarization. Borderline ECG Vent rate 56 bpm RR interval: 1066ms PR interval: 148ms QRS Duration: 98ms QT Interval: 412ms QTc Interval: 405ms QT Dispersion: 58ms P-R-T AXIS: 55 84 22 degree I am a 29 year old male, in shape, don t smoke and eat pretty healthy. Just looking for second opinion thoughts..... Thanks.  Doctor: Hi, For your narration it is clear that you are a 29-year male with hypertension (high BP problem) on atenolol and lisinopril and in a mental stress. You have to attend clinic urgently for your palpitations. I want to know whether the EKG changes mentioned are during episode of palpitations or you have returned to normal before taking EKG.Also, your EKG changes suggestive of sinus bradycardia which is most likely due to use of atenolol and there is ST elevation possible early repolarization in anterolateral leads. You should not neglect these changes, there is rare but definite possibility of heart attack with your symptoms of palpitation, chest discomfort and EKG changes. What you should do is-1) Visit cardiologist.2) 2DEcho (echocardiography) needs to be done to know structural damage to heart like regional wall motion abnormalities these may be present after heart attack, enlargement of heart chambers like left ventricular hypertrophy or hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy which is also a rare chance in your case.3) Continue your medicines for high BP.4) If problem of palpitation recurs try to attend emergency clinic during episode only and get EKG done which can give much more information if it is not possible then undergo Holders monitoring & Electrophysiologist study of heart.

So I know I am not getting the protein out of what I eat. Oh by the way I am on Creon to help with the digestion.  Doctor: As a Urologist and kidney transplant surgeon, i understand your anxiety. In people on dialysis, protein intake is restricted to 40gm/day. If your body weight is more, depending on B.P.and electrolytes, it may go up. Its best decided, in consultation with your nephrologist. The omitting may be, due to increase in creatinine, electrolyte imbalance or even insulin deficiency. The insulin dosage will need to be adjusted. Creon is pancreatic enzymes supplement, given with caution in renal failure. Your nephrologist may ask to stop it. You may send doubts to me directly.

The causes of pain in abdomen in a child are as follows:The most probable cause of pain in a child -Tummy tonsils-meaning enlargement of the lymph nodes of the abdomen.-Appendicitis- by default this has to be ruled out in every case of pain in -abdomen of a child.-Worms. The best diagnosis is a high resolution ultrasonography. Some blood, urine and stool tests.

Patient: I have severe pain in my right arm from my neck to my pinky. my pinky twitches from time to time and my whole hand starts to swell. the pain is mainly in my elbow and down the backside of my forearm but it hurts all over. im going to a dr Tuesday but I was wondering if you could prepare me for what they might say  Doctor: Hello, I have studied your case. Due to compression of cervical nerve root there can be pain in your fingers.Also, there can be large disc bulge which can be compressing over spinal cord. For these symptoms analgesic and neurotrophic medication like pregabalin can be started consulting your doctor. Till time, avoid lifting weights. You can consult physiotherapist for help. Physiotherapy like Tens and inferential therapy may give you relief for few days. In case of nerve compression leading to finger weakness you need to decompress nerve surgically. If nerve compression becomes symptomatically severe then surgical decompression will give permanent relief. I will advise you MRI cervical spine and EMG-NCV [nerve conduction study]. Hope this answers your query. If you have additional questions or follow-up queries then please do not hesitate in writing to us. I will be happy to answer your queries. Wishing you good health.

She is sipping on warm water as much as she can stand to try and stay hydrated, but she appears very dehydrates, she is very weak, not jaundiced but a ashen look almost.

She was never officially diagnosed by a physician, but its certain the cancer has metatisized through her body, her eyes have been progressively sinking back into her skull and look very small, light bothers her very much, this has been going for several years now. She is considering seeing a rheumatologist. I think its to late for her. What can she expect at this point, is there any chance these new symptoms can be reversed? Thank You.

Patient: I have been suffering from electric shocks or stabs in my lower right thigh (inner). This has been happening for 10 years. There is no apparent trigger. I get between one and four severe stabs each day. They only last a second, like a light switch going on and then off again. I ve seen so many doctors, including neurologists. Nobody knows what s causing the problem. I had back urgery 5 years go. I still have stenosis in my lower lumbar , but this nerve problem is not attributable to my back ...... in my humble opinion. Could it be a vitamin B-12 deficiency? I m 65 years old and this problem is destroying my retirement. Thanks for any help.  Doctor: Hi, Thank you for posting your query. I have noted your symptoms. These are likely to be due to compressed nerve in the skin (cutaneous nerves), somewhat similar to neuralgia parenthetical. It is not a serious problem. You can take pregabalin or gabapentin capsules for symptom relief. Vitamin B12 deficiency could aggravate this condition, but not a cause for this. I hope my answer helps.

Patient: In 1989, at the age of thirteen I had a fusion at L4 L5 to correct a spina bifida occulta . I have done great with little pain until the last year or so. Two years ago I was diagnosed with Rheumatoid arthritis . Last year I started having severe lower back pain and went in to see Ortho and had xrays and mri done. That showed that I had cervical spinal stenosis , spondylolisthesis in my mid back, a bulging disc in my cspine, arthritis in the Lspine and one side of the fusion that was done in 1989 never fused. At that time the doctor thought that nothing was severe enough for treatment, but did do some spinal steroid injections that lasted a few months, her next recomendation was for a procedure to deaden the nerves in the lower spine. I have not done this yet as my medical bills have been so high, I have not been able to affford it. Now, I am starting to have more pain in lower back and upper back and neck, my feet and legs seem to fall asleep easier (sitting on the floor, or in the tub), and I keep having this sensation at the very bottom of my spine as if I had Icy|hot there.

Patient: my 11 and a half month old came down with a mild fever this evening and im sure what is causing it. i initially thought it was one of two things. the first being that she bumped her head today on a wooden stool, hard but not extremely hard. a purple mark showed up right away but no raised bump. she cried a minute but long and has been eating, playing and napping normal. the other being that she was fed blueberries a few hours following the head bump and a few hours before i noticed the fever. she has had a mild reaction to blueberries every time shes eaten it, just a mild flesh colored rash on her face arms and belly for a day or two afterwards. (i did cut them out of her diet but they were fed to her on accident). could either the fall or blueberries be causing her fever?  Doctor: Thanks for the query. By your description it seems the child is allergic to blueberries. Kindly do not feed it to her even by accident, as far as possible. Fever may be due to the berries as to have described. Chances of it due to head injury seems less. But a constant vigil is advisable.
Patient: Is there any long term illness that can be a result of sand flee bites. Severe allergic reaction to sand flee bites 3 years ago required a visit to the ER while on vacation in Florida. Several months later full blown symtoms of RA developed and  severe joint and muscular pain is a daily occurance 3 years later.  Doctor: Hello dear, Thank you for your contact to Chat Doctor. I read and understand your concern. I am Chat Doctor answering your concern. Yes, allergic reaction and trypanosoniasis can occur with the sand fly bites. If allergic reaction is severe at first time it will be more severe on second time. So in my advice you should avoid the sand fly bites second time. It may be life-threatening on second time. This both condition can cause joint pain, pancytopenia and other symptoms. You should examine yourself for the trypanosomia. Peripheral blood examination and bone marrow examination can be helpful for diagnosis. Bone marrow examination can help diagnose the various morphological forms of the parasites. Once you treat the condition all the problem will be solved. Please use repellant, net and personal protective equipment for the prevention.

Patient: I am 58 yr old female, smoked almost 40 yrs. Last June I had a heart attack had 3 stents inserted. I did quit smoking. A friend died within 2 years of his heart attack and stent placement. This has me nervous. Is there any data on an average lifespan of patients after stents inserted. I stopped smoking, take all meds, try to exercise when i can, but there is a lot of stress in my life. What can I expect?  Doctor: Dear, The story goes on like this :1- the heart coronary arteries gets narrowed by many factors including smoking, hypertension and increased cholesterol level .2- the blood flow to the heart muscle decreases, so it can't do its job perfectly.3- the patient experiences an anginal pain (chest pain) on exercise or at rest due to ischemia (low blood flow).4- the patient goes to the Emergency department and discovers one of two : 4a - the heart is still 100% functioning but Ischemic (no cardiac cell injury) 4b - the heart has cell injury (Myocardial Infarction) and below 100% functioning .5 - after investigations, the patient performs catheterization, and does one of three : 5a - has to put one stent or more to widen a narrow coronary so increase the blood flow to the heart.  5b - the narrowed coronary arteries can't be widen by stents so he/she has to do open-heart surgery to replace them (CABG) 5c - the patient cant stand stents or CABG so he/she will go on medical treatment life long. N.B. : any procedure of the above depends on how the heart performs its job, and it is defined by Echocardiography .this sequence to show you that, if you have a stent or more, so you still have the chance to do CABG later on if one of these stents has complications. Concerning the lifespan, 1- lifespan of stents varies from 5-10 years according the type of the stent .2- lifespan of patents with CABG varies from 5-17 years according to the type of CABG (venous graft or arterial graft) considered no other complications. So, 7 years for a stent + 10 years for CABG = 17 years lifespan (average) considered a perfect heart with good systolic and diastolic function (each per age) . I wish that I gave you the point ... Thanks for asking.

Patient: Hello! My boyfriend and I were watching a movie when some heavy petting occurred. Eventually he started fingering me but stopped because it was too painful for me. Instead he massaged my clitoris. During that time period I was giving him a hand job, I got a bit of pre-cum on my fingertips. Now after that I can t remember which hand I used, it was either the one with the pre-cum or the one without -its been killing both him and I to remember- but anyways, I used the hand to adjust his hand that was playing with my clit. My finger accidentally slipped and I touched my clitoris area (surrounding area) with the fingers that may have been covered in pre-cum. Yes, I was wet. But is it possible that I may become pregnant?  Doctor: Hello, No, there is no chance of pregnancy in this type of sexually activity. It is quite rare. Pregnancy depends on proper timing of ovulation and unprotected sex with ejaculation. You need to wait for next coming period and if it is delayed more than 7 days, one home pregnancy test is advisable to be sure. Practice safe sex in the future. Good luck.

Doctor: Here I suggest with patients who are diabetics along with hypertension problem its common that they develop often swelling on feet and ankle area. Now when we see there is a discoloration of skin along with swelling that means there is a problem with circulation too. As well if this area start paining along with change in skin color then it's time to do some tests like Doppler study and sensory evaluation for your lower limb blood vessels and nerves. And based on that only the treatment can be planned. I suggest going ahead and Don't be scared of doing any test or with test report. Because if there is something happening wrong you need to know what it is and take treatment in early stage, so you can cure it fast and come out of it early. Since you are diabetic with different joint arthritis as per your explanation, I also think so that there is a problem with nerves and blood vessels supplying to lower limb. However the conformation can be done only with physical evaluation and test report. I can only suggest doing some stretching exercise for legs to improve circulation and take the treatment properly. Think positive live healthy take appropriate rest and balance diet as per your medical health. And once you start recovering do regular exercises like stretches, walking or cycling etc. Take care.

Patient: I am having a biopsy Tuesday for Microcalcifications , deemed suspicious , they are in one cluster and a couple more less than a centimeter away . How likely is that to be cancer and if so can they treat it by doing a lumpectomy instead of Mastectomy?  Doctor: Dear mam. Since the biopsy is suspicious. I hope mammogram is done. We need to look into the size of the lesion. If its just focal, it can be removed by lumpectomy with wide local excision, and we need to ask the pathologist to look into margins of the specimen. If margins are clear, nothing to worry. If affordable, better that you get a FDG PET scan done and look if it's abnormal. If focal same lumpectomy can be done with follow up. If Microcalcification are diffuse, we need to c if its benign r malignant, extent of involvement and later take a call on how much of Brest needs to be removed. Hope this information is helpfulThank u

Patient: can a ganglion cyst ( or other bump sort of thing because I m not sure if its a cyst or something worse) cause uncontrollable muscle twitching it has been on my hand for a long while now, I read somewhere its best not to mess with them and let them heal or dissolve on there own, but I m quite concerned with recent muscle spasm my thumb twitches randomly now and I noticed its almost as it goes with my heart beat, could it be blood passing threw my body and puts pressure on the cyst and makes the muscles react? and is there any way to remove a cyst quite large or small without surgery, I have heard hit it with a book to pop it, but I dont want to pop it incase its filled with a toxic fluid much regard too you please and thank you  Doctor: You must show to an orthopedic surgeon.

Patient: I am a 50 year old female and have always been in good health. About four weeks ago I was diagnosed with viral meningitis after a CT Scan, MRI (with and without contrast) and a lumbar puncture. I never had a fever or stiff neck - only a headache that would not go away and vomiting on several occasions. I also developed double vision about 10 days after the headache started. The day before the double vision started I had received a clean MRI; however, once my vision was affected (on a Friday afternoon) my primary doctor suggested I may need to go to the ER. The next morning on Saturday I felt worse and experienced more vomiting so I headed to the ER. They admitted me and after 5 days in the neuro ICU and a round of every test they could run, the final diagnosis was (or it seemed like their best guess) was viral meningitis. I ve now been home from the hospital for three weeks and still do not feel well. Additionally, I have seen a neuro-opthalmologist specialist that agrees with the diagnosis. She reviewed the results of the lumbar puncture as well as conducted a round of tests, and she did not find any permanent damage and believes the double vision is post-viral. I still have headaches and feel like I am slightly dizzy and like I am in a bit of a fog. My neurologist says to rest, drink plenty of fluids and be patient; however, I am very depressed and worried that I am never going to feel well again. Also, the double vision is terrible...although the opthalmologist says it is normal for this to take up to several months to go away. Additionally, the neurologist says you are fortunate that you did not suffer a stroke, seizures, memory loss...and that you are walking and talking . While I am greatful that I did not suffer those things, I have not worked in 5 weeks and have no quality of life. The feeling of being in a fog is worse than the headaches. As soon as I get up and start moving around, I feel strange and feel like I should sit down. I am eating and drinking the fluids as the doctor suggested and resting all the time. Because I m not getting any real clear answers from the doctor, I have spent a lot of time reading articles on the Internet and I am very scared now. Most documentation out there says I should have been better in 7-10 days with Viral Meningitis; however, there are numerous stories of people that say their lives have never been the same and they were sick for months (some years)! At this point I don t know what to do. If I go to another Neurologist for a second opinion, I am pretty sure that my insurance will not cover an additional round of the same tests. The current Neurologist is at a loss other than doing a 3rd MRI - and the insurance company has not yet authorized.  Doctor: Hi, I am Chat Doctor.  I have read your question and understand your concerns. Let me try to help you Question : What causes dizziness and double vision after suffering from viral meningitis? Answer : Meningitis Causes Scarring (damage) of Sub arachnoid spaces. It is through these spaces blood vessels that carry blood to your brain stem travel Assume the Blood vessels as flexible pipes (or hoses) that carry water. What will happen if some stones are thrown over them. They will compress the flexible pipes. Isn't tit Same way Due to Meningitis, the areas around the blood vessels (Sub Arachnoid Spaces) are damaged. Hence, they interfere with Blood Circulation to your brain stems causes dizziness and Double Vision Some Times, The Nerves can also be directly involved by the scarring (That is electric lines running along the pipes) Most of these cases will heal completely Anyhow, I would advise you to do another MRI after 4 weeks and compare both Hope you found the answer helpful. If you need any clarification / have doubts / have additional questions / have follow-up questions, then please do not hesitate in asking again. I will be happy to answer your questions.

Mild facet joint hypertrophy is noted at L4-L5 and L5-S1 slightly narrowing the neural foramina. Impression: There are multiple Tarlov cysts in the sacral portion of the central canal resulting in pressure erosion on the sacrum. 2 mm broad-based L4-L5 disc bulge. Mild facet hypertrophy L4-L5 and L5-S1. What does all this mean?  Doctor: Hello Thanks for writing to according to report, you are suffering from mild degenerative disc disease of lumbar spine. Degenerative changes occur in spine due to aging and development of weakness in annulus fibrosis.1. Multiple Taylor cysts are age related asymptomatic cysts found along the exiting nerve roots.2. At L4-L5 level, there is mild loss of water from the intervertebral disc and there is mild disc bulge effacing the thecal sac.2. At L4-L5 and L5-S1 level, there is mild facet joint hypertrophy casing slightly narrowing of the neural foramen.

Patient: My wife having age of 35 years, Since last 20 days, she is suffering from high blood pressure 160 /100 and gastric trouble. I don t understand what is the connection between BP and gastric. Earlier BP was never reported. Daily morning and night-before bed she feels blood pressure. Kindly suggest me the technical reason and how we can come out of it.  Doctor: Dear Sir, Any condition which can cause pain and/or intoxication can contribute to rise in blood pressure. I would advise your wife to take blood pressure medication for some time until gastric problems are solved. Meanwhile, I would advise her to restrict salt, try to lose weight if she is overweight. If her blood pressure remains high after her gastric problems are over, it will mean she has arterial hypertension, she should visit her doctor for regular examinations, and she will need a permanent treatment of arterial hypertension. Hope I could help nourishing a good health to your wife In case of further questions don't hesitate to ask

She may suffer from a treatable neurological or psychiatric condition. You should take her to a neurologist or a psychiatrist because the behavior you describe may be an epileptic phenomenon (a complex partial seizure). He or she will evaluate her to get details of the episode along with any peculiar features that point to a seizure like activity. She may be asked to go for an electroencephalograph (EEG) which detects a seizure activity in the brain. Hope this answers your question.

Patient: Hi, my name is Sarah. I am 19 years old. 5 6 height, about 144 in weight and I take dance class and long walks plus, I do like eating healthy. What I m going to tell you is what I think is wrong with me but you may prove me wrong and give me a better answer so here I go. First off, I have to start off with my first problem, I have Brachial plexus injury in my left arm due to the fact that my doctor pulled me out of my mother s womb when he should of done a c-section. Always he ripped my shoulder tearing a nerve cause me to lose control in my arm. Due to great parent, the worked with my arm so by the age of two I regained control of my left arm again. Though I can only half feel in my arm and half control my arm, I m not that mad about it. However, this is where your going to think I m weird, but please continue to follow with me. Due to being sick for a while I went to a doctor to get some meds. (I did get better but not with the doctors meds just to let you know) Anyways, this doctor, not my normal family doctor,(he was on vacation) keep asking about my period every time I came back to the doctor about the meds. (Big thing is I ve always had a tough time with my period, I was on birth control when I was in grade 9 to help with the heavy cramps and pains during my period, however I ve always had one period that s fine and one that is late over and over again, I never know when I m going to have it. It could be a few days or 2 to 3 weeks after it s due.) So the doctor ask me if my period has started and I told him no, cause this was the one that was always late. So after going to the doctors three times, he gives me the birth control pills for 3 months to take without taking any breaks between them. I m on my 2nd one of the 3 and I am leaking old period stuff. WhicChatDoctores to the place where your going to think I m strange, I have less control over the whole left side of my body from my head to my left foot . I can do grab and shake faster with my right side then my left side. Example: My right foot I can shake it side to side really fast, and when flex my toes I can feel it, where on my left foot it can t shake as fast as the right and I can only feel half when my toes are flexed. So what I m thinking is that whatever nerve was damaged in my shoulder area cause the less feeling and movement in the left side of my body. Also there are to sacks in which my period is stored one on the right and one on the left. What if this is cause my period to be late every second one and cause to leaking cause I have less control with the sack cause it to do this and not close right. Anyways this is what I think, and I know I could be wrong but I just what to find an answer to this problem and if it can be fixed or not. Thank you. I hope to get your answer very soon. Sarah  Doctor: Hi, Thank you for posting your query. I appreciate the detailed description that you provided of your symptoms. First, biracial plexus injury can occur as a complication of difficult labor and delivery (shoulder dystonia), where shoulder of the baby comes out before the head. Treatment is with exercises, and I am glad to note that you have done well. Second, regarding the weakness of left side, it needs evaluation. It could be due to clotting of blood in the brain veins or arteries. An evaluation by a neurologist and a possible MRI of brain may be useful. Regarding the periods being irregular, it is most likely due to a condition called as dysfunctional uterine bleeding. The suspicion that your blood is stored in two sacs, etc. is not correct. Your gynecologist will help you understand your problem better. Best wishes, Chat Doctor.
Patient: I fell a few days ago and it was light, nothing serious or hurting. But recently, I started to have pain on my right butt, right side, lower right back and leg. It kind of feels like straining and aching. I am okay but it usually starts hurting after I lay down for awhile and then get up. It hurts and I often feel breathless or teary, trying to get up. I am only 15 and had ACL surgery on my left knee about eight months ago. I am 5 3 and about 270 pounds. I hope this is enough info for you to answer.  Doctor: Seems blunt trauma that may go easily and pain will go easily. If not take 1 SOS broken adult. You may use turmeric powder in warm milk or water 1/2 tsp once or twice daily. Its natural anti-inflammatory. If doesn't stop, may be nerve is compressed. You have to take lumbar support. Don't bend. Don't lift heavy wt. As the trauma subsides (except that inter vertebral disc spaces should not have reduced), pain will go. Otherwise, physiotherapy and Yoga postures will correct you. But not during pain. Hope it helps you.
Patient: I woke u[p in the middle of the night and found my neck hurts as does my left side.  I thought I might have pulled a "wing" muscle but as the day went on I found it increasingly painful to inhale and my side (from lower to middle back) hurt as well.  Help!  Doctor: Hi thanks for asking question. First you could have simple musculoskeletal pain as you are suspecting. It might be by heavy exercise or weight lifting. Rest and analgesic with hot compression useful for it. Second rule out respiratory problem if suspicious symptoms present like cold or sore throat with fever.X-ray and pulmonary function test seems to be useful for it...PFT useful for diagnosing and differentiating restrictive and obstructive pulmonary disease. If still no benefit then we will do further work up according to more history and physical examination. Take care......
Patient: Hello Dr. ,My son who is 6 1/2 yrs old had a cavity in the upper jaw and got it filled.His cheeks were for numb for some time.So he chewed his cheeks,now even after using antibiotic, pus formed all over his cheeks and still the cheeks are swollen. Can you please suggest me what to do?Thank you  Doctor: Hi, Thanks for asking the query, Dont worry apply local antiseptic analgesic cream topically over the affected area. Take lukewarm saline and antiseptic mouthwash rinses. Maintain a good oral hygiene. Take care!
Patient: Today I was having trouble breathing so I was forced to take deep breaths. On mymy brachiocephalic had shooting pain. I took 2 asprin and about 30min later I felt a lot better. However, I still have to take deep breaths. I do not have insurance. Any advice on what is going on?  Doctor: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. By your history and description, possibility of stress and anxiety related symptoms is more likely. So avoid stress and tension, be relaxed and calm. Take sound sleep of 6-8 hours. Try meditation and yoga. If you still don't improve then you have to consult doctor. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.
Patient: My 3 year old son has had fever and complains of pain in his belly which is localized to one spot about an inch above his belly button. I will point to other areas and he will say no... Right here and points to same spot again. At times he will cry and say again that his belly hurts. This is the 6th day. Fever has been as high as 102.8 under his arm. I ve been giving him ibuprofen to keep it down and ease him. Without that he lays around. With it he is able to get up and play a little bit. He is not eating. Not even finishing a sucker or Popsicle which is very unusual. He is drinking. He is not doubled over in pain. Just acts miserable and will cry/whine on occasion that it hurts  Doctor: Hi. Thanks for your query. The most probable diagnosis of such a pain in a child of 3 years can be inflamed lymph nodes at the base of mesentery (the curtain-like thing which supports the intestines and gives blood vessels, lymphatics and lymph nodes). I would suggest you to have an ultrasonography as soon as possible to find out the reason so that antibiotic treatment can be started. Continue the Ibuprofen. Get started on an antibiotics there is no relief : go for the tests of Blood, Complete blood picture, ESR, Manitou testX-ray chest blood Tidal and all other tests as may be directed by your Pediatrician or Pediatric Surgeon.
Patient: Was in ER last night w/ pelvic pain . A 4 cm cyst was found, but the dr. was also concerned with lab results. Creatinine was 1.88, GFR 34, Neut, Abs 7.1, WBC 11.7. Urine test had ketones at =80 (3+), however, I stay away from all sugar and starch , therefore have a low carb diet, and ketosis is expected and normal I m told. As of today, have red and white blotches on arm, non-itchy. Feel like I ve been drugged. Supposed to follow up with primary care dr on Monday for re-test, but wondering why I could be having these issues. Glucose was 90, BP 120/76.  Doctor: Hi, You have got pelvic pain and a cyst of 4 cm, Leaving aside the blood work, try to have symptomatic relief, and harmony treatment, then you can get treatment for the change in blood work.  I also advise you to have treatment for urine infection, I prefer to give lifetime, anti spasmodic, etc. for primary care, thank you.
Patient: HI.MY SON IS TURNING 9 MONTHS.HE HAD XRAY THIS MORNING.IT SAYS HIS NODULAR OPACITIES ARE SEEN AT THE PERIHILAR AREA.HEART SHADOW IS NOT ENLARGED.THE TRACHEA IS AT MIDLINE.THE HEMIDIAPHRAGMS AND COSTOPHERIC SULCUS ARE INTAC.THE VISUALIZED OSSEOUS AND SOFT TISSUES STRUCTURES ARE UNREMARRKABLE AND THE IMPRESSION UNDER THE RADIOLOGIST PERIHILAR NODULARITIES PNEUMONIA VERSUS KOCHS ETIOLOGY..CAN ANYONE EXPLAIN IT TO US IN A MORE UNDERSTANDABLE?THANKYOU IN ADVNCE  Doctor: Dear Sir/Madam, Let me be clear that this is only the radiologists' interpretation which I am explaining to you. Your sons X-Ray is showing shadows in the perihelia region, which is the area of the lung around the him or the root of the lung, where the main respiratory passages and blood vessels enter and leave. Nodularities means that these areas appear more dense or solid than the other areas. Normal lung appears clear or dark on the X-ray because it contains only air. The modularity in your sons' case according to the Radiologist who has reported the X-Ray is either due to a pneumonia, which is an acute infection of the lungs or due to Koch's, also called Tuberculosis, which is a chronic infection. Both these conditions could look similar on the X-Ray. Definite diagnosis has to be made by the doctor who sees and examines the child in correlation with X-Ray and other tests. In the case of Tuberculosis, this is a special type of chronic infection, the source is always another human being, and it could be through the placenta from the mother also if she is a case. Newborns are given BCG vaccine to prevent TB. Both these infections can be treated by antibiotics, but treatment for TB requires a combination of Chat Doctor.
Patient: The neurologist says that having looked at my husband s MRI it is possible that he has a build up of fluid in the ventricle. He has had chemotherapy for lymphoma in the central nervous system and these new symptoms which replicate a TIA are worrying to say the least. He is now losing speech and ability to process for up to an hour roughly every 10 days. The neouologist seems laid back but I am at my wits end as I can see my husband s personality changing and we are both losing confidence. He doesn t have another hospital appointment until May 15th which is for an EEG. We still await a cognitive assessment and then the neurologist will view the results and we should see her in 3 months! Help please. What do you suggest we do?  Doctor: Hello dear, thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your situation and problem. In my opinion your husband is having mostly HY Chat Doctor.  It is narrowing of ventricles in brain. Ventricles are CSF (cerebrospinal fluid) transmitting system. So any narrowing in it can cause fluid accumulation. This fluid accumulation cause raised ICT (intracranial tension) and this can further cause compression on vital brain areas. This is the reason for personality changes and other neurological symptoms. Honestly speaking, lymphoma with neurological complications carry worse prognosis. You can ask for VP (ventricle peritoneal) shunt to divert the excess fluid and thus reducing ICT. So discuss all these in depth with your neurologist.
Patient: Hi. I have graves disease and 8 months ago had rai which successfully destroyed my thyroid. I am a few weeks pregnant and although my t4 is normal 16.6 my tsh is 5.75 - this is the lowest so far. I know about the probs with a high tsh and I will be monitored more later all going well. Is there a cause for concern at this moment.  Doctor: Hello, and I hope I can help you today. I first want to reassure you that women can and do have healthy pregnancies with thyroid disease all the time. In the case of someone like you, whose thyroid has been essentially destroyed by RAI, your TSH will frequently be high. But as long as your free T4 is normal (which is the actual level of your circulating thyroid hormone) the baby will receive enough hormone for normal healthy development. So as long as your supplemental thyroid medication is at the correct level, your baby will be fine.  It is more important to monitor your thyroid hormone level by the T4 value, however, rather than the TSH. Your endocrinologist likely will check your level every month or two during the pregnancy as most women need more thyroid hormone as the away grows. So in summary, there is nothing to be concerned about right now, and under the right care you should absolutely be able to have a healthy pregnancy. I hope this answer was helpful and reassuring. Best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy,
Patient: i have not eaten solid foods in three days due to the fact that i have painful bumps all over my tongue and my gums are swollen and itchy and they hurt when i brush my teeth i have a horrible headache and i my body temperature is fluctuating pretty drastically please help!!  Doctor: Hello and welcome. Thanks for sharing your concern. Please note that you might have developed chronic periodontitis.Therefore, please see your dentist soon and take a course of antibiotics and analgesics. Take medications for three days and see the changes.Meanwhile, do warm saline rinses and maintain good oral hygiene. This should help. Thanks. Take care.
Patient: I had a lung biopsy 6 days ago they let me go home and said I had pockets in the lung and to take it easy.  Im still short breathed but they said it would take awhile to get over it, how long does it take?Im a 68 year old female and just found out I had breast cancer and now lung cancer.  Thank you  Doctor: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. You are diagnosed case of breast and lung cancer. Biopsy in lung cancer can cause pneumothorax. And this might be the cause for you breathlessness. Other possible causes of breathlessness in lung cancer patient are 1. Bronchitis 2. Malignant Pleural effusion 3. Pneumonia 4. Enlargement of underlying mass lesion. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system, chest x-ray and PFT (pulmonary function test) first the diagnosis of these causes. You may need antibiotic, inhaled bronchodilator and inhaled corticosteroids. Usual time for recovery after starting appropriate treatment is 1-2 months. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.
Patient: I have Lingual nerve damage caused by a needle.  It happened 10 days ago, and is very painful. My dentist has said the only thing I can do is wait for the pain to go.  Ive been reading that steroids might help? Should I push this with him, or is there really nothing that can be done?  Doctor: Thanks for your query. I have gone through your query. The lingual nerve damage takes time to heal it may vary from weeks to months. You have to take analgesics with nerve regenerating agents like capsule neuorobion. Be careful about your tongue and the lingual mucosa since that area will be numb. You can also take an analgesic. I hope my answer will help you take care.
Patient: Upper left back side looks swollen with three lumps and what seems like a cyst all bunched together .. Back looks slighty crooked like left side is being pushed up with constant severe paiN .. This has been slowly progressing for around three years .. Im lost on what this could be and need help  Doctor: Hello, If this condition has been present and progressing for several years very slowly and nothing else going on then, it is probably a benign process but the only to know for sure is to see a doctor who can palpate and examine the lesions and ultimately send you for an appropriate imaging study to define them more precisely.  They could be calcified NODULES or fatty tumors called LIPOMAS.  If they are particularly painful or cause burning/shocklike sensations when moved or compressed they could be NEUROMAS (less likely than the other 2 possibilities).  Another possibility is that you may be suffering from the beginning phases of a SCOLIOSIS to the left.  An X-ray will easily define that entity without much difficulty. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care Chat Doctor.
Patient: For the last two months i have been feeling like something is constricting my lungs and making it very difficult to breathe. It sounds like i am clearing my throat all day. I have went to the doctors office and the ER, they have told me it was my asthma, allergies and a mix. When I went to the ER it was just said that I have allergies with a nasal drip. I was prescribed a new inhaler and some nasal spray. What else can I do to help get over this! I feel like it is driving me insane! Thank you.  Doctor: Hi, Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Asthma is a part of allergic disorders. Post nasal Chat Doctor.  Get done complete hologram, AEC level and spirometry once to diagnose. Your symptoms do not point towards asthma. So tell us if any breathless less, night awakening, difficulty in laughing or playing, what time of the day you suffer from symptoms. For allergic rhinitis you can take nasal steroid spray and antihistamine

For that circumcision should be done in which foreskin removed and tight frenulum released.  Chat Doctor.  I suggest you get investigated with your urine routine microscopic examination as well.

I had one last year and there were no issues. I feel very anxious about it this year; I m wondering if it can hurt my eggs or my ability to get pregnant in any way?

Patient: My husband has continuous pain tightness in gum after wisdom tooth extraction.  He has been to a dentist, periodontal, orthodontist, neurologist, oral surgeon and an ear, nose and throat specialist.  He has been given Gabapenrin, Compamazapine, Prednisone and Cortisone injection...nothing seems to work.  This has been ongoing for 7 months.  Nothing seems to help.  He has been told it is Trigeminal Neuralgia, chronic Sinusitis, etc. But still, no relief.  Can you help?  Doctor: HelloUsually this sort of complications is rare and occurs if the needle which was injected to produce anesthesia causes injury to the nerve involved. It cannot be trigeminal neuralgia or sinusitis. Injury to a nerve takes very long time to heal, and some times can even be permanent but usually resolves within a year. It helps if you take vitamin B complex along with a painkiller tablet like diclofenac. Apply warm cloth near the area from outside.1. Along with it, I need to know if the wisdom tooth was extracted in TGE lower jaw or upper?2. Has the extracted site completely healed?3. Does the tightness of gums he is feeling only in that particular area.4. If possible a photo of that area would be helpful or an image of previous X-ray. It is needed to rule out some other causes too. Thank you.
Patient: Went up in higher elevations with hydrocephalus first time since shunt has been placed.i live at 3000ft elevation as is but went even higher like 4700-5200 ft elevations I felt fine in the mountains but coming back down I feel emense pressure and am nauseous. Is this normal I have a VP and lumbar shunt and Arnold Chiari Malformation  Doctor: Hello, I have gone through your question and I understand your concerns, but this is not normal, and you need to get a ct scan to detect any obstructions of the stent. Please refer to your doctor urgently. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.  Take care
Patient: This past Tuesday I was driving to the clinic thinking I had a kidney infection. While driving I got this tingling sensation from head to toe and shortly there after got horrible cramping of my arm, hands, and feet. Then slowly lost my speech. I thought I was having a stroke. I went to ER where they said my potassium and magnesium levels were dangerously low. I also was told I had a bladder, kidney, and gallbladder infection and a small kidney stone. Its been four days and I dont feel much better.  Im still getting occasional tingling in my face and feel very sluggish. Is this normal?  Doctor: Hello dear, The kidney helps in maintaining the acid-base balance in the body. And any pathology to it in the form of infection or stone can result in imbalance resulting in increased sensitivity of nerve endings at the Neuromuscular junctions. So, the tingling sensation in the face can be attributed to increased sensitivity of the nerves which supply those muscle groups. Other causes can be:1. Electrolyte imbalance- as reported in the ER2. Hypocalcemia- calcium is essential for nerve conduction & decreased level of calcium can cause such symptoms.3. Dietary deficiency of nutrients like It B6, It B12 & Folic acid, etc.,4. Stress & hyperventilation5. Peripheral neuropathy due to metabolic reasonsSymptomatic relief can be obtained by intake of multi vitamins & mineral supplements. However, if symptoms still persist, kindly consult your Physician for a proper clinical examination. Investigations like complete blood count & nerve conduction studies will be helpful. There is no need to worry...you will be fine. Wishing you a good health. Thanks & take care.
Patient: I am an LPN that is taking care of my little cousin who is a 3yr old m and he was diagnosed with pachygyria and in february developed seizures. They re not grandmal, he stares, then rolls his eyes in the back of his head, stiffens arms flexed and legs straight. Of course, as you know he has low muscle tone and I work with him by doing ROM, putting wrist supports and DAFOS on him for atleast 2hrs a day, and also put him in a stander, which he hates, but I m willing to try anything to improve his quality of life. I just really would like his parents to get a little sleep. He s got an appt. w/ a sleep specialist on friday and a sleep EEG in October. I just wanted to know if you had any suggestions. I d appreciate any tips. Thank You, Dee-Dee  Doctor: Hello thanks for asking from Chat Doctor Pachygyria is a congenital disorder with malformation in brain. It usually manifests as seizures, mental retardation, developmental delay. Your cousin is 3 years old, and he is having sudden abnormal movements of extremities with rolling of eyeballs and no loss of consciousness. Most likely these are partial seizures. He is on DAGOS for foot deformities. One thing that need immediate attention is his seizure. Repeated seizures may cause damage to brain neurons which will further potentiate the mental retardation. So control of seizures should be first priority. He has schedule of EEG and after making diagnosis he should be given anti-epileptic Chat Doctor.
Patient: Hi I suffer from chronic testicular pain, I have had this pain for roughly 9 years and have not found relief. I have tried many options. What are the best ways to stop the pain? Is surgical removal a good option. It is the only thing I have not tried. I am a 25yo gay male and do not want to have kids so that is not an issue for me. The pain is debilitating and prevents me from functioning properly. Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  Doctor: Hi, I had gone through your question and understand your concerns. Surgery is the last option and before that the right cause should be found. You need to do at least ultrasound of testicles but MRI scan or scenography would be more accurate. But my opinion is that this is suggestive of chronic epididymitis which is inflammation of part of testicle and this not uncommon in males especially in young age. This is usually treated with 10 days of antibiotics, usually ciprofloxacin and there are no permanent consequences. Masturbation and intercourse should be avoided till pain persist, if possible since I may prolong inflammation course. Some more serious conditions such as tumors or torsion are rare but in doubtful cases you should do Doppler ultrasound or scenography. Orhidectomy as an option may be considered but only if these conservative methods would be unsuccessful. Hope this answers your question. If you have additional questions or follow-up questions then please do not hesitate in writing to us. I will be happy to answer your questions. Wishing you good health.
Patient: I have a 4cm lump at front of throat I discovered yesterday went to my gp who sent Mr to radioolgy at hospital they drained but refilled and took samples yesterday but has not gone away to phone for results tomorrow,  worried what it is I am 35 yrs old female thanks.  Doctor: Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You may have some thyroid swelling.  It can be due to nodular goiter or colloid cyst or some thyroid tumor.  You should go for thyroid function test, ultrasound thyroid and fine needle aspiration cytology.  This will give you exact diagnosis. Then you should take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health.
Patient: yes, I just started taking the drug diltiazem hc 60 mg for hypertension every 12 hrs. the side effect is herendous...put me like in coma state, and could not get out of bed, no matter how I tried. I stop taking it after three days, and only took one in a 24 hour period. I have been taking my blood pressure for the past three days an stable at 117/62 highest was 127/67. I feel a short of breath at times like I do not take in enough air to fill my lungs w/air...I have to make an effort to take in air to fill my lungs. I do not feel I can talk w/out feeling winded. I had phneumonia a couple of years ago which put me in the hospital for 2 days. I caught it as a virus, I never smoked, nor had any kind of lung condition. perhaps nasal allergy but nothing as bad as that. I am a 64yr old femaie. I never feel this shortness of breath when I am exercising at the gym a few days per wk for 1 hour. While I was on the meds I did not have that problem, but then I was asleep most of the time. Do you think I should see a cardiologist? or what could be causing this condition? My email YYYY@YYYY  Doctor: Hi, diltiazem does not cause side effects that you have mentioned, and your BP readings are normal which do not require treatment, you should see a cardiologist for shortness of breath and a neurologist for sleepy feeling.
Patient: I have a rather large lump on my breast. Ive had it for a couple years. Ive tried to be reffered for a mammogram but have been unsuccessful. The first doctor I saw shook it off as nothing to worry about. The second time I was seen I ended up being pregnant and obviously couldnt get one. Over the years the lump has gotten slightly bigger and I am concerned. Everytime I see a new doctor they pretty much ignore me and say Im too young to worry about breast cancer, and that its probably nothing. Ive recently turned 27 years old, and I dont feel Im too young to worry. My cousin was diagnoseed at 29 (years after noticing the lump) and fought her ass off before dying at 38. I guess Im just curious about what some other symptoms might be. If, unfortunately, I do have any other symptoms, maybe I can get a doctor to acctually give a shit and check me out.  Doctor: Hi, As this lump is since long, it requires evaluation of your case. From history, it seems that you might be having Fibroadenoma of breast which is benign and non-cancerous. It requires through annually check up by GAEC. You may require Mammogram to know exact nature of lump. Consult GAEC and get examined and investigated. Ok and take care.
Patient: I was in a car accident about a month ago where i was rear ended at a stop light by a speeding SUV. To make matters worse, this is the third accident in the last 14 months. I have 3 cervical disc bulges,1 cervical disc herniation, 1 thoracic disc herniation contacting the thoracic cord, and 4 lumbar disc herniations with one making contact with the S1 nerve roots. This most recent accident has me completely out of work. In addition to severe pain, i ve been having memory loss, confusion, occasional stuttering and I haven t had much of an appitite. When I do try to eat I hurt extremely bad throughout my adominal region (as if i ve over eaten) after a few bits. i ve already lost 10 pounds and 1.5 dress sizes. I am treating with a Chiro 4 days a week, I ve had a cervical and lumbar epidural, and will be meeting with an Ortho in the next couple of weeks. It seem like everyone is working on addressing my pain issuse, but seem to be neglecting everything else. Please advise what you think my non-pain related sysptoms may be. Thanks  Doctor: Hai.looks like your into post-traumatic stress that too with such major problems. The problems what u have mentioned can be due to new intracerebral changes affecting the motor areas of the brain especially the speech, appetite,memory area please meet your neurologist to go ahead for a ct brain or MRI brain to rule out any cause you have more likely chance of suffering from a small stroke in these areas, due to your be Chat Doctor. Good luck
Patient: Hello Doctor,A week ago, I went surfing and got tossed around a bit. After about an hour, I decided to get out of the water because a stinging pain in my right soleus (inner side of leg above my leash) and pain in my calf. It was a stinging sensation irrespective of whether anything was touching it of not. Did the R.I.C.E thing for a few days. Not as sensitive but still stinging to the touch and I noticed a greenish coloring from my Achilles to the back of my knee. Thought I probably just got hit with my board but didn t really notice when it happened. Problem is that the pain and stinging is not going away. Wondering if I tore something because it doesn t seem to be healing like most bruises would.  Doctor: Hello, your concerns are valid, and since it is not healing, you need to take care. Now first thing. Do you have any problem besides pain on walking, and do you feel an indent over your tendon, if any of the above is true, there is possibility of tear of the tendon, and in that case normally plastering or surgery is must? If it's not that than do not worry, just take some rest, keep limb elevated, and in a few more days things will improve fast, let's be frank, the usual healing period in such injuries is about 3 weeks depending on the severity.I hope your concern has been taken care of. Happy healing.

Patient: I have a bruise on my upper thigh that I have had for about 5 months now and it will not go away it is still the same size as it was when I got it, it doesnt hurt, and it is a dark brownish color. I take iron supplements already could there be something else going on?  Doctor: Hi, Thanks for asking. Based on your query, my opinion is as follows.1. Bruises won't be present for this long, unless you are looking at recurrent bleeding. If recurrent, you would probably have seen at other places.2. Possible hematoma, meet a vascular specialist.3. Also check for bleeding time, PT, APT also to rule out any coagulation disorders. Hope it helps. Any further queries, happy to help again.
Patient: Two years ago I was stricken with Sarcoidosis which has effected my eye sight and lungs. I had my left lens removed because of an infection that is finally clearing. The right eye is being treated for the same infection. I have bronchial problems. I have a touch of COPD now. I do not want to take any heavy drugs for the bronchitis. My thinking may be wrong but the first thing I am usually given is a strong antibiotic. I would like my body to try to help heal itself. It seems that my life has turned upside down and I am depressed also.  Doctor: Thanks gory our question on Chat Doctor. In my opinion you should consult pulmonologist first and get done Pulmonary Function Test (PFT) for the diagnosis of bronchitis. Treatment of bronchitis is not antibiotics only. Inhaled therapy is must. Meter does inhaler containing long acting beta 2 agonist and corticosteroids are needed. Oral steroids are also helpful especially bronchitis associated with acidosis. Antihistamines and anti-inflammatory Chat Doctor.  So consult pulmonologist and discuss all these.
Patient: I just find out today that I have inactive exposure hepatitis when I was young ( Doctor thinks) how serious and what can I do ? your answer really helpful for me , I m so stress out , and I don t know where it comes from .Thank you very much for your time .  Doctor: Hi thanks for your question. Explain me complete report of your viral marker. Usually as you have mentioned inactive hepatitis it could be Bag positive case. You might have negative other hepatitis B marker. Usually after getting acute infection of hepatitis B, very few cases can be converted into chronic hepatitis or carrier of hepatitis B. If Bag positivity remain for more than 6 months than we will confirm carrier state. Avoid stress, repeat your test after 6 months, if antigen positive then you will be carrier for hepatitis B. Even if you come Bag carrier, don't take stress. You can live long healthy life .Meanwhile, you have to follow below instructions for healthy liver condition and to avoid complications related............-More fruits-Avoid transfat-Avoid cheese, meat, butter, chips.-Avoid smoke and alcohol-Use very less oil in diet and use olive or sunflower oil that is rich in omega 3 fatty acid.-Avoid refined food.-Regular 30 minute exercise done-Green leafy veg salad taken more hope you will understand my concern.

As well as a 2.5 cm/ 2.4 cm cyst polyp mucus retention polyp in my left maxillary antrum. I dont see my doctor until next week.

Unless the kids having low urine output or very dull or excessively sleepy or blood in motion or green bilious vomiting...you need not worry.

I suggest you use zinc supplements (Z&D Chat Doctor.
Patient: My 9 month old has had a runny nose (clear mucous) and watery eyes (no redness) for the last three days. He doesn t appear to be fussy or uncomfortable. I do hear the congestion in his nose when he is breathing. Does this sound like a cold, an allergy, or could this be because he is teething?  Doctor: Hi... Thank you for consulting in Chat Doctor. Cough and cold are viral 95% of the times in child Chat Doctor.  For cold, you can use anti-allergics like cetirizine and for nose block, saline nasal decongestants will do. Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15 mg/kg/dose (max ceiling dose 500 mg) every 4-6th hourly, that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol. For cold, you can use Cetirizine at 0.25 mg/kg/dose every 12 hourly for 3 days. For nasal block, plain saline nasal
Patient: I had a TDaP injection in left shoulder. 10 days later shoulder around injection site is still very sore, difficult to raise arm above head, feels like a muscle tear around injection site. No visible swelling or redness. But very sharp pain when trying to use the arm, especially when raising it. Suggestions?  Doctor: Hi, Soreness around the injection site is due to allergic reaction to the vaccination you received. Since there is no visible sign of swelling or redness you need not worry. Take pain relievers like Ibuprofen/Coquitlam when pained. You should get comfortable. Try to keep moving your arm, if you keep it still it will hurt. If you get fever you should contact your doctor. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.
Patient: I just had back surgery s/p fusion had to get a follow up ct scan for fluid pocketsNow on the report theyve noted finding of a 9mm nodule arising enterally from the cortex of the left kidneyIm concerned is this something I need to have further treatment. I have been having left side pain but I related it to the surgery.  Doctor: Hi thanks for posting your query on Chat Doctor. As per your history, a 9 mm nodule could be renal Angiomyolipoma. This needs to be further evaluated through a renal biopsy in case if it's increasing in the follow-up scans. In all such cases of renal masses, a renal cancer should be ruled out.Hence, I strongly recommend you to consult a urologist in case if you pass blood in urine. THANK YOU

Doctor: Yes continue atenolol and pantoprazole tablets 40 mg twice a day for 7 days then once a day before breakfast. Od course there are alternative for atenolol. In view of young age.

Patient: hi doc the last three months i have been suffering some abdominal dis comfort ,last month i took abdominal ultra sound scaning asper the test result i have fatty liver and my spleen also mildly enlarged 2mm could you please advise what are the things i need to be taken for reduse my spleen enlargement  Doctor: Hi, Thanks for posting your query in Chat Doctor, I understand your concern. If the ultrasound has shown you that you have fatty liver and an enlarged spleen, it's bad that you haven't taken treatment for the same since you got the report last month.  The fatty liver (if you have non-alcoholic fatty liver disease) could be the reason behind your enlarged spleen. Or there are many other liver disorders which could have both that you have mentioned.  Leaving an enlarged spleen untreated is very dangerous as it can lead to sudden rupture and massive blood loss and therefore sudden death. I suggest you to consult a physician right away and get a few relevant blood investigations done, like LFT (liver function test) and also other routine tests to rule out other infectious cause of your symptoms. If there is underlying infection, treating it will treat the enlarged spleen too.Otherwise, the doctor might suggest removal of the spleen (splenectomy). Do get the help of a physician at the soonest. Hope this answers your query and my suggestion is of help. Wish you good health, take care.

Patient: hello doctor, My son (7 months old) had fever on last friday and lasted for 4 days .I gave him fevago syrup as prescribed by a doctor near by our area. now fever is not there but i could see some skin allergy (rashes) in the entire body even in the head.He has loose motion also(3 times a day). Could you suggest some diet for him and also some remedy for his skin allergy. Usually i give him cerelac, idly and any 1 vegetable like carrot and potato apart from breat feeding ( 3 times a day). Thanks in advance for your help  Doctor: HI...fever followed by rash is not skin allergy, and it could as well be a viral illness with rash or viral exanthem. Unless there is severe itching which manifests in kids as irritability ...there is no need to use any medications, and it is usually self limiting...that is it will settle by itself spontaneously. The other option is that for the rash you can use Calamine lotion application to soothe the sensation. Regards -
Patient: I am taking a 50mg tablet daily for blood pressure over 4 years. I am  53 years.6 weeks ago my reading was 153 over 98 and yesterday when I got another reading in a health store it was 166 over 104.I am worried about this but for last two weeks I am getting stress headache over problem with girlfriend-maybe this is the cause. I eat healthy and exercise 6 days a week walking fast. Have not drunk alcohol in 3 weeks.my weight is fine at 12 stone 4 pounds and 6 feet tall.What should i do please.  Doctor: Hello and thank you for using Chat Doctor. I carefully read your question and I understand your concern. You should not worry about. I will try to explain you something and give you my opinion. You should know that when we treat hypertension our goal is to keep mean blood pressure values below 140 / 90 mmHg. A person might have high value during emotional and physicals trees so It's mandatory to judge on mean values. It is possible that a stressed period might affect your blood pressure values. If I was your treating doctor I would recommend some examination like a cardiac echo to evaluate heart function and walls, a full blood analyze to check your renal function and a holder pressure monitoring to evaluate your values during day and night. After all this we can better judge and exclude secondary factors of these values and of they are really high in mean time. If it results so, then you can rise your medical dosage or add another class, but you should discuss this with your doctor after previous examinations. Hope I was helpful. Best regards, Chat Doctor.
Patient: I have a calcified granuloma in one of my right lower pelvic iliac chain lymph nodes. I have been experiencing a lot of right side lower back and lower abdomen pain I went to the doctor and they ordered a CT scan it showing that there is more calcification appearing in the lymph node. the doctor has  prescribed 600-800mg of ibuprofen three times a day. is thereanything else that I could do for  the pain it seems like a lot of Motrin, and could this be causing  so much pain?  Doctor: Hi. This is a very rare finding of having calcified lymph nodes causing so much pain as described by you. Ideally the lymph node should be removed for further evaluation, and also a diagnostic laparoscopy may find the cause of why lymph nodes are enlarged and calcified. Can this is being something like abdominal tuberculosis or other diseases - needs evaluation before a specific treatment is done. The low-back ache can have another reason like sprain or so.
Patient: i am having a very severe hairfall, very little hair left i am undergoing a lot of stress  and depression. i am having a 4 months old baby who is a down syndrome baby i am unable to cope with it,i have had my blood test done my thyroid is normal and iron level 10.5.pls help  Doctor: Hello, Thank you for posting on Chat Doctor. I appreciate your concern regarding hair fall. Hair fall is usually ascribed to multiple factors like diet and nutrition, hormones, stress, acute or chronic medical conditions, Chat Doctor. From your description, it seems you might be having Halogen Effluvium, which is hairball secondary to stress. If I were your dermatologist/trichologist, I would like to take through history including family history, history of recent major trauma/illness/stress/medications etc. and recommend some basic investigations like CBC, blood sugar, Thyroid function test. Some other special investigations like pictogram and endoscopy and further aid in diagnosis and prognosis. I would suggest you a course of oral tablets containing biotin and other essential vitamins and minerals for minimum 3 months. Also, would put you on solution containing 5%/10% minoxidil once a day and a hair serum containing peptides for hair growth at night.(Q era etc.). I would advise use of gentle shampoo and conditioner on regular basis and use of coconut oil twice a week. Also inquire from your dermatologist about upcoming treatment options like monotherapy and platelet-rich plasma. Avoid combing in wet hair and let them
Patient: I experienced hypoxia due to atrial fibrillation (2x in 4 hours), Brugada Syndrome , 6 years ago. i survived because my body went into seizure due to hypoxia ( I assume) but I have been left with what I think is anomic aphasia. I now have an ICD. Is this a reasonable assumption, the aphasia, on my part? All my doctors have basically ignored my memory issues. I have recovered considerably but still have issues with pulling names of things, etc out of my mind. Fortunately my intelligence doesn t seem to have been affected.  Doctor: Hi, Sorry to hear about your current concerns.  Yes, it is a reasonable assumption on your part to think of atomic aphasia after the seizure. It is possible.  You will benefit maximum by getting a combination of tests that include verbal/speech test and an MRI of the brain. I am glad to that your intelligence in preserved. Take care of the atrial fibrillation.  Wish you good health.

Patient: hello my name is elizabeth and me and my husban lisban were in a car accident recently, he is currently in the hospital with inflamed lungs (swolen lungs) the doctors say that the cause of it was because during the car accident he vomited and swollowed it and went to his lungs, will he be ok?  Doctor: It depends on the severity of the injury. What they are likely referring to is aspiration pneumonitis. Sometimes this is mild and only causes minor symptoms like coughing. On the other hand, sometimes this can be very severe and require breathing on a ventilator. His prognosis depends largely on the severity of the inflammation currently. If there is diffuse damage to both lungs, it implies severe disease. If only a small area of one lung is affected, it implies a better prognosis. I hope this sheds some light on the issue.
Patient: I am currently taking Levothroxin for my thyroid. I was wondering if I should take Oxy elite pro in conjunction with this medication. I was planning on taking Oxy Elite Pro before I work out in the morning and then take Levothroxyn 45-60 mins later. Is this is a good or bad idea?  Doctor: Hi, It is not safe take OXY elite pro while on levothyroxine. OXY elite is promoted for weight loss however the US Food and Chat Doctor.  As per the confirmed FDA laboratory analysis OXY elite contains fluoxetine which is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) commonly prescribed to treat depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and other conditions. It can cause serious side effects including suicidal thinking, abnormal bleeding, and seizures. Although there is no documented evidence of any harmful interactions between Levothyroxine and OXY elite pro however to be on safer side it is better to avoid taking it. Levothyroxine itself may be effective in reducing your body weight so continue taking it along with regular exercise and diet to control your body weight. Hope I have answered your question.

Patient: Hi my three year old son is having recurrent laryngitis as told by my paediatrician ..wwe have given him oral steroids twice.it gets relieved for few days again to repeat...we are also giving him budecort 100 puffs bd and montair 4mg in night time ...still this problem...please help  Doctor: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Oral steroids are given in certain situations only. And severe laryngitis is one of the indication for this. But it should be given regularly for recurrent problem because it can cause many long-standing side effects. So better to avoid oral steroid and increase the dose of inhaled steroid. Inhaled steroids are not having systemic side effects and thus safe for long term use. Infection is the most common cause for recurrent laryngitis. So do annual Influenza vaccination to prevent this. Discuss all these with your treating doctor and plan accordingly. Better to avoid oral steroids frequently. Hope I have solved your query. Wishing good health to your son. Thanks.

Patient: I m sitting here next to my husband. He has end stage liver cancer from cirrhosis & hep c. He breathes then stops. I knew that would happen. But I just came upstairs & he has orange foam coming from his mouth. What s causing this & the color. It s terrifying me.  Doctor: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. There are many causes for breathlessness in end stage liver cancer.1. Congestive cardiac failure (CCF) due to low proteins and low hemoglobin. 2. Metastases in lung.3. Metastases in pleura and produce malignant pleural effusion. But in my opinion CCF appears more as foam like think coming from mouth is seen in pulmonary edema. And orange color may be due to high bilirubin as a sequela of end stage liver cancer. So this can be the cause for yellowish orange foam coming out from your husbands mouth.
Patient: i have a knot in between my rib cage tha size of a quarter feels like a cists it doesnt hurt or nothing but i noticed i have bad breath now also has been there 6 months or better jus curious to what it might be an are the two possibly linked? im 42 afro-american female 5 2 an weigh 131 ibs i am anemic but my hemoglobin has been good for months dont have any medical issues i am prone to bv though have had it a lot in the past  Doctor: Hi.based from your description, it could possibly be a cyst (sebaceous or gelatinous type), a fibrous (fibrous tissue formation) or a lipoma (a fatty tissue deposit).

Management (medical and/or surgical) will be directed accordingly. A good oral hygiene is also encouraged. Hope this helps. Good day!!~ Chat Doctor.
Patient: My 5 yr old has a noticeable indention to the top of his head where the coronal suture runs. When he was 2yrs old he had fallen out of a shopping cart and struck his head. CAT scan appeared normal. This indention has never been noticed since he has always had long hair however now that he s had crew cuts and the hair is growing in, the indention is noticeable. The sides of his skill bulge a bit before the coronal suture. Will this create further problems while his skull grows and should a pediatric neurologist be contacted for consult?  Doctor: HI...if he is developmentally normal and doesn't seizures and any other neurological abnormality, I don't think this is related to the fall he had sustained 3 years back. Even now without any neurological abnormalities, you don't need a neurology consult. I suggest you consult your pediatrician first and then if needed he will be the better person to suggest further action as he will be physically examining the kid. Regards -

Now it seems to be more frequent-and the pain is worse.  Ive had a CT and they said they didnt see anything...but this pain is BAD.  Doctor: Hi. CT scan has no power to see and diagnose everything, although this is the best investigation for abdominal pain. You have a classical complaint lower stomach and back pain after food with acidity. This can be caused by colitis(inflammation of large bowel) the pain increases as a reflex from a full stomach. I would advise a stool test, colonoscopy may be enterocolitis.

Patient: I have had slight testicular pain for about 2-3 days. I just went for a 3 mile run (which is not a unusually long run for me) and when I returned to shower it was hurting more. I checked and there was fairly significant purple coloration to my entire scrotum. I have had no trauma to the area  Doctor: Hi there! . Does the purplish discoloration disappear after some time? Do you notice it just after exercise? Or does it remain the entire day? The reasons for the discoloration could be a fungal infection, or an infection of the tube Chat Doctor.

Patient: Hi, I have been to the doctors today. Given antibiotics for my chest infection. She is referring me to haemotology (urgent). Apparantly I was diagnosed with Christmas Disease in 2012 it says on the doctors pc. I was never told tho. I really dont feel that well. Just taken my diclofenac and Zapain. I have noticed spotting on my feet. I had Idiopathic thrombycitopenia P in 1994. I am scared it may be back.. Could this be anything else? Been sweating loads, out of breath. Chest pain..Generally weakness.  Doctor: Hello! Welcome to Chat Doctor. Thanks for your query. Since a diagnosis of Christmas disease was made that is a blood clotting disorder caused by a mutation of the factor IX gene, leading to a deficiency of factor IX. There is a greater propensity to develop hemorrhage and the treatment is by intravenous infusion of factor IX. Factor IX has a longer half life than factor VIII (deficient in hemophilia A) and as such factor IX can be transfused less frequently. The symptoms of sweating, out of breath, chest pain are most probably due to the underlying Christmas disease which has caused high metabolic state and weakness. Ill advice you to stop medications no own without proper consultation with a hematologist because for instance the medications you had taken (that is diclofenac, paracetamol and codeine) can worsen your condition.  Ill advice you to consult a hematologist for proper line of management of your underlying disease condition. Wish you a good health. Thank you.

Patient: Hello doctor, my 80 year old father is in ESRD written on the discharge sheet and the doctor say as failure. He is advised renal dialysis for the same and has to undergo Arterio- venous fistula for the same. what is Av fistula?  Doctor: ESD is End Stage Renal Disease and the presently your father is in renal failure and needs to Chat Doctor.  As a part of carrying out the dialysis the AV created. An arteriovenous (AV) fistula is an abnormal passageway between an artery and a vein. Although it most often occurs in the legs or arms, an AV fistula can occur anywhere in the body, including the brain. An AV fistula may also be created surgically to provide access for hemodialysis in people with end-stage kidney failure as in your father’s case. Normally, blood flows from arteries through capillaries and back to the heart in veins. When an AV fistula is present, blood flows directly from an artery into a vein, bypassing the capillaries. If the volume of diverted blood flow is large, tissues downstream receive less blood supply. In addition, heart failure may occur due to the increased volume of blood returned to the heart.

When you didn't get relief from back pain for last 2 years, we need more investigation to confirm diagnosis first. I would like to do your MRI of lumbosacral spine with screening of whole spine. This would help in diagnosing arthritis, disc prolapse, infective pathology and instability. At your age arthritis be degenerative or inflammatory. Treatment for both conditions are different.I would also advise radiography of lower spine lateral view in full flexion and extension to rule out instability. Please do these investigations as soon as possible so that we can suggest you better treatment. Meanwhile you can take tramadol 37.5 mg twice a day for pain relief.

Patient: good day doctor,Im suffering from vas deferens pain since some months so I recently got my seminal vesicles injected and my urologist stated that this way also vas deferens, by liquid pressure, would receive the antibiotic. Is that true? because my symptoms didnt change and I recently saw on the net that vas deferens isnt directly connected to the seminal vesicles but both converge into the seminal excretory duct. Am I wrong? Thanks for your time  Doctor: HelloThanks for query. It is very difficult to diagnose pain due to infection exclusively of Va's Difference. It is always due to infection of spermatic cord (Funiculars). Giving injection into seminal vesicle will not give relief from pain due to Funicullitis.

Patient: Respected Dr Sahib, My 9 year old son is undergoing treatment for viral ( antibiotic - Oflomoc Forte administered for 5 days). The fever is continuing on the sixth day with lesser interval . Local Pediatrician has after six days asked for the following tests: CBC+ESR+ SGOT SGPT+ Widal+ MP+ Urine Routine. The Widal test report will be received tomorrow. Presently SGOT SGPT repot is at hand (SGOT 180 U/L) (SGPT 110 U/L). Is It suggestive of Liver problem or has the level increased due to antibiotic admistered for 6 days. Kindly reply please Kindest Regards Sandeep R Karwa  Doctor: Welcome to the ChatDoctorMany diseases and conditions can contribute to elevated liver enzymes. Your doctor determines the specific cause of your elevated liver enzymes by reviewing your medications, your signs and symptoms and, in some cases, other tests and procedures. In my opinion it can occur due to Hepatitis, Long term paracetamol use, typhoid fever, pancreatitis, polymyositis, mononucleosis, Cytomegalovirus or Epstein-Barr virus infection in your child. As the levels are moderately raised and no other symptom apart from fever, typhoid is a more likely cause. I would suggest to look at Tidal test report and also go for a blood culture and sensitivity test. Changing antibiotic to Definite and Azithromycin will help in typhoid. For further questions, do contact us.
Patient: Hi, I m a 33 year old healthy woman. I have a strange dryish feeling patch on my upper inner lip. The two sides of my upper lip don t feel symmetrical - when I run my tongue over the left side (where the dry patch is), it feels almost a little rough, like very fine-grade sandpaper. the right side feels normal and slick. Also, when I purse my lips , the right side still feels smooth and plump on the inside, but the left side, where the patch is, creases into sharp wrinkles . I notice it especially when I m eating - especially drier foods like cereals - which feel like they catch there. And the lip sometimes feels like it catches on my teeth on that side if they re dry. I first notices this about 3 weeks ago. I can t see any discoloration, and it s totally painless, just odd. Should I see a dentist? Or a dermatologist? Thanks!  Doctor: Hias per the information provided by you, I would recommend you to see a dentist to rule out any dental structure(natural or prosthetic) responsible for this patch. Sometimes chronic local irritation from sharp edge tooth or dental prostheses lead to such patch appearance. Am sure that a dental doctor can fully take care of this particular problem. Take care.
Patient: Im just a little concerned, i inserted my ring 3 day late. 5 days later i had sex, me and my partner always use condoms either way...but this night i think the condom broke because when i got up out of bed I felt alot of stuff dripping out of me. I asked him if the condom broke, he says it didnt. I just cant stop thinking about it, can i be pregnant if i was late on my ring 3 days...and had sex 5 days later?  Doctor: Hi, It is unlikely that you can get pregnant, even without any contraception, on the 8th day of your cycle, if you have regular 28-30 day cycles, as you are in the safe period. Added to this, there should be no problem due to late insertion of the ring too. So, please do not worry about the possibility of conception, even if the condom broke. Your chances of conception are very, very slim. You may expect your next period to get delayed if you retain the ring for three weeks, as you inserted it late. Hope your query has been clarified. Wish you good health.
Patient: fell down about 3-4 months ago and my knee received a very bad gash. It is healed but on the scar I have noticed white dots forming. They don t hurt. I popped one and a pimple like substance came out. Are they dangerous? Should I consulat my family doctor?  Doctor: Hello, Welcome, and thanks for sharing your concern I went through your query, and I feel, these could be sign of infection, so It's good to see your doctor with this concern and get yourself examined. I hope my advice would have been useful, in decision-making regarding your treatment, still if you have any clarifications or doubts feel free to contact back. Thanks.
Patient: Last Wednesday I fell down with my back against a wall. My lower back has been a little sore since then but 2 days ago I had extreme pain all of a suddene. It hurt so bad that I cried. The same thing happened tonight. I take ibuprofen and tramadol for pain. I also take Valium. The pain tonight was severe. It lasted about a half hour. I am using a hot pack on it right now. The pain has subsided.  Doctor: Trauma to lower back may cause pain due to local muscle injury and spasm or vertebral fracture depending upon the impact force and mode.  Absence of radiating pain to lower limbs, weakness in lower limb and non involvement of urinary symptoms are pointing towards inexactness of spinal cord. My advice will be to get a X-ray of lumbosacral region to rule out any fracture.  Diclofenac with muscle relaxant and rest may be helpful. Apply local ointment also. Wishing early recover and good health.

Patient: hi I have a son who is already 3 years of age. he suffers from on and off fever so I brought him to a doctor for a check up.Unluckily the doctor is on leave. i just let my son have his urine test. and the test have a positive findings for A. urates/PO4 and mucus threads. What does these mean?  Doctor: Hi...this is normal finding in the urine of any kid who has viral illness. Do not worry about it. The report is normal. Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active. Regards -

Patient: I was wondering if lisinopril causes infertility in women . I was taking this for over 3 years and had been unsuccessful in conceiving a child. I recently switched to aldomet and we shall see if there is any luck. If there is a risk of infertility caused by lisinopril, is it reversible and how long does it take for the medication to be cleared out of your system?  Doctor: Hello!

Patient: Hi Doctor, I was scheduled for spinal surgery afew days ago and I arrived at the hospital for special surgery I was brought in the room to be prepared and the anesthesiologist came to speak to me and said she needed to speak with my cardiologist about my aortic regurgitation problem and she could not reach him. the problem was she was a littleReluctant to continue with my surgery because she said my condition was severe and I was sent home.My cardiologist sent the hospital a letter for clearance about a week before but apparently it wasnt enoughI was very disappointed by the way my number was a 4.  Doctor: It seems the cardiologist should first evaluate aortic regurgitation and manage it before safe anesthesia can be given this is what your anesthesiologist means
Patient: hi my 2 year old daughter was diagnosed with macrophage activation syndrome last year after she had her MMR + Chicken pox shot. She was treated for the MAS and has been on steroids and cyclosporine for last 6 months. One of the MAS symptoms was red rash all over her body and fever. That all cleared away with the meds but it is now coming back since reducing her steroids to bare minimum. It comes and goes throughout the day. When we give her a bath it goes away as if it were regulated by heat. Stress and agitation and tiredness seems to bring the rash out. A part from being told it is an immune deficiency (my daughter was born 3 months premature) the docs don t seem to have a better diagnosis. Any ideas? tx  Doctor: Coagulation profile is often abnormal in MAS which may lead to easy bruising, rash, mucosal bleeding etc. During follow-up visits your doctor will do required blood investigations to make sure all parameters are within acceptable range. As long as coagulation profile and platelets are within normal range, rash alone is not a significant clinical problem in MAS.

It would be prudent to rule out any cardiac arrhythmias by getting a 24 hour Holder testing(Mobile ECG) to rule out any bradyarrhythmias or abnormalities of rhythm and rate. A EEG, other causes of LOC need to be looked for, this includes seizures, TIA and other cause. Syncope needs to be checked for causes of orthostatic hypotension like Chat Doctor. Other causes of syncope like micturition /sneezing /neurogenic/vasovagal or carotid sinus syncope needs to be looked for. It would help to get a thorough neurological, cardiac and medical check up done to establish Theo cause of such symptoms.
Patient: bugling neck vein on left side of neck and on right. The right side is not as large as the left. I was diagnoise with hypertension. I am not overweight, I eat a healthy diet no fast foods etc.. I exercise atleast 5-6 days a week. I ve had blood work everything is within normal range. I had an ultrasound of my heart and kidneys that normal although my heart was slightly enlarged. When I exercise my pressure drop to on average 113-116/75. That s what it was normally before the hypertension showed up. I have head burning in various places on my head especially the back. I am currently taking hp meds but minimal effect. My bp can be anywhere from 135/89 or 173/103 sometimes more even with the meds.  Doctor: I would like to see your echocardiography report. As u told about your neck veins, it might be related to raised JVP (raised pressure in right size. Of heart). And regarding fluctuating BP, what's your age? When u r diagnosed as hypertension? R u having hypotension on sitting or standing position or BP decreased on that position? R u having headache, flushing of face or any other symptoms?

Patient: My left tonsil seems like it is irritated and my left ear feels like it has some pressure. I don t have a sore throat and only happens when I drink or use smokeless tobacco... it comes and it goes. usually goes away in a few days but seems a little worse this time... i have only used smokeless tobacco for 2 and 1/2 years off and on.. not really consistently. I have allergies pretty bad but i kinda of take things overboard and always think its cancer ...  Doctor: Hello Throat irritation is often associated with ear symptoms - like fullness or pressure.  There is tube connecting the two - Eustachian tube - middle ear to oropharynx (throat).  The tonsil irritation could be from infection (virus, bacteria, sometimes a fungus) or allergy or even mechanical - from food and so on.  Post nasal Chat Doctor.  Tobacco in ANY FORM is bad.  Only the effects of additives like tar and so on are avoided by the the so-called smokeless tobacco.  You seem to be intelligent and informed / partially motivated-you MUST try and stop the tobacco It doesn't sound like cancer now - but one is never sure - see you doctor - anything suspicious should be biopsied (sample for analysis)Take care Good luck

Patient: My girlfriend and I have since the start of our 2 year relationship been experiences problems that appears to be sexual inadequacy. We just dont seem to have the chemistry to excite each other. We both led a normal sexual life before but with each other it is always a struggle.

Patient: Hello - My mother was diagnosed with autoimmune cholangiopathy in 2005.  She began her treatment with prednisone and responded positively to it and was then take off of the prednisone.  After being take off, her liver levels elevated again and was put back on steroids and is now on Urso and Imuran for the rest of her life.  Since 2008 she has been experiencing sporadic nausea which has become increasingly debilitating this last month.  Can you please give me a prognosis for autoimmune choloangiopathy in patients who are being treated for it?  Doctor: Hi and welcome to Chat Doctor. Thanks for the query. If there is as good response on treatment then it should not reduce lifetime but some complications such as liver cirrhosis may occur. In case of cirrhosis, liver transplant may be required, but this usually happens in late stages of the disease after20-30 years. Today's therapy is very efficient, and you can hope for normal life. I hope I have answered your question. Wish you good health. Regards
Patient: Why does my stomach and back hurt? I feel tired, sluggish, nauseated and get headaches. I feel like I can t eat at times. I have been using the birth control patch faithfully... I had a baby ten months ago and I am experiencing the same symptoms I had when I first got pregnant. I took a pregnancy test and it came back negative. Maybe it could be to early to detect? But if not pregnancy what else could possibly be going on?  Doctor: Its probably fatigue and indigestion caused by AAM - a kind of mucous caused by indigestion and hampered metabolism that gives rise to symptoms presented by you. Its well established scientific theory in Ayurveda. Later, most of the time it gives rise to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Best way is to use the procedure to cleanse the bowels and flare up the digestive system that will correct the metabolism too. This cycle completes in 2-4 weeks. Make a habit to avoid heavy food. Use warm water Chat Doctor.  Avoid cold

Some pass 4 to 5 times per day others 3 to 4 times per week. If your baby is comfortable, abdomen is soft, feeding normally, no vomiting etc. then these findings are more important than mere frequency of bowel movements. Constipation is passing hard and Chat Doctor. Constipation in breastfed babies might be due to deny

Am taking tablets tegretal 200 3 times aday , gabatin 400 3 times a day and duzela 20 2 times a day from last 4 years but still I have stiffness andvpain on my face. Pls give me your advice Regards, Mrs. Arpita.  Doctor: Hello, I have gone through your question and understand your concern. Facial pain is a debilitating type of pain, but it does not come from your facial nerve but from the trigeminal nerve. Anyway, you are already on full Chat Doctor.  You might increase the regret dose, but this might have some adverse. The next step in my opinion is injecting glycerol in the trigeminal ganglion, which is a minimally invasive treatment with good outcomes, but there is high probability of recurrence this does not help I recommend a cerebral MRI to see if there is a neurovascular conflict of the trigeminal nerve after it leaves the brain stem. In case there is this situation you can do a microvascular decompression, which is very invasive but with a high percentage of pain relief. Hope this answers some of your questions, please feel free for further questions
Patient: Hello, my wife has been dealing with left leg pain and weakness for the past 15 years. Recently my wife developed left arm, face and tongue weakness and numbness. She was diagnosed with a 5mm Chiari malformation and was given steroids to relieve migraines. After seeing a neurosurgeon she was told she was ineligible for surgery and has been told that she may be making up the symptoms in her head. We don t believe that, basically her left leg, arm and now face experiences pain and weakness and we have no idea why. She was tested for MS but with no lesions and multiple side symptoms that was rules out. Any advice you can provide would be appreciated.  Doctor: Hello! Thank you for asking on Chat Doctor ! I read carefully your question and understand your concern. Coming to this point, I would recommend performing a cervico-thoracic spine MRI study to exclude possible syringomyelia, which could cause her symptoms. This is a common complication of Chary Malformation. Anyway, it would not explain the numbness in her face or tongue. Another option would be starting an antidepressant, especially considering the fact they she suffered from migraines. These Chat Doctor.  Hope you will find this answer helpful! Best wishes,
Patient: I had a slight dizzy spell the other morning, checked my blood pressure and it was 111 over 62. This was about 1230 pm. I had forgotten to take my blood pressure medicine that morning. I am taking lisonoprill and carvedol. I am a male and 84 years old.  Doctor: Hello! Thank you for asking on Chat Doctor! Regarding your concern, I would like to explain that your symptoms don't seem to be related to the blood pressure changes. These are normal values of blood pressure, and are not causing your symptomatology. The fact that you have forgotten to take your medications, has not influenced very much on your blood pressure (we should expect a higher blood pressure, caused by the lack of the antihypertensive therapy effect). I recommend consulting with your GP for a careful examination, a routine blood test, kidney and liver function tests, blood electrolytes. A Doppler ultrasound of the neck vessels would be necessary to examine the blood flow to the brain and detect possible stenosis of carotid and vertebral arteries. A cervical spondylarthrosis can cause a similar clinical scenario at your age. So a cervical spine x-ray is needed to exclude this. Meanwhile, I recommend taking plenty of water. A good HY Chat Doctor. Hope to have been of help! Greetings!

He is also feeling very tired and is generating a lot of heat from his body as if he has a fever but doesn t himself feel feverish. He suffers with RA and takes large doses of methotrexate.

Patient: I had an extraction a few months ago because of an infection. Since the extraction I have a lump under the jaw where the tooth was. I was given an x ray which showed a dark show in that area and given stronger antibiotics for 5 days. Im worried that this could be more serious.  Doctor: Dear sir/mam, welcome to Chat Doctor. You have not mentioned the dark shadow is well-defined or not. If it is well-defined then it is cyst, if it is not then periapical infection. A tumor is a growth caused by an overproduction of cells. A cyst is similar to a tumor, except that it is filled with fluid. Both tumors and cysts can form in the bone of the maxillofacial region, most frequently in the lower jaw bone, or mandible. The antibiotics are given to control the infection. Donot worry the dental surgeon will take care of it. You can consult an oral maxillofacial surgeon for second opinion. Thank you, Chat Doctor.

Patient: Sure!  An MRI on 7-10-13 indicated " ...persistent focal T2 signal hyperintensity within the left caudate nucleus and anterior limb of the internal capsule with corresponding susceptibility on the gradient sequence.  Findings suggest a small amount of hemosiderin of remote hemorrhage.  No evidence of acute hemorrhage...."   I do not recall everything the neurologist explained.  I was rear-ended in early March and hit my head on the top left side and had a goose egg for a few days.  I have been diagnosed with a concussion and my symptoms are related to focus and memory and "brain drain".  Can you educate me on the MRI indication?  Thank you!I do not wish to sign up for any fee.  Sorry, and thank you.  Doctor: HI, Thank for choosing Chat Doctor, The Hemosiderin is not an indication of fresh bleeding, this is one reason for not to worry, second it is direct indication of deposition of some residual elements after dying the red blood cells in case of rupture blood vessels and bleeding from it, in later stage the phagocytosis will play the role, once the phagocytosis start then the lesion will go away, in short right now nothing to worry, but close observation will be needed, you will have to go for MRI periodically, and discus it with your neurologist, Have good day.
Patient: I have a question for you... My husband and I have been trying to get pregnant for 2 years now and nothing has been happening. I kind of am starting to worry we wont be able to have kids? What steps can we take to try and become pregnant? Is there pills that will help me to become ovulated and get fertile to be able to have children? I am 20 years old, and am just looking for some answers.. Am I not ovulated/fertile yet to have children? I also only do get my menstrual cycle every 3-4 months, would that have something to do with it? and would getting on Birth Control possibly help the situation?  Doctor: Hi dear. You have so many queries. Don't be so anxious. If you are already having periods after 3-4 months, did you ever get your scan done and is it polycystic ovaries. If so you need to get a consultation from a gynecologist and work step by step to achieve pregnancy. First get semen ex. of husband. What about your weight and BMI. Get ovulation study done to see whether the cycles ovulatory or not. Get hormone profile done.Don't get disheartened. You are only 20 years old and take proper guidance. Thanks.

Patient: How long can a patient live when cancer spread from the cervical to the brain? The patient already had a mild stroke which has the left side of patient unresponsive, loss of speech and experiencing pain  all over. The only way of communication is via eyes and movement of head and a slight movement on the right hand and intense pain when moved.

Patient: My wife in her teens was diagnosed with nuro-cardio-genic-syncope. They thought she d out grow it but she hasn t and now she is 35. Through the years she has had many tests locally including the tilt table test. She says that she is the reason why the straps were redesigned on the table because when she was 13 she passed out on it and fell through every one of them. She mainly passes out after she has done something streinous the following day; or if her body is weak from a virus; or from over heating like when in Florida. They have measured her blood pressure on the tilt table clear down to 60/20 when it dips. Usually it will dip and causes her to pass out. Her presser comes back up however she is unable to speak for about 20 min. and is weak for the next few days. She said its like her entire body falls asleep and then is waking up with the feeling of needle pricks all over her body. My question is that is comes and goes and now that she is older it may happen maybe 6 times a year. However, she has to be careful now to over exert herself. They have rulled out any heart problems or ceasures. She is a little worried now because she is getting a new sensation. We just got back from a youth retreat with kids for 4 days and she is exhausted. The next day she passed out a coulple times. What is new is that her legs are feeling like they are vibrating periodically. She says it seems to make her weaker whan it happens. I know this is a lot but I wanted to give you as much info as I can. Have you ever come across anything like this? Any ideas or suggestions? The only thing we do is have her lay down and sometimes thats for days and give her salty foods or gaterade which seems to help.  Doctor: You should consult psychiatrist and neurologist to rule out any anxiety disorder or as u said euro cardiogenic shock.  She would be better with start of treatment.
Patient: Hi my name is Merlyn 35 years old I have bronchiactasis I admit in hospital in how many times I supper to long already I always told to the dr I want to undergo to operation but the dr. Always told i m to young im so tired in this .My question is if I undergo to surgery im become will in the bronchiactasis what the best I can do im so tired about this  Doctor: Hello, No, it is not true. In fact, surgery is indicated in a young patient with bronchiectasis. If your bronchiectasis is in the single lobe and your pulmonary function test (PFT) values are good, you are an ideal candidate for lobectomy (surgical removal of bronchitis part of the lung). So better to consult CVTS surgeon who does lung surgeries and discuss all these. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

Doctor: Hi, There are many medications that are not antiseizure medications which can be useful against TN such as Tricyclics (nortriptyline, amitriptyline, desipramine, duloxetine, migraine), muscle relaxants (Baclofen, Tizanidine), and calcium channel blockers (Verapamil, Diltiazem, Expletive).  TN is a very challenging problem to resolve.  I'm curious to know what they actually gamma knifed and hope that doesn't result in long-term chronic central pain syn Chat Doctor.

Patient: I had been given lithium high doses 1200 mg by mistake for 2 weeks without knowing it i became weeker and weekerand i finally was brought to the hospital and they found i had lithuim toxicity and my kidneys were failing!  I was athe hospital the transitional care for a month after. I would like to know how my kidneys have had damage and couldthe damage be reversed?  Doctor: Hi, In my experience, if your blood urea and creatinine levels have come down to within normal limits after treatment for lithium toxicity, then you do not need to worry about lasting damage. I find lithium a very safe and effective medicine provided it is prescribed and taken correctly. I start lithium in low dosages and gradually hike up after serum lithium level monitoring. Probably this was not done in your case. Best wishes.

Patient: hello after abdominal pain in my lower back and left leg I started to feel the numbness: it goes in my left foot, left thigh, left buttock and a bit in left side of my vagina/rectum. MRI showed S1 compression- but a neurologist says it has nothing to do with my genital area. I found on your website a very similar cause- and the doctor said it s NERVE COMPRESSION. my question is: how long you can have it before it s too late for surgery? can S1 affects genital area? what specialist I should see about it? (Neurologist said : find a good PM&R doctor) When the numbness goes away? how can I know the nerve is not damaged? here are my MRI results Please HELP !!! Findings: Mild disc desiccation consistent with degenerative disc disease is noted within the lumbar spine. At L1-L2 and L2-L3 no neurocompressive changes are identified. At L3-L4 there is annular disc bulging with flattening along the ventral margin of the thecal sac. No resultant central or foraminal stenosis is seen. At L4-L5 there is annular disk bulge with impression on the thecal sac. Disk material causes encroachment within the inferior left neural foramen. At L5-S1 there is central and left paracentral disc herniation with impingement and displacement on the left S1 nerve root in its lateral recess. More diffuse disc bulging also cause encroachment within the bilateral neural foramina. Degenerative endplate changes are seen at the L5-S1 level. The vertebral bodies demonstrate normal height and narrow signal characteristics. The conus medullaris is at the L1 level and displays normal morphology. IMPRESSION Central and left paracentral disc herniation L5-S1 with impingement upon the left S1 nerve root. This is superimposed on more diffuse disc bulging. Degenerative endplate changes at this level is also noted. Annular disc bulging at L4-L5 with impression on the thecal sac. Annular disc bulging is also noted L3-L4.  Doctor: Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor, The intervertebral discs are cartilaginous structures present between vertebrae. The disc acts as lubricant for smooth motion of the vertebral bodies during movement of the spine. At times the disc starts bulging out from its normal position. The bulging disc starts impinging nerve roots which emanate from the spinal cord. The nerve emanate through small foramina in the vertebral bodies. These foramina are intact in your case. In your case, discs are bulging at the level of L4-L5 and L5-S1. Due to the compression, the area supplied by these nerves are affected. This is responsible for the pain and numbness in the foot region. The S1 nerve does not supply the genital region. The treatment for this condition is complete bed rest. If the condition does not improve on bed rest, surgical measures may be required. Thanks and take care Chat Doctor.

Patient: If a patient had celiac disease and was also diagnosed with Hashimotos thyroiditis, would treatment be given for both conditions or eliminate gluten etc and wait to see if the thyroiditis is alleviated as research suggests the 2 are connected? kind regards  Doctor: Hi Marie, Welcome to Chat Doctor.

Patient: I had pain in the lower right side of my ( i want to say stomach ) but i feel it is a bit lower, about a month ago, it went away and now it is back, i have been having weird bowel movements and sometimes cannot go at all. When i had intercourse 3 days ago we were in the missionary position when that same spot had a sharp shooting pain through it. It now just feels irritated more than anything except for the occasional sharp pain, and I cannot pass anything at the moment. do you have any ideas?  Doctor: Hello, Lloyd, The location of the pain and some changes in your bowel habits point to some problem with your large intestine or the colon. If you are over 40+ years of age I suspect you may haveDiverticulosis or pockets on the colon wall. This is more common on the left side of the colon although you can involve any part of the bowel. If one of these pockets get infected, then you can have significant pain, fever, chills and even bloody diarrhea. In many cases, this is associated with spasms and the symptoms are similar to IBS or irritable bowel syn Chat Doctor. If you have not had a screening colonoscopy, you should get one. At the minimum, you can get a Barium Enema to see if there are any problems. If you have any family members with history of colon cancer, then you should have the colonoscopy. Same things true if there are any signs of blood in the stool, weight lessor anemia. Have your stool tested for blood and also get a complete blood work. For constipation, you can take stool softeners that arereadilily available in
Patient: HI,my dughter is newborn with spina-bifida meningeocele, she has not had surgery as doctors told she is only six months old. She is crawling nicely and she is starting to get up. She got a small lump on the spine. Can you please advice me when the actual age of operation or surgery for the child would be.  Doctor: Meningomyelocele is grade 2 Arnold Chiara malformation; needs Mr brain and spine to evaluate to what degree your baby is affected; needs completed neurological evaluation of legs and constant check of head circumference. I believe as you said it's just a lump on back may not need surgery now but brain and motor functions are important for assessment.

Ischemia, hypertension, metabolic syn Chat Doctor. Symptoms include : dyspnea, palpitations, easy navigability.echocardiogram and other imaging investigations is crucial to diagnose and know the etiology of the case. I suggest my patients the following : exposure to certain chemicals at work, especially in shipyards, for a long time is risk factor to many occupational diseases, like lung fibrosis, asbestos related lung diseases and that alone may lead to heart failure. The information provided by you is not sufficient to provide a good opinion. If someone comes to me with this condition I would ask them about their respiratory functions, also specific data regarding echocardiography.*Conclusion: I suggest you check for respiratory functions, ask your physician about risk of occupational exposure at your work.  If you have any further questions I will be happy to help, If not, you can close the discussion and rate the answer. Wish you good health.
Patient: I am having upper body shakes and was prescribed pms clonazepam and the shakes have stopped. just wondering what causes body shakes? the doc on call at the hospital did not know and called a neurlogist and she said try these pills? and maybe its dystonia ..............I had been under some stress and a week before the shakes was dizzy and walking to the right or should i say staggering......they first thought it was innner ear infection , my blood work was fine, ekg fine and ct scan fine...........  Doctor: Hello. Thanks for writing to us. The shakes which have subsided on taking clonazepam are likely to be due to anxiety.

Patient: I have been trying to conceive for nine months. Md gave me 50 mg of clomid to make me ovulate earlier because I was ovulating late in my cycle. On clomid I didnt get an lh surge when I tested. Now on day 43 of my cycle with 2 negative pregnancy tests. Was given norethindrone to start my period. Ive taken it for seven days with no results. How soon should I expect it to start?  Doctor: Dear user, welcome to Chat Doctor. We expect menstruation from 2-7 days after the injection. So if seven days have passed, you should try something else. I suggest using Oral tablets containing norethisterone in a dose of 10-20 mg per day for five days and wait for with Chat Doctor. Anyway, we should search for the endocrinological abnormality causing this by having these tests done at day 2 menstruation:FSH, LH, TSH, E2 and prolactin. I hope these words were useful, and I wish you good luck.
Patient: Hi my name is Lm,a, my brother suffered from H1N1 and ARDS, he is now admitted in ICU , isolated, sedated and ventilated, he is on antibiotics and tamiflu ,today is day 23 with stable condition, his saturation between 91-95 %,  the doctors advised to do tracheostomy, my question is : when his condition will be better, the tracheostomy can be removed? Then he can breath normally ? For how long they will keep him on ventilation?Thanks a lot for this benefit site ..  Doctor: Hello and thank you for asking Chat Doctor, I understand your concern, but everything depends on if you have a temporary tracheostomy or permanent. If its temporary than the tube should be able to be removed when you are able to breathe, protect your airway and clear fluids unaided. It is hard to say how long your son will be on ventilation without knowing his condition. But here are some conditions in which you can expect removal: Patient is alert and oriented and responsive to commands, patient is no longer dependent on a ventilator for assisted breathing, the frequency requirement for tracheal suctioning is less than once a day. But everything depends on his condition and judgement of his doctor. I hope this answer was helpful to you.
Patient: Hi there, 5 days ago, Ive noticed a rash on the back of my thigh, very itchy, so I put sudo cream, didnt do anything, I put betadine, no changes. So I put apple cider vinegar on Sunday. Monday morning, it turned into blister with black dots and pus filled, so I thought that works. Been doing it tha last 3days, an still racking my brain what could it be or where I got it from.

Patient: Please tell me the qualities of James Keeney, MD - primarily hip replacement success. His success and failures if any. Does he have a good rep in the orthopaedic field? What about redoing a hip replacement that may have gone wrong and patient in same pain after surgery? What about the fact the patient takes Nardil (Phenolzine) 6 15mg a day - any complications there? What is his recovering time for hip replacement? What if both hips are painful and in a bone on bone situation? Can they be done at same time? What kind of pain medication is used after? Thank you for your help. Judith  Doctor: The usual time for recovery-both in semi arthroplasty Or Total hip replacement(THR) in my unit is 10-15 days after the operation is done.

They have to avoid uneven ground & danger areas to walk.Post-operative life is usually pain less. Patients usually need medicines for other associated diseases. Bilateral THR Can be undertaken in the same session, if strongly indicated. I do not know James Keenan at all, so I can't comment about him.
Patient: Hello Doctor, my daughter is serverly disabled and had a urethrenoscopy procedure on the 2nd may they removed a large stone from her renal pelvis but left 2 still in her kidney as it was too risky to remove them, she is not a good candidate for a PNCL so there isnt anything else they can do. The problem is everytime she urinates she is in excruciating pain where her body literally contorts and its causing her seizures to increase, she is on a constant high dose of morphine to no avail and now her palliative care doctor is prescribing ketamine and gabapentin. But I want some answers as to why she is in so much pain and not just masking over it with more drugs as she wasnt like this before the procedure ? Many thanks  Doctor: Hi thanks for your question. Your daughter is having kidney stone and biggest one removed through ureteroscope. The increase in pain after procedure could be due to small pieces of stones which broke from main big stone while removing or big stone is crushed to make it into small pieces so that it can be easily removed. These small left over pieces of stone try to pass out with urine and cause sever colicky pain. Colicky pain is always very sever, and it is due to obstruction of hollow viscus. She might be getting sever colicky pain when these small pieces of stone pass through with urine. The treatment she is receiving is right. She has to be on higher doses of strong painkiller like morphine or ketamine. Once all leftover pieces of stone pass away with urine she will have relief from pain. Advise her to take plenty of water.Re-consultation with urologist is advisable. Hope this answers your question.

Then you should take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health.

I completely black out, close to passing out, I have to completely stop and wait until it passes as I cannot see a thing and my legs get weak.. Some of the time for about 10 seconds as it s easing and stopping I have troubles remembering where I am or what I was doing ... I do also have troubles breathing sometimes that I have been advised is due to anxiety... Which causes me to feel as though I have a tight chest So I am constantly trying to take deep heavy breaths..which also may affect the dizziness, because of too much oxygen going to my head? A lot of Mosquitos live around my house and obviously they all find their way into my house, do any of these symptoms indicate the Ross River Virus?? Help!  Doctor: Hello dear,First, please do not get concerned with Ross River Virus disease, it presents with a lot of different symptomatology. The symptoms as mentioned in your post can be attributed to pathology in the Vestibular Apparatus in inner ear (it is associated with maintenance of body posture & balance) most probably Labyrinthine or Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo. Symptomatic relief can be obtained with intake of Vestibular sedatives like Betahistine or Linearizing preparations (to be taken only under the guidance of a Physician). So, kindly consult your Physician/ ENT Specialist & get a complete clinical examination done. Investigations like complete blood count, estimation of serum electrolytes & vestibular function tests will be required to rule out any pathological cause for the symptoms. There is no need to worry, you will be fine. Till then, maintain adequate HY Chat Doctor. And also take precautions like getting up from bed slowly & avoid sudden head movements. Wishing you a Good Health. Take care.
Patient: Hi ...i am 21 years old female and i was infected with TB  14 years ago when i was at 7 years old and i was treated completly,regularly and successfuly within months .I remembered... i was suffered for some symptoms like (bloody sputum, reddish orange urine, weight loss, night sweat).Is change of  urine color mean the Disseminated TB to kidney??Is it cause infertility??Now If I do tuberculin skin test become positive or not?? I was vaccinated with BCG when i was baby because i am from KSA.Is there any possibility of return to active TB when my immunity suppressed?? Is the bacilli completly killed with treatment??  Doctor: HiT hanks for your query. I appreciate your concern for the after effects of TB. Here are the answers for your query:1. Orange red discoloration of the urine was the side effect of one of the Chat Doctor. 2. Tuberculin test if done now may show a positive reaction indicating the past infection or BCG vaccination.3. TB may occur if you are exposed to an open case of TB or if your immunity is suppressed.4. Yes the bacilli are killed during the course of treatment if taken properly. However, infertility may occur if it affects the fallopian tube (salpingitis). Hope I could answer your queries. Rate this answer, if you are convinced.
Patient: I just had a CXR in which the radiologist identified 2 possible adhesions, but also stated that they are rounded on the frontal view and therefore cannnot rule out neoplasm.  They want a comparison CXR but I dont have one.  Any advice? How do you differentiate the 2??  Doctor: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Honestly speaking, one can not diagnose neoplasm (cancer) or adhesion only on the basis of chest x-ray. Chest x-ray is giving only Two dimensional (2D) picture of any lesion. It is only screening test for lung lesion. For confirmation, you need CT scan. CT will give you three dimensional (3D) picture. CT will also tell you about exact size, shape and margins of lesion, association with surrounding lung, necrotic center or not, mediastinal lymph node enlarged or not etc. All these things are important in differentiating between neoplasm (cancer) and adhesion (benign lesion). So better to consult pulmonologist and get done CT scan and discuss all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.
Patient: Two days ago i was running with a dog while I was running the dog ran in front of my and triped me. I fell onto the road and skidded. I got some scratches on my face. But about 30 minutes ago my wrist started to hurt. It hurts to twist it did i break it?  Doctor: If you fractured your wrist, it should be deformed, swollen and terribly painful (in this case go take a X-ray). Most likely, you sprained wrist ligaments or the triangular cartilage (a meniscus-like structure of the wrist). Ice rest wrapping and local NSAIDs. If it doesn't pass in 15 days, take a wrist RMN to better understand the damaged structure and plain a possible surgical repair

Patient: My doctor has changed amlodepine to cilacar. Does it help in reducing micro protein urea. I aBlood pressure and diabetic patient for the last 25 years. My microprotineurea urea is 700 againstNormal value of 30 moe or less. Kindly answer.Ashok aggarwal  Doctor: HI Thanks for posting your query.

Elevated Serum Creatinine levels and elevated Serum Potassium levels are contra-indications for the above-mentioned Chat Doctor.  Kindly ask your doctor to test these before starting medications.
Patient: hi ,i am 28 yr female.i am suffering from psoriasis from more than last 15 yrs. already hve tried all the forms of medicines like ayurveda ,homeopathy ,& allopathy out of which homeopathy lead to severe flaring up of disease.plz tell if i ever be able to get rid of this disease,.right now i have this disease in both of my soles & on leg also.plz suggest me the best possible treatment for psoriasis in delhi.  Doctor: Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor I can understand your concern and frustration regarding the chronicity of psoriasis. Psoriasis has a chronic course, the course being fluctuated by remissions and relapses, however there is no permanent cure for psoriasis. Psoriasis is characterized by the presence of well-defined, thick scaly plaques mainly involving the scalp, and extensor surfaces like hands, feet/soles, elbow, knee, lower back etc. Specific topical treatment options for psoriasis plaques affecting the soles and legs includes potent topical steroid, either plain or in combination with salicylic acid. Topical vitamin D analogues like calcitriol, calcipotriene etc. are also effective for localized plaque psoriasis affecting the soles and legs. Oral agents include Immunosuppressive like methotrexate, Oral retinoids(Accretion). Although they are mainly indicated for widespread disease involvement, however, they can be used for limited yet disabling disease involving the palms and soles. Biologics like Infliximab, Golimumab, Evanescent are newer remedies and includes monoclonal antibodies, interleukin, interferons and colony stimulating factors etc. Treatment depends on the severity of the disease. While limited disease can be managed with just topical, widespread or extensive disease may require hospitalization. I would suggest that you seek an appointment with a dermatologist in your vicinity, who would be able to assess the severity of your disease and advice accordingly. Hope this helpsRegards

Patient: Hello, I am 29 yrs. old boy, My hight is 5 5 , weight 57 k.g.. I have a problem related to my semen, before some time as 3 months before whenever i masterbate the ejacuted semen was white, thick and and excess of quantity, but now when i masterbate, the semen is not as white as before it contains some transparency, and also thinner, but ejacuted quantity has increased. What happend to the colour and thickness to my semen. Please help me!  Doctor: helloThanks for query. Based on your statement your semen has become thinner and less viscous compared to what it was their months before This could happen due to following reasons 1)The quantity of sperms which is the main constituent of semen and responsible for viscosity is low 2) Excessive secretion of mucus by Bulb Urethral glands located in Urethra due to masturbation being prolonged for a long time .3) Frequent masturbation over a short period of time. You need to do Semen analysis with abstinence of 4 days prior to collecting semen sample and same should be given for analysis within half an hour after collection. Following measure will help you to improve quality of semen 1) Practice regular exercise for 45 minutes followed by meditation for 1/2 an hour in the morning. 2) Take high protein diet rich in vegetables and fruits and vitamin A, C,D, E.and Zinc 3)Take anti oxidants like Almonds 5-6 everyday4) Avoid alcohol and smoking.

Patient: I am a psychology trainee and was required to complete a PPD skin test to start working at my neuropsychology practicum site. I tested positive and I am worried that I will not be able to work at my practicum site.  I have had an active respiratory infection, but the symptoms do not seem to be typical of TB from what I have read: (a) runny nose; (b) sneezing; (c) fatigue; (d) headache and other cold like symptoms.  I recently had a stent at the hospital for occipital neuralgia and received 1,000 mg of IV steroids and I am worried that my immune system is compromised.  I also have a spinal cord injury and CRPS II, so my body is taxed by pain and pharmacotherapies.  Should I be worried?  Doctor: Hello thanks for posting here. Stenting itself won't cause immune deficit, but high dose steroids can decrease immunity, and you may contract infections. PPD test is positive, so there is a suspicion of TB and not a confirmatory diagnosis. It can come false positive also in many cases. So you have to get evaluated. If you have no symptoms like cough, fever, weight loss the probability of TB is less likely. Since you have got symptoms of active respiratory infection, you must get yourselves checked up. Anyway please do a chest x-ray and give your sputum (if you are producing any) for testing. Wishing you good healthRegards.

I have read your query & understood your problem.  You seem to have allergic problem leading to bronchitis. * Antibiotics in 2nd months monthly intake of antibiotics when prescribed by a doctor knowing about your pregnancy, is not likely to cause direct effect on fetal development except for staining of teeth sometimes. But, the antibiotics are likely to cause B complex deficiency in yourself. Which would in turn cause loss of taste & less eating . Weakness& this may indirectly affect your baby.  Anti-allergic pills taken for a long period is not indicated in early pregnancy (before 3 months) Intravenous injections of antibiotics (permissible in pregnancy)/ bronchodilators do not affect fetal growth.  * Better way to manage your problem is to have consultation of a chest physician & start preventive measures for it. Inform the doctor about your pregnancy & then start with inhalers / medicines. Syrup, pills as per his expert advise.  Thanks.

Patient: For about 3 weeks I have had a severe ache on my right side at my waist. The waistband of clothing causes greater discomfort. Ice helps temporarily, so does heat; Aleve has no affect.

Patient: I went through surgery on Tuesday to get all four of my wisdom teeth out. I ve felt nauseous and dizzy. Yesterday I vomited twice and my stomach is feeling that queezy feeling again. I am now off all my pain medication except an IB pro every 4 hours. I ve been eating each time I swallow the pill . What am I doing wrong and how can I stop the nauseous feeling?  Doctor: Hello, After extraction of wisdom teeth, it takes 7 to 10 days usually for the extraction socket to heal and close completely provided if there is no infection. During the healing process you there is increased salivary secretion and due to stimulation of antibiotics and analgesics you may experience the feeling on nausea and vomiting. Few antibiotics increase acid Redux in the body which leads to dizziness so don't worry as it is a secondary reaction. To get rid of nausea and vomiting start with antacid tablets twice daily before meals. Use antiseptic mouthwash like chlorhexidine for mouth rinsing which prevents infection, refuses salivation and gives soothing effect. I hope this helps, Take care.

Patient: i found a lump under my right breast... and sense I found the lump.. just last sunday it has gotten bigger.. I had a mammogram and a ultra done and they want to send me for a biopsy next monday.. it started out as just a irritant but has grown into a achy pain.. I get shortness of breath and at times half of my right arm will go num.. can that lump press on my lung causing my shortness of breath and why is my arm going num.. plus what can I do to ease the pain.. I got inflamatory med. but cant take it till after biopsy due to its a blood thinner..just taking tylonal right now..  Doctor: Hi. Thanks for your query and an elucidated history. The lump in the breast has to be biopsied, and you have an appointment for it. It is very rare to have the lump to grow into the lungs, so practically impossible for the lump to cause the shortness of breath. There may be a problem in the lung only. The numbness in the right arm can have a reason in the neck or the cervical spine. Form the history you have provided, I would suggest you to go for MRI of the cervical spine and neck soft tissue to watch for either the disc or secondary lymph node. So also to go for CT scan Chest for condition of the lung/ lump and possibility of cancer and its complications. It is not for sure that this is cancer only, but you have to get this ruled out and get a proper treatment at the earliest.

They dont hurt and I didnt even know they were there. The dentist didnt really say anything about them. Is this anything I need to address?

Observe them to rule out is there any change in shape or no. If indicated a biopsy of the area is simple. Ventral area of tongue is not a common site for oral cancer though.

Patient: Dear Doctor, We are trying to have a baby and gave it a big try this time but as we are planning to go for an Invitro (ICSI) for the next period, my doctor gave me Primolut Not from day 16 to day 25. I am wondering if this will have a negative impact on my pregnancy if I am pregnant because as explained we gave it a big try this time. Thank you in advance for your response. With my Best Regards; Mme Sue  Doctor: Hellos you are going in for CSI next month, your doctor has given you Primal N for regulating the cycles. However, in case you have conceived this month, it is not advisable to take Primal N, as it causes virilization of female fetus and other abnormalities in the baby.

Patient: I noticed Sunday, 2/2/14 that my 7yr old Daughters ring toe and pinky toe on her right foot were swollen. She has fingers for toes, long and skinny and they were both swelled up like sausages. I could not find any bruising, she can bend them, she doesn t remember hitting them on anything, but she does say it hurts when she bends them and when I push on them. I gave her some Motrin hoping that it would reduce the swelling. Monday, they were still swollen, so I tried giving her Benadryl to see if that would reduce the swelling, thinking maybe it s something allergy related. Tuesday, the pinky toe is not swollen anymore, but the ring toe is still fat. Still no bruising, but she still says it hurts when I touch it. I am at a loss on what it could be or why its not going away. I don t know if something bit her, or did she stub it? I don t know what I should do. Do I take her to have it checked out or give it more time? This is now day 4.  Doctor: Hi. My opinion is that it should be checked to exclude insect bites, allergy, Fungal infections or even trauma. Even if she does not recall bumping her foot, it is possible she did and sustained a ligament injury, especially as it is sore when touched. Rather let your doctor have a look. Hope this helps.
Patient: I am a 24 year old female, i started taking biotin supplements 1000micrograms every other day after prolonged use of antibiotics (4 years every 3 months or so) for chronic UTI caused by genetics and issues with pelvic floor muscles. I was also on Nortrel 7/7/7 birth control during this time. I stopped taking birth control in November of 2012 and I am no longer suffering anxiety, extreme mood swings, depression, and my weight is slowly dropping  currently 245 lbs(1st yr on birth control I gained 80 lbs with no change in diet and I was active into yoga and ballet before, also I am 6ft tall i walk several times a day still and wear a US size 16) I have missed my last 2 periods with multiple negative pregnancy tests (coincided with biotin use) is this something I need to get checked out or should I simply stop taking the vitamins?  Doctor: 1. long term use of birth control pills results in reduced absorption of B-Complex Vitamins and thus Biotin is prescribed by the Physician/Doctor for the same.2. Biotin has nothing to do with the periods, because this is all in the brain which sends hormones to the Female Reproductive system, and birth control pills disrupt this circuit leading to high or low levels of hormone related with ovulation.3. US FDA has laid guidelines on its consumption, because excess will cause harm like: excess growth of hairs and nails, in experimental mice it has shown to cause miscarriages, although this has not been proven in pregnant women.4. For the Pregnancy test: It should be taken 10 days after the missed period, during which Chat Doctor is excreted.5. Consult with your Gynecologist for any further Clarification.
Patient: I recently ran an ultramarathon and had compression short on during the run.  They were tied and the knot was tucked inside.

Patient: Hi, I have been suffering from random symptoms, my doctor said it was narcolepsy , but they say its genetic , no one on my family has ever had that disorder. and there are other symptoms my symptoms are: -night terrors -to fall asleep randomly -lose feeling in my limbs like they are sleeping -gets those catatonic attacks where I don t move or speak or even blink -to fall asleep its within minutes sometimes seconds, when I finally does get to sleep its very deep or not deep at all but no matter which I wakes up after all my dreams -coughing Blood -fating -can t breath -my vision blur -pressure on my chest  Doctor: Hi there, Thanks for your query. Firstly, coughing out blood should be investigated at the earliest : it can be due to either a lung infection, such as tuberculosis, lung abscess etc.; recurrent pulmonary embolisms; or, due to heart failure during sleep (called nocturnal dyspnea) as part of impending heart failure. Hence, get a thorough cardiac and lungs evaluation done AT THE EARLIEST. The possible causes of sudden sleep, night terrors, transient numbness of limbs and catatonic attacks are:- either a type of epilepsy (called Absence seizures in Adults) or; constant anxiety with acute Panic reactions. An MRI of brain + EEG should be done at the earliest. If both : MRI and EEG reports are normal, a regular course of antianxiety+ anti-depressant Chat Doctor.  Consult your doctor and apprise him of my opinion. I am certain that he will agree with me, order required tests, and-based on the reports-will prescribe suitable/modified treatment as advised.

Patient: I had cabg surgery 2 years ago . Several months after the surgery I started having severe substernal pain which was diagnosed as being caused by nerve damage during the surgery. It was controlled fairly well by medication until the last few months . Can anything be done to block this nerve from making me hurt ?  Doctor: Hithis is post-operative sternal incision scar pain caused due to incomplete injury to the nerves which keep on firing on & off. But then blocking these nerve endings is quite difficult as all the major organs are situated in this area. Please apply some local anesthetic gels containing lidocaine(which is quite safe), added with topical painkiller gels(like diclofenac), or simple moisturizing creams will also help sometimes. Just try to ignore the pain. All the best take care
Patient: I recently had elevated liver results and so they tested for Hepitis and that was normal... EKG also adnormal and said something about doing a 24 hr holter monitor . This is the third time both test were abnormal and my regular doctor always stops after doing the same test. I m 32 5 3 215lbs. I have had normous health issues throughout life. I had Hasimotos and thyroid was removed but those test were normal. Just wondering what should I do to get past the routine of doing the same test and getting no answers.  Doctor: Hello, First there are many causes of elevated liver enzymes. I suppose you were tested for one of the most common ones which are the viral hepatitis (Hepatitis B and hepatitis C). The fact that you had Hashimoto thyroiditis, which is an autoimmune disease (where your body attacks itself), is a risk factor for having concurrent Autoimmune Hepatitis. This can be tested by blood tests (ANA, AMA, ASIA, etc.), but may require a liver biopsy. Other causes considering: alcohol intake, iron overload, medication induced hepatitis, fatty liver (common in diabetics, overweight people). If no answer is obtained with lab work and ultrasound of the liver then I would recommend you going for the liver biopsy.
Patient: Hi. Why do I feel spaced out, numb, or high when I look up to the left, forward or turn my neck? My tongue feels numb when this happens. I get sharp right side of face pain, eye pain. I have joint pain, trouble walking. I also get spine pain, middle pain and weakness. I have infections a lot. Uti s. Swollen glands. Inflammation in right eyes needing steroid. Neuropathy. Bad muscle cramping in legs and even torso. Balance and coordination issues. A poor neuro psych eval in info processing - cognitive decline, fluid buildup in body with mottled skin swollen lymph nodes maybe due to constant infections. Dr s agree low immune system high inflammation.  Doctor: The reason could be sever spondylosis with osteophytes blocking your vertebra basilar artery that supply your head and brain with blood also osteophytes could cause all your other neuropathy symptoms I suggest doing a CT scan on cervical vertebra to confirm I hope i my advice will be of much help Good Luck :)
Patient: I m about 18 weeks pregnant. I recenty had a amniocentesis in which the chromosomes results showed extra material on the chromosome 4. My husband and I had to give blood, the doctors said is either one of us carrier the trait it would be considered inherited from the parents. If neither one of us show the trait, should I be concered, and what health condition (disorders) could my baby have?  Doctor: Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor. I am assuming that by "extra material in chromosome 4" you mean trisomy of chromosome 4. Please clarify it from your doctor. Trisomy chromosome 4 is a rare disorder. The baby may have structural deformity, cardiac malformations and mental retardation of varying degrees. If you and your partner both are carriers then chances of recurrence in future pregnancy is higher.in my opinion you should discuss this matter with your doctor about the possible effects to the fetus and decide prudently. Please write back if you have any more questions.
Patient: Sir, I have facial problem. It is diagnosed as hemifacial spasm . Is t paralysis? Your treatment with medicine or massage therapy? Pls reply to follow. Varadharajan R, madurai.  Doctor: Hello Varadharajan, Bifacial Spasm involves involuntary contractions of muscles of one side of face. It usually begins around the eyes and can later involve other muscles supplied by the facial nerve. It's usually seen on one side only, although it can occur on both sides of face. These movements cannot be voluntarily suppressed like in a condition called Tics and can continue even in sleep. It is thought to be due to blood vessel pressing on the facial nerve, although it can be due to other causes also. It is not paralysis like you fear. Effective treatment is taking Botulinum toxin injections or doing microvascular decompression surgery if there is pressure on the facial nerve as earlier mentioned. It is possible to maintain reasonable control over the movements with treatment. Hope this helps!
Patient: Hi, I would like to enquirer about pressure pain in my right arm, and I feel it is related to my fast heart rate when I wake in the morning.  I am under a lot of stress at the moment.  I went to the Dr yesterday, he did not give me any blood pressure test nothing just said it could be anxiety.  Please could you tell me what you feel this is?  Doctor: Hello and, Fast heart rate is caused most commonly due to anxiety. The other causes include hypertension (raised blood pressure) and heart diseases. Since, your blood pressure is within normal limits, the possibility of hypertension is ruled out. To rule out heart ailments you need to get examination of your cardiovascular system. An ECG will determine any problem of the heart. However, if all the investigations turn out to be normal, anxiety is the most common cause. Pain in the right arm can also be associated with the spells of anxiety. Management of anxiety is primarily behavioral and social. You need to find out the cause of anxiety. Once the cause of anxiety is found out, you need to manage it with support of family and friends. Thanks and take care Chat Doctor.

Doctor: Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor, Anemia is caused by a number of causes. A low hemoglobin gives us the information that hemoglobin is low, but the cause has to be found. The first thing to do is to get a peripheral blood film examination and red blood indices. This investigation will let the doctor know about the status of red blood cells and the indices. Further investigations will be guided by the result of these investigations. Management of anemia will depend on the result of these investigations. Anemia can be due to loss of blood, nutritional deficiency, hemoglobin disorders, etc. After knowing the cause treatment can be planned. Thanks and take care Chat Doctor.

Maintaining hygiene is also an important part as it can also treat you equally other antibiotics do. You can ask for further queries here on bit.ly/
Patient: Hi, about a 1 1/2 ago I underwent a major surgery to repair my bile duct strictures, I had suffered from pancreatis from the time the took my gall bladdar until this surgery (1o years), they perfomed a roux en y (not gastric).  I now suffer from severe kidney stones, is this a side effect/result of the suregery preformed?  I had never experienced anything like this before.  They are very painful and mimick the pain of pancreatits.  Doctor: Hi, Thanks for writing in. There are three problems to be discussed in you.1. History of pancreatitis ?following gall bladder surgery.2. Major surgery to repair bile duct strictures.3. Present problem with renal (kidney) stones. From your history, it is unlikely that kidney stones have developed from the earlier pancreatitis or biliary stricture problems. Since you have a history of pancreatitis, I suggest you also talk to your gastroenterologist and get your pancreas enzymes (lipase) evaluated. If raised, changes of chronic pancreatitis must be looked for through ultrasound scan or CT scan of abdomen. Your kidney stones will cause pain along sides of abdomen and radiating to pelvis, sometimes causing pain in testis if you are male. Hope this helps.
Patient: Husband had severe chest pain yesterday. Drove himself to ER. Labs, EKG and x ray all normal. Follow up with GP In the morning. Had more chest pain in the adternoon yesterday that lasted about 20 minutes. Today on and off nausea as well as dizziness. Should we return to ER right away? Or see GP in the morning?  Doctor: Thank you for posting your query. I can understand your concern. In any case of acute chest the worst possibility is acute myocardial infarction or A.M.I (heart attack) which in your case has been hopefully ruled out by the EKG's and Lab tests. Now, 42% of the chest pains without Myocardial infarction occurs due to gastroesophageal causes like gastritis, gallstone. Other causes like inflammation of the covering of heart 9pericarditis), pneumonia (infection of lung), a bulging of the wall of a great vessel called aorta (aortic aneurysm) can also cause chest discomfort. Look for alarming symptoms like chest pain radiating to the left arm, sweating ; in that case immediately take him to the E.R.I would suggest you to give him a combination of Pantoprazole 40 mg and Risperidone 30 mg every morning in an empty stomach for 10 days. I would also suggest you to take him to a cardiologist, who can correlate the labs and EKG clinically. Hope this helps. Post any other question. We will be happy to help. Have a nice day. Regards.
Patient: Hello, I was wondering about Dementia Pugilistica. I am wondering about my nephew. He is 17 now and has had alot of concussions from hard blows to his head in football. The last 2yrs hes been acting stranger and stranger. Then he had a truck accident and hit his head again. Is demenor got even worst with memory problems, blackouts with major aggression. He wouldn t listen and played football anyway and started drinking acohol for the heaches. Now he s in trouble big and he doesn t remember if he done what there accusing him of..At first I thought he was lying now I think he really does have issue of the brain. What are the symptoms and how do I find a doctor to check him and help him if he does..Live in Arkansas.. Thanks --Confused Sorry didn t know you had to pay I haven t work in 6 yrs do to muscle spasms in my body that no one can figure out the cause b/c test keep comming back normal.. They still hurt though.. Thank You for your time anyway. Sorry...  Doctor: Hello Thanks for askingDementia Pugilistic also called as chronic traumatic encephalopathy is a type of dementia that occur in boxers after repeated trauma on head. The main clinical features are declining memory and features of Parkinson's disease like tremors and a number of other symptoms. He is having forgetfulness but no other symptoms are there that can label him with dementia pugilistic. Multiple trauma to head and then one serious accident are most likely the reason for his personality change. He is acting stranger, have problems of aggression, don't listen anyone and has started taking alcohol. He is not remembering the episode of aggression. Such symptoms may occur some time following head trauma because of injury to frontal and temporal lobe of brain. Injury to brain may cause personality changes and may aggravate anti-social behavior. Loss of short term memory might be due to trauma only. I would advise you to consult a good Psychiatrist for his treatment. To decrease his aggression and post-traumatic complications medicines like Mood Stabilizers like Sodium Valproate, Carbamazepine etc. can be used. Hope this helps you, thanks
Patient: I have been suffering from recurrent UTI (3 times in two months). Each time, my diagnosis report shows high TLC (24000) and ESR (40-50) alongwith E Coli (>10^5). I have taken a lot of antiboitics but after 15 days UTI comea back again. Please advice me if I need to do something at my home.  Doctor: Thank you for the query. I would like to know your age, gender and whether you suffer from any associated comorbidities like Diabetes mellitus. I would also like to know what group of antibiotics were taken by you. As per the history, you are suffering from recurrent Urinary Tract Infection, with raised infection parameters (TLC-24000/mm3 and ESR-40). Recurrent UTI can occur due to a number of different causes in males and females. Uncontrolled Diabetes is an important cause for both genders, hence it is advisable to get your blood sugar screened (fasting and post radial blood sugar). In elderly male patients prostatomegaly is an important cause, which can lead to recurrent UTI. In elderly female subjects, bladder neck obstruction (mainly age related) can cause raised residual urinary volume, which can again lead to recurrent UTI. An ultrasonography of kidney-ureter-bladder with assessment of residual urinary volume helps in this case. Inadequate antibiotic dosage for inadequate duration is another important cause of recurrent UTI. This can lead to emergence of Chat Doctor.  A urine for routine examination and culture is needed (though in all probabilities your culture may be negative since you have received multiple courses of antibiotics). I would advise you to consult your physician since you need a thorough check-up and some specific investigations, as your infection parameters are raised (an intravenous course of high-end antibiotics may well be required after assessment). It will be slightly difficult to manage your case at home, since you are not responding to oral antibiotics. Personal hygiene is very important for prevention of UTI (keep your private areas clean and

SHE OFTEN HAS A VERY STRONG ODER THAT SHE LEAVES ON ME AFTER SEX THANK YOU  Doctor: Hi, You should rule out acute urethritis or infection of genital organs like seminal vesicle or epididymis infection of the present. I suggest you investigate with urine routine microscopic examination and semen analysis to guide you further.  If these come normally than no need to worry. Meanwhile, Chat Doctor.  You can consult a urologist for the examination.  Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.
Patient: I am 19 year old male. on friday night I was drinking at a party and later on went in a hot tub for a while, I was pretty intoxicated at the time. that morning I woke up and my left nipple was slightly swollen and hurt to touch. It feels like it has a lump underneath. by sunday it had swollen up a tiny bit more and throbs occasionally. my armpit also feels like it has a pea sized lump in it that hurts when i press my arm to my side. it is now monday and nothing has changed. the lump is not directly under the pointy part of the nipple but about a centimetre off. when i squeezed my nipple there was a very small amount of clear/milky discharge that cam out, but from the side not the tip of the nipple.  Doctor: HelloThanks for your query, based on the facts that you have posted it appears that you have tender nipple with enlarged lymph node in axial. This could be a primary infection of a nipple or staphylococcal infection of a hair follicle (Boil) near nipple. You need to take broad spectrum antibiotic like Čeferin along with anti-inflammatory Chat Doctor. Do not worry this will get cured within a week.
Patient: Hello. I have had tongue ulcers for over 1 year and 8 months now. They are continuous and located on the edges of my tongue. They range from pin prick size to dime size. The big ones leave deep holes in my tongue once they heal. I also get vaginal ulcers to the point they scarred the area and have eaten away my urethra. My eyes swell and get bloody sometimes. And about 1 year after those symptoms appeared I started to get large painful bumps under my skin that created bruises. These bruise bumps leave a divot after they heal. At the same time as this I started to get blister sores almost pimple like on my skin to the point that if they gather in patches the skin is raw to and purple red. These leave permanent purple red marks when healed. My elbows also started the last 4 months to get hot and hurt a lot. All of these symptoms get worse in the cold months. Odd but I have not actually gotten a cold or flue since this began. I have never been sexually active. Please help me figure out what I have.  Doctor: Good day, and thanks for your question. From what you said, it usually gets worse during cold seasons. You could be having a moderate - severe form of Cold Urticaria. Kindly see your dermatologist and know your HIV status (it's not only through sex you can contact HIV). Hope it helps. Thank you.
Patient: I have had a laparoscopic cholecystectomy procedure 7 months ago. I was in pain 5 years before it was decided to remove my gall bladder and from the day of surgery to present I am in constant pain in the right side of my abdomen radiating into mg back. I have been told I have post cholecystectomy syndrome and told there is nothing that can be done for my pain. I was offered an exploratory ercp but I am absolutely petrified of having this done unless under a general which was not offered. I have had other procedures previously with sedation and have fully remembered the experiences which have now contributed to my white coat syndrome and sheer panicking Wight regards to procedures. Can u please tell me ice a general anaesthetic could be used and any types of pain relief which may help. Even tramadol does not ease my discomfort.  Doctor: Hi friend, Welcome to Chat Doctor Take care - a vicious cycle of pain and analgesics may end up in addiction... Anesthesia is generally avoided in the procedure.  The doctor needs to monitor the patients' response to assess the success, to avoid injury and so on. You may try CT scan - it can often clarify the situation. Keep following up - with GASTROENTEROLOGIST Wishing speedy recovery God bless Good luck
Patient: I have a small pea sized lump just below my left clavicle which has been there for 6 weeks now. In the last few weeks another lump has appeared on my back at the top of my shoulder. I have been suffering with unexplained back pain since may last year and am being treated for chronic pain. I have started to notice things but they are happening but not all the time these include itchiness on my lower legs, profuse sweatingat night, sharp needling pains in the lump near my collarbone. I have been to my doctor and he says they are fatty lumps but he also said i had mechanical back pain that would get better within a few weeks and here we are 8 months later and i am no better and feeling like no one cares so i am no longer confident in his diagnosis. Can you help?  Doctor: Hi. Thanks for your query. Noted your history of pain in the back for one year and not getting resolved in spite of the treatment, and selling below the clavicle and the shoulder as you have mentioned. In my opinion, when you are suffering for such a long and not getting healed up, it is the best way to consult a Specialist and get clinical evaluation and investigations like MRI done. The swelling too needs ultrasonography and FNAC to see whether this is lipoma, sebaceous cyst or lymph node or something else and the best way is to get it operated for 2 reasons.1. You get the disease out of the body and 2. You get the confirmed histopathological diagnosis and certain for the reasons and get further treatment as required.

You may try to take as much bed rest as possible lying in most comfortable posture that relaxes and eases pain. Do hot fomentation, avoid bending and lifting objects and take meds as prescribed. There is a lumbosacral brace for lower back which you may wear for support. In 3-5 days you may recover

This year his chest seems to be worse than ever how do I recognise if pneumonia is starting again what can I do ? .He s not had the flue jab this year .

Sputum routine examination and sputum culture for isolation of causative bacteria. 5. If sputum production is not present than Bronchoscopy and BAD (Bronchi Alveolar Lavage) analysis. So better to consult pulmonologist and discuss all these to diagnose pneumonia in your husband.

Patient: I always feel light headed like Im going to pass out feel like there is pressure in ears and the doctor says there is no ear infection or fluid the vein right behind my ear lubes feel as if it is swelled... One doctor says it could be tmj another says vertigo.... It just started 3 months ago ... I dont feel the room as a spinning affect but more like Im just light headed and going to pass out  Doctor: Hi!welcome to Chat Doctor! Lightheadedness however is a common complaint in people having low blood pressure. When the blood pressure is too low, not enough oxygen-rich blood is being delivered to the brain, and its function can be affected. Low blood pressure may be the result of an underlying illness or disease, or it may be a normal physiologic condition. Some common reasons for low blood pressure include Anemia and deny Chat Doctor. Laryngitis can also cause fullness in ears and lightheadedness, but your doctor has already examined you and said there is no ear infection. Get your blood pressure and hemoglobin checked. Hope this helps you! Take care!
Patient: My daughter had a Cerebral Hematoma while in China, she is in a very good hospital in Shanghai - this happened a week ago, she is in a coma, some of it medically induced. The Drs. are trying to make arrangements to fly her back to Boston. Is it safe to fly after this type of brain bleed.  Doctor: So sorry to hear about that terrible calamity.  Do they know how the hematoma occurred?  Was it traumatic?  Obviously, her delicate state requires a lot of thought and reflection as to how best to transport her.  I wouldn't be able to give you a fair answer unless I knew much more about her current condition as well as the cause.  Are they keeping her induced in order to reduce metabolic needs of the brain or has she been seizing?  It doesn't sound as if they've performed a craniectomy at this point.  Have they evacuated the hematoma?  If she is to be transported immediately then, the Air Evan plane must be capable of transporting an NICU patient of this type which is clearly a risk for such a long flight.  Would it be nonstop? Based on the little information you've provided and if she is truly in a quality institution of care then, I would vote for a more conservative approach and allow her to step down from the ICU before trying to move her that far in an air ambulance.  Too many things can happen on such a long flight that can upset her balance.  If you'd like to discuss this further in the form of a specialty consultation please write to me at: www.bit.ly/ Chat Doctor.

Patient: Two days ago my husband woke up and noticed his entire facial area was puffy.  Although it is less puffy today, it is still noticeable today, it seems to be better.  To add to this, today he has felt some soreness in his upper left abdomen just under the rib cage.  If he applies pressure to the area it is somewhat tender to the touch.  Do the two have anything to do with each other and what may be causing this?  Doctor: Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor. Both Puffiness of face and left upper qua Chat Doctor. Because puffiness of face may be seen in allergies and kidney diseases. Left upper abdominal may be either from heart cause like Heart attack, angina etc. Some other causes are Splenic causes i.e. ruptured spleen, splenic abscess. Kidney causes are renal infection, stones or chronic or acute renal failure etc. Even gastric problem can be a cause. Since the facial puffiness decreases in one or two days most probably allergy or kidney problem could be the cause. Please do an ECG and X-ray chest to rule out Heart and lung disease. We have to do Ultrasound abdomen, blood urea, creatinine, and urinalysis to rule out kidney disease. As tenderness is in left upper qua
Patient: i have question on my look of my chest ,i am doing my gym regularly with my all cardio workouts also.i need to get my chest flat,square and good look.it looks like some fat muscles accumulate under my chest and its not going away.so it gives puffy appearance which i dont like.i checked in internet that for this problem we can take gynexin,gynemax,should i need to consult any doctor before taking this pill.whether this pill directly acts only on chest muscles?or is that purely herbal without side effects?  Doctor: Hi, Based on the history you seem to have developed gynecomastia or fatty breast tissue. You should consult your doctor for proper clinical examination and to determine any underlying cause. Although a number of medications like clonidine, tamoxifen and anastrazole are claimed to be effective however FDA has not approved them for this condition. If enlarged breasts are bothersome your doctor may advise liposuction or mastectomy. Genetic is a herbal formula claimed to be effective in reducing the fat tissue in the chest however its efficacy and safety has not been proved on any clinical trials. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care

Patient: I have been having shortness of breath, and chest pains. I have these like breathing spasms it seems like. I feel as though I can t get in enough air. I have been to the ER near me twice and I have been to the family doctor 3 times plus an ER an hour away. I have hypertrophic nonobstructive cardiomyopathy, I was born with it. I have gotten X-rays and I ve been hooked to machines, I have had an EKG and an Echo but everything was fine, except the EKG was slightly abnormal (could be due to the heart condition) I have also been to see my cardiologist. When I was in the ER they did a breathing test, which didn t help and before the test, I zoned out and my heart rate dropped to 49 and my oxygen went from 95 down to 73 in mere seconds I went back to the family doctor and he said it s anxiety. I have anxiety, yes, but this is NOT anxiety. The feelings are different.  Doctor: Hi, If all the concern tests are normal or unremarkable as long as the symptoms of chest pain and breathing difficulty are there then certain conditions are there and that could be the possible reasons for the symptoms you have apart from the anxiety, first is low hemoglobin and second which is pretty common the hyperacidity.  These two conditions can be treated, get done the hemoglobin test and for hyperacidity, Tab Omeprazole can be tried on a tentative basis, let us hope for the good. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.
Patient: my husband had a chest exray and they said they saw some crystalization in his lungs and want to do a CT scan with contrast. This is very expensive and we dont have insurance. What does this crystalization mean? He is 60 and is a carpenter and has been working with asbestos in the past.  Doctor: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Crystallization of lungs means fibrotic thickening of lungs. This is commonly seen with chronic dust or chemicals orally Fumes exposure. Actually, they all cause inflammation in lungs when inhaled chronically. This continuous inflammation will cause fibrosis and thickening of lung parenchymal. And these will appear as Crystallization on chest x-ray. This kind of diseases are commonly seen with asbestos, silica exposure. Chest x-ray is just a screening tool. We have to go for CT scan to confirm this. So CT scan is mandatory in his case. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your husband. Thanks.
Patient: my husband has atleast stage 3 possibly stage 4a pancreatic cancer ( I say it that way because I do not fully understand the staging and no one will tell us what stage he is) his tumor is located at the head of his pancreas with venous involvement of both the SMV and the portal vein. He has had his gall bladder and appendix taken out as well as having a bowel blockage bypassed and a j tube inserted. He is now experiencing pain every time he eats as well as more frequent bouts of constipation again accompanied by a lot of nausea after eating. I have him on resource 2.0 270 ML at 60ML/hr as well as a low fat, low fiber, low salt diet as tolerated by mouth. He takes Reglan to aid in digestion, as well as Nexium for Barrett s Esophagus and this is supplemented with Zantac once a day (nexium at night, zantac in the morning). He also takes Tramadol for pain, but if the pain gets to be too much he will exchange a dose or two for a dose or two of Oxycodone. What else can we do to ease his pain and constipation? Oh, I forgot... to help aid in the fluid absorbtion in his bowels we use 60 ML 3x a day of water to flush his j tube.  Doctor: Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum.  I am sorry to know his health history. Every step of the treatment is going on good according to the situation.  I may suggest some Chat Doctor. So I advise you to stop the intact, and if necessary you can give him the medium for the second time.  You can give him raglan for 2 or 3 times a day to prevent, the constipation, and for sleep. If there is frequency of stools, you can give it twice, or once only.  Wishing him a pain less, recovery. Thank you.
Patient: I am having right  wrist and hand weakness, gripping issues at times, numbness, tingling, pain and temperature changing...have had a history of injury to hand ..had a De Quervain  surgery and recently have had another injury to my same hand, wrist... all symptoms just in hand and wrist...pain  did somewhat go away after first surgery, but never totally away and pain now is back and recurring more and wakes me during the night with dull achy pain and temperature change  Doctor: It is very possible that you have an associated neck problem. Neck arthritis can put pressure on the upper limb nerves coming from the neck. Differentiation depends on a combination of radiology (MRI of the neck), nerve studies and good examination by an orthopedic or spine surgeon.
Patient: I had a root canal on lower left molar this past Thursday. I have had several root canals and never had a problem. After novacain wore off I  had intense pain unusual I thought but hope it was better in morning. Well that didnt happen I was in excruciating pain most of the night. Continued the next day. Endotonist started me on antibiotic zpac and steroid pac for 7 days. Pockets of huge bubbles of pus formed behind and around the tooth. They have since popped on their own and drained. Pain is better however I cant touch the tooth while eating or I go thru the roof. Puss pockets I think will continue to form. Not sure. Endodontic has not scheduled a follow up. Tells me to go to dentist for the permanent filling. ?? Im confused as soon as I stop antibiotics wont the pain come back? Doesnt it need to be retreated and how soon?  Doctor: Hi, Thanks for posting the query, Pain after root canal treatment could be due to improper technique, reinfection any accidentally left over canal. A thorough checkup and an IOWA x-ray of the region is required. Based upon which a pretreatment can be performed. Take a course of antibiotics and analgesics. Take care!
Patient: Hi. My son (30 months) vomited early Saturday morning (twice, but second time I think was because he had some milk within an hour of being sick). Fine, but tired Saturday and back to normal Sunday. My daughter (4 1/2) was then sick once on Monday evening (quite a lot but one bout only) and complained of sore throat and aches. Was fine Tuesday, gave her plain foods and normal drinks. Today back to normal. This evening both of them have done poo which is solid but pale yellow in colour! Neither are complaining of feeling poorly or having tummy ache and there is no temperature! Is this the stomach bug making its way through their system or another bug? Thank you  Doctor: Hi, I had gone through your question and understand your concerns. The most common cause of pale stool is biliary dyskinetic is a bad passage of the bile ducts. The bile ducts carry bile from the liver and gallbladder through the pancreas to the small intestine. Child Chat Doctor.  It seems he has gastroenteritis, it caused by infection. Try to follow the following guidelines:1. Nitrofurantoin 1 tablet 3 times for 7 days.2. Darolac 1 capsule once a day for 1 month for normal intestinal flora.3. Domstal syrup you can use for prophylaxis of vomiting.4. Charcoal 1 tablet daily for absorption of toxins.5.ORS6. Lozenges-sualin 1 tablet 4 times for sore throat. Start on these remedies and get back to me in 5 to 7 days. Wish your baby good health.

Kindly help me regarding this what should I do to minimize visibilty of viens of my hand??  Doctor: Hello, THX to contact us. I understand your concern. If I am your doctor I advise you that popping up veins has nothing to do with masturbation. It is good sign of visible veins as only a muscular man has visible veins.

Patient: Hello, Im a 26 year old male with a lot of issue down in my left testicul, lower left abdomen and occasionally, inside of my left foot aches sometimes; when my left testical and abdomen aches. History; 18 (years of age); I caught syphillis it was my first STD. at 19 I caught it again in College and was treat. at 23 I caught gonnerhea twice within the same year. I did not wait the full sevens days both time before ejection, and back to sex. Lastly, at 24 i caught Tric.. and thats when things started to change, i didnt wait the 7 days again, and started back having sex with my girlfriend not knowing if we were giving it to each other back and forth. from 23-26 i have properly either masturbating or had sex, twice a day every single day, at one point i went 8 months straight ejectulating. Then one drunken night at 25, i took one of those sex pills u can get at a store, and smoked weed and drunk Hennessy (Cognac), that day. I didnt know what i was doing, and panic, because of performances reason. After that, the aches in the left side of my testicles, and left side of my Permia ( i think thats what its called), the muscle part of your penis that you can feel tighten, when u move ur penis, push urine out faster, and ejaculate. Extreme pain in that area and left testicules started a couple months later, I also started smoking cigarettes shortly during this period, and marijuana ( all which are bad, and may have caused worsen issues). in November 2012, i went to the hospital after walking down the street and had so much pain in my left testicul that i could not walk, and cab to the hospital..(They did an ultrasound, did see anything) They said it could be hydoceles and epdytimitis,.. took some anti-botics, muscle relaxer and told to see urologist,.. went to a urologist, he did an test for hydroceles, and said it wasnt that or epdytimitis, and told me to come back if pain consisted... I seen another doctor for test work. Everything came up negative... I seldom smoked cigarettes when im stressed, and thats when i can predict the pain in my left test,abdomen, and sometimes the inside of my left foot.... My testiculs,penis, and reproductive system just hasnt been the same. My testiculs rarely tighten up to my body like they use to, even during erection, they just hang and hang. My pain continue everything other day, i almost have to live with it, but dont want to.... My health insurance in over, Im waiting now on my universal health-care to start up, to see anybody... The tip of my penis is everything sensitive, and during sex can cause very quick ejaculation.... I dont know what else to do, i dont know if its nerve damage, cancer, or something new that havent been researched. All the research i do leads to options that doctors has already ruled out... so now im confused. I apologize if its to much information; i was trying to be as thorough as possible as Im trying to get over these issues and function properly. Its difficult to work when the pain araises, it can go from 5 to 10 in mere seconds, and my testis just sagging all the time, is scary and im afraid that I am becoming impoted at 26. I need some help?  Doctor: Degree understand your concerns went through your details. In most of the circumstances premature ejaculation is due to performance anxiety.

Patient: I have a rash . It started just on my ankles and is severely itchy. After a while it left my legs and moved farther up my leg. It has continued to do this moving in a very systematic pattern along my body. It is mirrored on either side, like currently it is on both of my wrist , the insides of my upper arms, my inner thighs and just around the sides of my back. When it first started it was only one or two bumps, slightly red much like an irritated hair follicle , at a time and they only lasted in one spot for a couple of days before moving. Now they show up in much larger patches 10-15 at a time and last for a weeks or so before they move. This started back in Nov. I have seen my gp for the problem and he just keeps on prescribing me allergy medicine, so far we have done a topical cream and a rx antihistamine, it was immediately after starting the antihistamine that my rash mutated into larger sites with longer breeding time. I need to stop itching, any thoughts!! I have also spent many hours scouring the interenet for any picture that resembles what I have and I absolutely cannot find anything that matches it. The raised bump is the size of a very small pimple and nearly always the same color as my skin or slightly pink after lots of scratching .  Doctor: Hello there, the description of the rash whicChatDoctores and goes since November may indicate an allergic component. However an infestation of scabies has to be ruled out. Treatment includes an antihistamines, topical moisturizing lotion and if it is scabies a course of permethrin overnight application all over the body below the neck followed by washing off the next day will be enough.

Everything is normal except my white blood cells were high (I have had a cold and sickness over the last month) plus I have trace sugar in my urine - should i be concerned?

Patient: I am a 25 year old white female. History of thyroid cancer in 2008, had my gallbladder removed in 2011 and I am a type 1 diabetic. What started as sporadic in nature is pretty much consistent. Right after I eat I feel a bubble like feeling on my left side that goes down to my lower ribs. If I eat it is more obvious but its almost always there now, just easier to feel after eating. It is not fixed by taking a gas reliever and it is not painful, just weird and uncomfortable.  Doctor: Hi and welcome to Chat Doctor. Thank you for your quarry. It sounds like stomach issue. All this is caused by high acid secretion which is found in gastritis, HERD or hiatus hernia. These disorders can cause such difficulties, and you should do gastrostomy to evaluate this. Symptoms that are experienced in such conditions are pain and tightness in upper stomach, bloating, breathing difficulties, heartburn, feeling of lump and sore in throat, gurgling sound in throat, fatigue and loss of appetite. Symptoms are aggravated after meal, long sitting, leaning forward, stress and anxiety. In the beginning this is treated by changing dietary habits. You should avoid alcohol, coffee, smoking, fats and fast food, carbonated Chat Doctor.  1 hour after meal you should not sit or lay. Also lay with elevated upper body. If you are overweight you should do often exercise. Secondly, there are antacid medicines which are usually helpful, you should consult your GP about this. If symptoms persist, you should do gastrostomy and stomach biopsy to verify is there Helicobacter pylori infection which can be treated then. Hope I have answered your query. If you have any further questions I will be happy to help

Patient: A 35-yr-old female, 5, weighing 90lbs. History started 3 and a half days ago, she started having fever ranging fr 37.5 to 38.9 degrees Centigrade with headache. no other symptoms. A day later, CBC was done, WBC 1.8, hematocrete .47, segmenter .59 lymphocite .39, platelet 99. fever went down to normal but on the same evening recurred (38.1), the following day, fever again resolved and recurred the following evening (38.3) accompanied by appearance of petechiae on posterior aspect of both lower legs. Patient has slightly poor appetite but with no other symptoms  Doctor: Hello. Fever and petechial are often symptoms of meningococcal disease or sepsis. I would go and visit ER as soon as possible. Right treatment on time will shorten illness and reduce maybe long-lasting problems. All the best.
Patient: Hi, My name is AAAAA and I am 50 years old. In 2006 I was treated for Anal Squamous Cell Carcinoma . That treatment consisted of Infusion Chemo with 5 Fu, Minomyacin and Cisplatin. I also had 9 weeks of External Beam Radiation. I am 7 years cancer free, which allows me to say that I am cured. Though a major side effect of cisplatin is Peripheral Neuropathy , that never happened to me while I was having treatments or any time soon after treatments. Oddly enough, a year and a half ago, I started having a tingling and burning in a localized area in my right foot. Where the toes meet the metatarsal bones on the foot pad. It started in a small area and slowly began to spread throughout the entire foot pad. It is also now in my left foot, but is worse in the right. The feeling started a a generalized numbness, and is now a combination of burning, tingling,small electric shock feelings in my toes, which only happens sometimes. I finally went to a Neurologist that did an NCR and EMG test. the results came back positive for peripheral Neuropathy. The doctor deemed it idiopathic and offered me drugs to take to alleviate the discomfort. When I asked her what caused this to happen, she said we will never know and the best we can do is manage the symptoms. Well, that certainly did not sit right with me. I have since been on a journey to get to the root cause of this condition. I do not have pain, it is more like a constant chronic irritation, but I do know that this is a progressive condition so I certainly need to take action. My approach is two steps. First I ve researched some alternative treatments and procedures to try to re-establish the current failing health of the peripheral nerves. I just started taking a Neuropathy support formula that contains the more absorbable form of B 12 2000 mcg,B1 300mcg,B6 4mg,B2 4mg, R-ALA 150mg, and vitamin D 500 IU. I am taking this formula 2x a day with an additional 300 mg R-ALA. In addition to this I will be going for treatments using the Rebuilder. This is similar to a tens machine, but uses different frequencies that have been shown to assist in the body s ability to repair. Hopefully, I will get some results with this protocol. The second part of my journey, is the more complicated part. Trying to get to the root cause. I do know that there are hundreds of factors that can contribute to the development of neuropathy. Here are just a few, autoimmune disease, nutritional deficiencies,heavy metal poisoning,hormone imbalances, many metabolic dysfunctions like kidney disease, liver disease, thyroid disease, onset of pre diabetes, digestion issues that can cause chronic long term systemic inflammation, structural dysfunction like spinal nerve compression or stenosis, and peripheral vascular disease. I have already began this journey. I have an appointment with a top Neurologist at the Weil Cornell Medical Center in NYC.He specializes in peripheral neuropathy and has developed a blood test to test to see is the neuropathy is being caused by an auto immune dysfunction. I am also seeing a top spine surgeon at the Hospital for Special Surgery in NYC. I do have several back issues in the lumbar spine. I have had various MRI s done, at would like them read by a top notch specialist. I will also be having some blood work done to rule out many of the other dysfunctions that I mentioned above. I would also like to check for vitamin and mineral deficiencies. All of these office visits and tests are quite costly, but I will not sit back and wait for my condition to deteriorate. It would be nice to be able to do this all under one umbrella. I did think of checking out the Mayo Clinic, but none of them are close to my home. I d like to know what your opinion is regarding my approach to help find the root cause of this condition, and if you have any suggestions for me. thank you for your time.  Doctor: Hi, peripheral neuropathy is a side effect of cisplatin, but also associated with systemic disease like diabetes, autoimmune disease. Your ESR report should be mentioned. Thyroid profile and blood sugar report also to be mentioned. If you have any sensory or motor deficit then proper level to found out and MRI can be done. Your decision regarding selection of top specialist is perfect. Specialized opinion is definitely needed. In my opinion gabapentin and SSRI group of Chat Doctor.  Take care.

Patient: I have a pea size lump way under the skin on my bikini line. It has been there a few moths now. Often times the swelling in it dies down to virtually nothing, but sometimes (often when Im on my period) it increases is size again. It isnt always painful but sometimes it is.  Doctor: Hi! Thanks for writing to us and sharing your health concerns regarding a pea size lump way under the skin on your bikini line. When a person comes to my clinic with such skin nodule first I examine him/her and then if not confirmed about a possibility, I go for FNAC/BIOPSY TEST from the nodule! In such cases I think of few possibilities like:1. A reactive lymph node that gets enlarged with reaction to local infection2. A sebaceous cyst getting infected intermittently3. Some benign skin tumor like lipoma, neurofibroma or dermatofibromaTherefore you must see a doctor for a clinical assessment! Hope you got the answer. Please revert to us if any more queries. Wishing you good health!

Patient: iam suffuring from oromandibular dystonia. symptom: constant urge to open mouth and to keep the mouth open. previously i had tendency to head jerking, hand jerking , leg jerking but those are now gone taking homeo treatment.but now i cannot resist the present symptom. what kind of treatment i can take?is it curable?  Doctor: Hello, From your description of the other body parts jerking in the past and now the mouth becoming involved you may wish to get some genetic testing done to discover whether you have a mutation in the DYT1 gene complex.  No particular medication does better than any other except for BOTOX which improves symptoms of dystonia in about 70% of patients properly injected. Homeopathic treatment is unlikely to help with this problem.  Unfortunately CURABLE is not the right term to use for this condition since we don't fully understand what causes it in the first place, but it is something that can be managed.

Confused and whom to consult for correct diognestic for start of TB treatment. pl advise.ibrao  Doctor: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Your daughter is having septic arthritis of hip joint with collection of fluid (synovial effusion). Most common cause for this is tuberculosis. Her TB gold test is also positive with high CRP (C Reactive Protein) and ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate). All these favor TB more. But confirmation should be done by aspiration of synovial fluid from hip joint and send it for ADA (adenosine Deaminate) level. ADA is marker of tb infection fluid. So if ADA of fluid is also high, better to start anti TB Chat Doctor.  So consult orthopedic doctor and discuss synovial fluid aspiration. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your daughter. Thanks.
Patient: I am a 27 yr old female and have been diagnosed with tonsillitis. I have started a weeks supply of penicillin and my symptoms are a sore throat, enlarged and pus covered tonsils, swollen neck glands, fever and headaches. I am sweating a lot during the night. I had visited my doctor earlier last week complaining of fatigue but at that stage i did not have a sore throat. She sounded my chest and told me she could hear a heart murmur- this is the first time any doctor ever picked up on this. I am wondering could the 2 be correlated? Thanks  Doctor: Hi! Thanks for sharing your concern with us. I read carefully what you said, and my answer is: Yes, the heart murmur your doctor heard could be due to the tonsillitis infection that you had. From your description that the tonsils were enlarged and covered by pus and with swollen neck lymph nodes, it is very likely that you had an infection from group A Streptococcus. This infection damages con also damage the valves of the heart, and this is the reason of the heart murmur heard. I would recommend you, that you finish all your treatment with penicillin until the end. Even though you might feel better and have no tonsillitis symptoms anymore, it is very important to complete the full treatment for preventing further complications (such might be the post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis). I wish you get better soon! Please do not hesitate to write me if you have further questions. Kind regards,
Patient: I have Trigimenal Neuralgia. The Maxillary Branch.  I have a upper denture and my pain is in the right side of my gums. I am not having the sudden shock like pain of the past, but my gums are like they have been burnt. It hurts worse if I lean over to the right. I feel like this is the Neuralgia, but am not sure. I find when these attacks happen they last up to 2weeks. The gums look like the skin has been severely blistered and its horrible pain to touch the gum when it hits. Is this really Neuralgia or something else? I have had it for about 7years and its only on the right side. Started off feeling like horrible shocks and sometimes like abscessed tooth.  Doctor: HiT hanks for the query. Well it looks like some nerve related problem only. But in case if the gums become blistered then it can be a viral infiltration of the nerve. As it is a chronic condition you should consult an Oral Physician or an Oral Surgeon and get evaluated. An MRI SCAN can be done to rule out the exact cause of the symptoms and treatment can be done according to the diagnosis. If it is nerve related pain then neurotic painkillers like Carbamazipine, Gabapentin etc. can be advised. If it is due to viral Infection then antiviral medication can help Hope this helps Regards

Patient: Can rabies be transferred through blood? I may have ran over something and when I came inside after cleaning it I forgot to wash my hands and began playing a video game then I realized I needed to wash my hands so I did then I came back and forgot to clean my mouse and I have a bad habit of biting my nails. So if the animal did have rabies could I have rabies now?  Doctor: Hello than to contact Chat Doctor.

But I think you have not injured your finger during biting the nail so do not worry regarding that. If you have anything else to ask kindly contact me Chat Doctor, Infectious Disease specialist.

Patient: my two and a half year old has a very sore throat - red, no white blotches i can see. Hes very cranky. Ive been giving him baby nurofen. HIs tonsils look very close together. Hes a bit  of the runs but otherwise eating a bit of sof t food like rice, cereal. Should I take him to get anti-biotics? thanks  Doctor: Welcome to the ChatDoctorIn my opinion, your child is suffering from tonsillopharyngitis. It can be a viral or bacterial tonsillitis. Points in favor of bacterial infection are:-high temperature-white pus-filled spots on the tonsils-no cough-swollen and tender lymph nodes (glands)There's no specific treatment for tonsillitis, but there are several things that can help alleviate the symptoms. For example:-taking paracetamol or ibuprofen to help relieve pain- Chat Doctor.  Oral penicillin for 10 days are given. Full course should be completed.
Patient: I have high blood pressure and have had blood pressure for 4 years. It developed sometime in my last trimester of pregnancy but I didn t have Preeclampsia. I am not able to see a doctor due to no health insurance or money so I have not taken any medication to help lower my blood pressure. Occasionally, I would have heart palpitations (flutters) but they were faint and it happened once a week at the most or sometimes just once a month. I went in for a tooth extraction Tuesday Feb. 25th where I had to get 2 teeth removed but they were simple extractions. I was given Hydrocodone for pain and Ammoxicillin to prevent infection. Sometime Saturday March 1st, I felt the heart palpitations pick up and would feel them about 3 times every hour or so. I hadn t take the hydrocodone since Wednesday or Thursday the week of the extraction. But I was still taking the ammoxicillin. I had a friend come over that Saturday night and everything was fine when she was here. Sunday March 2nd, the heart palpitations seemed like they worsened so a friend of mine had given me a Xanax which seemed to have calmed them down and I was able to relax and sleep that night. A day or 2 after that, I started feeling weird and was getting lightheaded. It would come and go and I would also get heart palpitations a few times a day. Some were really hard and then some were really faint. I was told to stop taking the ammoxicillin by the dentist and see what happens after 24 hours. I stopped taking them around 1am Tuesday March 4th. Here and there I still get the heart flutters, but then I had people trying to tell me what to do which caused me to get angry and crying a lot so I know my blood pressure was through the roof at that point. I also had a little chest pressure. I had 1 or 2 heart flutters that night and I was feeling lightheaded. Then Wednesday March 5th, I was still feeling lightheaded but that would come and go. I didn t feel any chest pressure. It didn t stop me from eating or anything like that. But I started taking 2 teaspoons of Beetroot juice sometime that day because I was reading about it helping blood pressure. I also put cinnamon on my food, eating banana s and drinking nothing but water and vitamin water. It is Friday, March 7th, and sometimes I still feel the lightheadedness but not like it was. Sometimes when I drink, I begin to feel it while I am drinking or after I feel it. I also feel a little pressure on my chest and my heart pounding a little hard and fast. I even try singing and I start to feel the lightheadedness and chest pressure. It doesn t do that when I eat. I still get heart flutters but have only had 1 today and it was faint. I don t know if this may just be anxiety or something more serious. This didn t start happening until a few days after the tooth extraction which made me wonder if something may have caused it or if now my blood pressure is finally causing other problems which worries me because I do not have a lot of money or health insurance. So I have to find ways to lower blood pressure myself, also taking medication for high blood pressure is the last thing that I want to do.  Doctor: Hi, Having high blood pressure is really important and can badly affect one's life. It is important to have medications to control your blood pressure but if you are not willing to take medications I suggest you to do the following to have your blood pressure controlled:1. No salt intake (even when cooking food)2. At least 45 minutes fast walking each day3. No use of processed food4. High use of fruits and vegetables5. Reducing weight to the extent you can6. Having no anxiety Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.
Patient: I am 14 years old and I have been experiencing some pains on my second molar tooth. It has recently started growing and the gum around it was inflamed. Also the inflamed gum covers most of the tooth. It hurts when i close my mouth, eat food, and when I spit out water while brushing my teeth. I have been brushing,flossing, and rinsing my mouth with mouth wash, but that doesnt seem to make the problem any better. I would like to know what I can to help the gum less inflamed. Thank You.  Doctor: Hello, Thanks for writing to us. Initially, cause of inflammation has to be evaluated clinically by a dentist. Get thorough scaling done. If there is deep caries, get root canal treatment done. Pus has to be Chat Doctor. Take amoxicillin along with analgesics. If there is periodontal infection, root planning has to be done. Meanwhile, brush and floss your teeth daily. Maintain oral hygiene well. Hope these suffices.
Patient: Hello Dr. Grief. The past couple days ive been having really deep pulsating type pain on my right low flank side about a month ago i became coumiden toxic with an INR of 120 with similar pain accompanied by blood in my urine with similar pain. (this feels different/deeper and an increased urgency of urination is noted bit no burning or remarkable coloration) no stones, or infection was present last month via cat scan, CBC and urinalisis. Everytime have complained abut this discomfort and had the standard test i come back negative for stones. I have a history of Factor V, Kidney Stones , and Renal Cholic. Any idea what could be causing this ?  Doctor: Presence of a blood clot in urinary bladder is a possibility. I think you should get a cystoscope examination of bladder done by a urologist. You can still have an atypical infection of urinary tract with fungus or tuberculosis etc. which would not be picked up on routine urine culture and need special cultures or detection by PCR (of urine sample) for tuberculosis.
Patient: MY DAUGHTER WAS SEEN IN THE ER FOR ABDOMINAL PAIN,FEVER,& VOMITING. HER LABS CAME BACK SHOWING HER WHITE BLOOD CELL COUNT WAS HIGH.

CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT IS WRONG?  Doctor: With high blood cell count, chills and unable to hold her urine I would think of a urinary tract infection as a high possibility. Check urine for routine and microscopy examination and then proceed for further investigations if required. Take care

Cries when I take her temp. in her ears and I check temp from both ears to ensure accuracy. She has nut and egg allergies and I feared allergic reaction, but now I m wondering if this is an ear infection?  Doctor: Hi.... what you are quoting is called toxic urticaria. Sometimes any simple viral illness can cause this sort of allergic reaction in the body along with high fever. I suggest you continue giving Paracetamol or Ibuprofen for fever. If the Rash or allergic reaction is persisting even after few hours, I suggest you to give HY Chat Doctor.  But this is a prescription

Cough can occur due to infection to tonsils, upper or lower respiratory tract, and swelling in the lower legs can be due to fever. Let me know if he has done urine albumin test as loss of protein in urine can cause swelling.what's the duration of cough? You can take tab paracetamol for fever, and tab.

Patient: I had a peritonsillar abscess a month ago. I healed well with a 10 day course of clindamycin and drainage. I had my teeth cleaned 2 weeks ago and I have no dental caries and excellent oral hygiene . 2 days after the cleaning my jaw felt a little stiff and the gums where my wisdom tooth was 20 years ago felt swollen. I went to urgent care last week thinking it was recurring. The MD said no it is pharyngitis . It came and went. Today it happened again and I now see a small, almost clear bubble at the base of my uvula. Could this be a recurring abcess? Should I take the Aumentin I was given in urgent care in case my throat were to get worse?  Doctor: Hello there... Do you mean that your wisdom tooth was removed? If so when you have recurrent peri-tonsillar abscess (called Quinsy) the clinical symptoms are mainly pain while swallowing, swelling at your base of uvula, deviation of uvula to the opposite side, redness in the soft palate region, with an opening with pus discharge either adjacent to the uvula or over the consular region.  To the pus creeping into the adjacent spaces, there are chances that one might end up with difficulty in mouth opening. Though Augmenting is Chat Doctor.

Patient: i have a daughter who is 2yrs 8 months old.from past 1 month she is having pain when having old or hot stuff in her teeths. we took her to the dentest who told us 3 of her front teeth have a cavatity & need to go through root canal treatment.we got her checked from 2 other dentest. problem is each one is have a diff procedure. first dentest told us that it will take 20 - 30 minities & only injection to be given on the teeth nerves, secount doc said root canal not reqd will just do it like that third doc says we will need to treat her at rainbow hospital where they will give anasthesia. just confused what to do & were to go. if u can suggest something to us ?  Doctor: Hi. Welcome to Chat Doctor . I have gone through your query and can understand your concern.... As per your complaint in case if there is pain in teeth on taking both hot and cold foods then it is most probably due to deep infection or decay in teeth and will need Root Canal Treatment. Yes, it is true that for Root Canal Treatment, the dentist has to give anesthesia, but it is a local anesthesia and only the area of the treatment is made numb in this case. If you are asked to go to Rainbow hospital for getting anesthesia then it is possible that he wants to do the treatment in general anesthesia to make your child sleep. Although nothing is wrong in even that as toddlers are anxious and will not co-operate in treatment, so general anesthesia eases the treatment procedure. But my suggestion is to consult a Pediatric dentist or Periodontist and get evaluated, and first you should get an attempt to get the treatment done in local anesthesia or conscious sedation. In case if the child does not co-operate at all then only proceed to General Anesthesia. Hope this information helps. Thanks and regards. Chat Doctor. .

Patient: Hello, I have also recently been diagnosed as having mild paraseptal emphysema. Im 25 years old and was wondering if Im going to be dead in four years like some of the material I have read has suggested? I had a lung test the other day and got told that my lungs are performing at 92%; there didnt appear to be any urgency from the doctor to tell me Im going to be dead soon. Will I be able to live past this threshold? Also, how much past four years? Thanks.  Doctor: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Lung function of 92% is considered very good. So no need to worry about death or any disease. Mild para septal emphysema on CT is mostly an accidental finding. If you don't have any symptoms (breathing difficulty, cough, expectoration) then no need to worry about mild para septal emphysema. Avoid smoking, alcohol, maintain good health by exercise. No need to worry about death after 4 years. Yoi will definitely be good. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.

Blood culture report can be done with CBC examination also. If bacteremia present treated accordingly. If still condition worsen then according to physical examination further work up done. CT scan may be needed. Wish you good health. Chat Doctor.

There is always a good catch in an elucidated history as provided by you. Your history of foul stools tells it all. Read and understood all your history related to 2 craniectomies and severe abdominal pain after 3 days. This is the time you must have undergone the super-added intestinal infection as we call in out medical language, and must have been overlooked by all. I would suggest you the following actions:-First I will order for examination of the stools for 3 consecutive days.-Routine test soph blood and urine. -Start you on a 5-day course of an antibiotic and Metronidazole and probiotics. -Probiotics to be continued for a long time say at least a month.

And to give you the treatment as to get a cure. Remember to Avoid the Ciprofloxacin group as you have undergone craniectomies. I hope this answer helps you

Patient: I have been diagnosed with a mediastinal mass. In 1996, I had 2 thoracic surgeries due to cryptococcal pneumonia. I lost my upper left lobe of my lung cavity. Ten days later had to have a pericardium graft to seal my lower left lobe that the pneumonia had begun to damage. I took several rounds of diflucan antibiotics till my blood cell counts returned to normal. I m currently being seen by pulmonary specialist who feels that this mass is a result of scar tissue. Over past year I have noticed changes with my pain level, night sweats, shortness of breath, etc. anxiety / stress causes my chest to constrict as if a boa constrictor is squeezing the breath out of me. By having the 2 surgeries I lost 4 of my 5th left rib when I was only to loose 4cm! In the beginning my doctor diagnosed my situation as being scar tissue, another physician referred to it as a left hilar mass, now they refer to it as a mediastinal mass. I m scheduled for a pft test this week & have had chest X-ray last march, followed by cat scan w/ contrast last April ,& finally a cat scan this past Friday but contrast couldn t be used because after 8 attempts to have an IV contrast was cancelled. Medical assistants stated I wasn t dehydrated. They could pull the blood but when they tried to flush either vein blew or dried up . Specialist says I m not a surgical candidate . They do consistently use the term mass & not tumor. What s the difference & chances of my recovery?  Doctor: Hi Dear !! Thanks for your query to Chat Doctor. Read and reviewed your query and health concerns. You seem to suffer from -Streptococcal Pneumonia with fibrotic lung and with COPD. Mediastinal Mass could be from-Scarring or Could be from Cryptococciosis spread from streptococcal Lung infection which was excised last. Because of this extensive mediastinal mass, Specialist says yo you're not a surgical candidate. They do consistently use the term mass & not tumor. Q- What's the difference-Ans-NO practical difference, but in your case-it has different meaning-like-you mostly have extensive -radio-opaque mass-in mediastinum, indicating extensive lung lesion spreading to mediastinum also. Only possibility of care and cure -is by antifungal medicines. & chances of my recovery-are grim in your case. But see if you get benefits from antifungal medicines.

Patient: I FEEL SURE MY HUSBAND HAS HAD AND IS STILL HAVING MINI STROKES. WE HAVE HAD EVERY TEST DONE THAT THE DOCTOR ASK, THE LAST THING SUGGESTED WAS ANOTHER MRI OF HIS BRAIN BUT IT HAS NOT BEEN SCHEDULED YET. WHAT SHOULD I DO AND HOW SOON IS IT NECESSARY. HE CANNOT WALK HIS LEFT LEG IS NUMB AND HE IS HAVING TROUBLE KNOWING WHEN HE IS USING THE BATHROOM, BOTH URINATING AND BOWEL MOVEMENTS. HE STAYS CONFUSED ALL THE TIME .  Doctor: Hello, Sorry for your distress. The confusion is a sign of a problem with the brain. The leg numbness and bathroom problems can be due to a problem in the brain or spine. A condition which may tie all these in is known as normal pressure HY Chat Doctor. An MRI of the brain should be able to identify this condition and I would advise you to get that done. The MRI of the brain is also a good way to check for stroke. All the best.
Patient: I have terrible sinuses. I get frequent infections, particularly in tr maxillary sinuses. However, I had a filling in one of my top, back left teeth Thursday. I already had sore throat when I went in. My throat has become increasingly painful and over the course of today (Friday) I notice a marble size lump on the roof of my mouth toward my top right furthest back molar. The prompt care dr said it is an abscess and sent me to the ER, BUT I called the dentist on call before going to the ER and she told me NOT to go to ER and gave me Amoxicillin 500mg TIDx7d.  How can I tell I its dental or sinus related??  Doctor: Hello there, Thanks for writing your query, Lumps seen in the oral cavity can be of various types. It can be due to infective lesions related to tooth like periodontal abscess or gingival abscess Chat Doctor.  According to your clinical history I suspect your upper tooth which has already got a filling has got infection that has spread to the palatal area leading to formation of abscess in the form of lump. Exact diagnosis can be made only after clinical examination and evaluation by taking radiographs.  I would suggest you to get and OPG radiograph done which will help in diagnosis and accordingly treatment can be planned.  Consult an oral surgeon and get the examination done. I hope this helps, take care.

Stress and anxiety are associated with depression Smoking or alcohol is like self medications in depression. It will temporarily reduce it but on long term use of it may lead to dependence and worsen psychological illness. You have required proper treatment.

Patient: My 8 yr old was just diagnosed with systemic mastocytosis . We know it is in the intestines. He has had bad abdominal pain for a month now. Blood dr a ppt. And allergist a ppt not for several weeks. No one is taking this seriously. What I read online states otherwise. Should we bring him to st Jude?  Doctor: Hello, welcome to Chat Doctor. Mastocytosis is a rare disorder consisting of too many mast cells in the body. Because mast cells play a role in allergic reactions, the symptoms of mastocytosis often are similar to the symptoms of an allergic reaction. Symptoms include fatigue, abdominal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, etc. The diagnosis can be made by bone marrow biopsy. There is no specific treatment for it and treatment consists of symptomatic medication. SO you should not worry about him and just take him to your doctor for treatment of his symptoms. Wish him good health.
Patient: Hi I have just found a ping pong ball sized lump on the right side of my neck just above my collarbone...I have had asthma like symptoms for over a year (ended up in hospital twice due to breathing problems).I had blood tests done and my white blood count was higher than it should be but never found out why.I have also been very tired and very pale.My mouth always seems dry and the past fortnight I have been sweating alot more,getting migranes so bad that i feel im going to pass out.What is wrong with me. I am 22 yrs old.Female  Doctor: The following investigations should be done:1. USG Neck2, FNAC (Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology) of your enlarged Rt. Supraclavicular Lymph Node.3. Chest X-Ray4. Tuberculin Test (Manitou Test)5. Detailed blood investigations (esp. with your high WBC Count!)6. Sputum for AFB x 3 days7. CT / MRI Neck + Chest and USG Abdomen may also be considered Constitutional symptoms such as breathlessness (asthma like symptoms), fatigue, night sweats, migraine headaches could suggest disorders such as tuberculosis, lymphoma, collagen vascular diseases, unrecognized infection or malignancy. Do you have fever, cough or unexplained weight loss? Kindly post your test results.
Patient: Hi My name is Manju living in Auckland, NZ. Its regarding my pregnancy. I conceived 3 times and ended up with 3 different types of anomalies. First one was Anencephaly, second one was single ventricle and in third heart beat stopped in 10th week.. I have undergone all related test including Karyotyping, HSG, Blood Tests, Laparoscopy, Hormone tests etc for finding out the reason. Everything resulted in Normal/positive. Now I am planning for a baby. Consulted with a GP here. He made me to do all blood tests and results are very normal. He referred me to Geneticist. Waiting for her appointment. What would you suggest me in this context? Help me if possible.  Doctor: Hi, I think first do a semen analysis of your partner. Sometimes defective sperms are the reason for abnormalities. Also, I think it would be a better option for you to undergo an IVF and then go for preimplantation genetic diagnosis for the embryos. The embryos which are healthy will be transferred to your uterus. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.
Patient: I have muscles and joints pain since 8 months now, this come and go may be come for two weeks then dissapear then come again , i went to the doctor and he made complete blood count test but every thing was normal , im tired what can i do more to know the cause?  Doctor: Hello, As pain coming and going is always having to be assessed and examined when the symptoms are high. Usually, the blood tests are performed to check out if any pathology of infection is leading to such. Since the tests are normal for now I will advise you to take dietary supplements of calcium and also vitamin D through sunbath. Usually, in some cases, it happens due to lack of calcium and vitamin D. Also, try doing regular 30 minutes of regular physical exercise and see if these symptoms are coming again. Because with physical exercise your metabolism and muscle physiology will improve, and the symptoms should not arise again. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

Patient: Ive had pressure headaches and heart palpitations for a few months now..ive had two episodes of feeling faint during this time...my chest hurts off and on everyday and flutters all the time...i get sharp pains in my head now and then and have colds sensations in my chest from time to time...i havent felt right since this all started..i was put on zoloft, my doctor thought it was anxiety. Ive been to the ER 3 times. Ive had an ultrasound, chest xray, ct scan w/ contrast (head)  Doctor: Hello! Welcome and thank you for asking on Chat Doctor! Regarding your concern, I would explain that your symptoms could be related to a cardiac arrhythmia. This would not explain the sharp headaches, which could be just ice pick headache, which is a benign type of headache. Anxiety could also play an important role in all this clinical scenario. In such case, you should know that it may take up to two weeks for the effects of Zoloft to be seen. Anyway, I would recommend performing some further tests to exclude a possible cardiac arrhythmia: - an ambulatory 24-48 hours ECG monitoring to examine your heart rhythm trends for a prolonged time-thyroid hormone levels to exclude a possible thyroid dysfunction. Hope to have been helpful! Wishing all the best,
Patient: Have low blood platelets 30 k Had bone marrow biopsy it showed nothing. Dr started me on a course of Predisone taking 6  20mg tablets a day for 2 weeks,then 4 a day for 1 week ,then 3 a day for 1 week then 2 a day for  a week then 1 a day for a week ,plus sptra/bactrim ds 2 pills a day on Mon.wed.and Friday. Taking this much kinda scars me, but i guess it is what i must do.  Doctor: Thanks for putting up your question so nicely. Decreased platelets counts (pancytopenia or thrombocytopenia) is due to many causes and if every test comes normal and no cause is associated, then it is called "idiopathic thrombocytopenia" which simply means "decreased platelets without any cause."  If I were attending my patient, and every blood test I did come normal except platelets. I would prescribe the same Chat Doctor.  Sptra/Bactrim is antibiotic which is prescribed by the doctor because steroids (prednisone) reduces immunity.  Yes you have to take these
Patient: Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ? Please type your query here...dear sir, i am 6 weeks pregnant with occassional green discharge streaked with blood which i belive is from my cervical erosion. the problem is i lost my last baby at 20 weeks due to chorioamnionits with strep b, staphaureus, ecoli colonisation on the high vaginal swab and on the placenta post mortem. I continue to be a strep b carrier and am terrified that this green cervicla erosion discharge is the perfect medium for a repeat episode of chrioamnionitis. my obsterician says statistically i am no more at risk than the next woman despite my history and that he will treat the strep b at 14 weeks although it will probably recolinise itself within weeks of treatment. Is there any thing more that can be done? I wish i had , had the erosion cauterised prior to pregnancy although it didnt affect my first pregnancy at all and i have a healthy 3.5 year old daughter. any advise would be greatly appreciated,  Doctor: Hello, I have gone through your query and understood your concern. It is very unfortunate to have lost the pregnancy. Your obstetrician is the better judge in this matter though I would suggest a vaginal and cervical swab along with urinalysis to detect the cause of this discharge. Vaginal applications may be used with caution if needed though oral treatment is not prescribed for fungal or Trichomoniases infections at this stage of pregnancy. Your past infection need not necessarily recur. Yet, you should be watchful. Please maintain proper genital hygiene and avoid intercourse.  Chat Doctor.  Hope this helps.

Patient: 47 Y/O Male.  The end of June I started having upper mid back pain...burning, decreased range of motion of neck, and then i started to have muscle twitching over different areas of my body. Deltoid, thigh, forarms, calfs, sometimes the back.  They bounce around and are not in the same area.  Rest seems to help.  No weakness and reflexes are normal.  Doctor: Dear friend as you have said the pains are bounces around and there is problem in reflex action I, from my experience as a clinician, must say you don't have any serious problem. Certainly you have a fatigue AOR pain all around your body part. This can be due generalized fatigue syn Chat Doctor. Alsoyou should go for a simple biochemical test for serum sodium, potassium.a mild disbalance causes our muscles get fatigued frequently. So, a conservative approach towards your affected group of muscle with necessary investigation will clinch the diagnosis. Thank you.
Patient: I was on chloroquine for about two years to treat lyme disease and since then I have developed what my dermotologist diagnosed as keratoderma on the soles of my feet. If this is a drug induced disease, (I am otherwise 56 and in excellent health), do I stand a better chance of getting rid of it? No family history of it.  Doctor: Hi, Keratoderma is thickening of skin that occurs commonly in palms and soles. This condition can be genetic or can be induced by chronic diseases and use of certain medications. Chloroquine can cause this condition. Keratodermas are not curable, but symptoms can be controlled. Treatment options include regular use of emollients, keratolytics such as salicylic acid or urea and topical/systemic retinoids. Take care. Hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further.
Patient: Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ? Please type your query here...I m an SLP and I have a student with a deviated uvula towards the right side. He is also hoarse and I m seeing him for sh, ch and J(judge) sounds. Should I have him investigate further?  Doctor: Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query. The deviated uvula can occur as a developmental defect or a complication of oral sub mucous fibrosis. It has nothing to do with speech. So consult an oral physician and get his oral cavity completely examined to rule out tongue tie, where the tongue will be partially or completely fused with the floor of the mouth. In this situation patients will have difficulty in pronouncing sh, ch.j sounds. If it is a tongue tie then it can be released with surgery. So you need to consult an oral physician and get it examine completely. I hope my answer will help you, take care.
Patient: my wife had 2 gall stones and her gall bladder removed 2months ago, since then she has experianced diarrah constantly and also has been bleeding like on a period, some times light and other times quite heavy, is there a cause for concern and should we see a doctor.???  Doctor: Hi.thanks for posting query at Chat Doctor. The cause of diarrhea after gallbladder removal is not certain. Some experts believe that it results from an increase in bile, especially bile acids which may act as laxative in the large intestine. It should subside soon, usually lasts from few days to few months.advise:- Avoid high-fat foods, fried and greasy foods-Add soluble fiber, such as oats and barley, to your diet. But be sure to increase the amount of fiber slowly, such as over several weeks, because too much fiber at first can make gas and cramping worse.- Eat smaller, more-frequent meals. - avoid caffeine and dairy product swish her good n sound health regards Chat Doctor.
Patient: I was having an abdominal pain on the right lower side of the abdomen thinking it was appendix and was given agumentin tablet to take for 7day morning and night. After taking the I was still feeling the same pain, and was asked to go for urine culture test, which result shows I have moderate growth of staph aureus. I was told told to take ciprotab for 14days, that one tablet twice daily. Today been the sixth day and still feeling the pain. Its goes and come.  Doctor: Hello took augmenting tablet for appendicitis, later on taking ciprofloxacin for urinary tract infection. Still don't get relief. Such type of pain may be due to these possibilities, these include.1 Renal calculus, as you are also having UTI (infection), although there is no complete relief, but some relief is there after ciprofloxacin (as you mentioned in the query that there is pain, but it goes and come i.e. some relief). Diagnosis can be confirmed by ultrasound of both kidneys.2 Amoebic colitis is another common cause of such type of pain. Diagnosis can be confirmed by physical examination as well stool examination for amoeba history.3 If you are a female patient then such type of pain may be due to salpingitis. Get in ultrasound of both ovaries. In my opinion consult a gastroenterologist and get his opinion as 15 days passed for this pain. Good luck.

What you have to do are 1. Do an ultrasound scan of whole abdomen to find out any abnormality.  2. Do a hormonal study comprising estrogen, progesterone, LH, FSH, etc. 3.

Patient: I fell and my face hit my dresser and my teeth went through my upper lip and my face was cut. I received 6 stitches on my lip/face across the vermillion border that I had removed 2 months ago and one stitch that dissolved inside of my upper lip. I was left with a decent scar line that healed quite nicely and straight but there is a huge hard ball inside of my upper lip where the stitches were. Its the size of a marble and I want to know if it is just scar tissue or something more and if it will dissolve over time. You cant see it from the outside unless I smile very big and you look closely, it protrudes a tiny bit. Its more annoying than anything feeling this huge ball inside my upper lip!  Doctor: Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query. The hard ball kind of structure could be because of the stitches or secondary to the trauma. It can be secondary to fibrosis wound healing, or it can be a fibrous or fibrosis muscle. Consult an oral physician and get it ruled out. If it is a fibrosis tissue then it takes some time to become normal(months). If it is increasing in size then get it surgically removed. I hope my answer will help you, take care.
Patient: I am a 67 year old man with kidney disease mambranous glomerulonephritis . My last lab work showed this disease to be in remissiion. I am taking Finasteride 5mg one a day, Hydrochlorothiaz 12.5 mg one a day and Ramipril 10 mg 2 a day. Two weeks ago my legs started to bruse and are bleeding internally. My doctor had me take more lab work and he will see me soon. My concern is about the Ramipril 10 mg 2 a day. Is this to much?  Doctor: April should not be the cause for this problem. It is likely that YOY have developed some complication of Membranous Glomerulonephritis. Is the Membranous glomerulonephritis primary or secondary?
Patient: My daughter is 16. She has had elevating kidney pain and some abdomen pain (around appendix area) for 2 weeks. We took her to the doctor. They performed an ultrasound. It showed an ovarian cyst had ruptured and another one was forming. We took her to the emergency room last night. Her blood work was completely normal. She had a catscan which was also completely normal. And a pelvic exam that was completely normal. Her symptoms conclude of fever, extreme coldness (to the point that she cant stop shaking), extreme kidney pain (mostly on right side, some on left), naseua, and elevated heart rate. She is so much pain that she cant walk or move. Any ideas on what it might be? Thank you.  Doctor: Hi. Thanks for your query. The pain in the right kidney and appendix area, shivering, fever, nausea inability to walk... all these symptoms can be suggestive of severe Pyelonephritis - a condition in which the infection of the urinary tract is so severe that even the kidneys get infected. This may not be found on CT and USG. I would advise her the following:Urine culture and sensitivity Blood culture and sensitivity. Urea, creatinine and all other relevant test. Admission to the hospitalIntravenous therapy of fluids and broad-spectrum antibiotics.
Patient: Hello Doctor , My wisdom tooth pain started on 9th Jan and it was severe.I took pain killers for first 4 days and it provided temporary relief.I started taking antibiotic Ampoxicillin since 13th along with ibuprofen.Pain has reduced a lot and now there is no pain at all while brushing,opening mouth or by touch.I feel slight pain or some sensation in jaw muscles or cheek muscles attached near the tooth.Is it just eruptive symptoms or infection or impacted tooth symptoms? Pain is not bothering,just that if I delay visit to doctor.Will it internally cause a problem?I am coming to India in March.And here dental charges are extreme.Please Help!!  Doctor: Hi, An erupting third molar would cause pain and discomfort which would subside gradually. A X-ray of the tooth should be taken to determine the actual position of the tooth. If the tooth is impacted it should be removed surgically. Medications are only a temporary solution to the problem. So visit your dentist at the earliest.

Patient: Hi,i would like to know what i could possibly be suffering from.am a19yr old girl and after i had malaria have had strange body fellings for 3months now...i dnt feel hungry or full,i cnt feel mybody no more..i am losing so much weight and my whole body feels stiff.and i am also having vision problems...what can it be?and what should i do?  Doctor: Hello I have gone through your question and understand your concern. In my opinion, it is better to take a complete blood picture to rule out deficiency anemia. Weakness and fatigue can be experienced by any individual recovering from illness, as body fights with the infection throughout the illness making one feel tired without any apparent physical activity. Malaria can even cause iron deficiency anemia with weakness, fatigue as malaria causing parasite feeds on and break down red blood cells, leading to anemia. If the test results show anemia, consult a doctor or update the reports at Chat Doctor or start with iron supplements available over the counter. Get vision checked by optometrist. Weight loss is common after recovering from sickness, nothing to worry eat fresh and nutritious food, take ample of rest and take a multivitamin for quick recovery. Good luck. Hope your concern is answered. Thank you.
Patient: I have developed a pain in my left lower abdomen. It is most painful when I first get out of bed and generally goes away during the day. The pain radiates from  approximately 6 inches to the left and 2 inches down from my navel. close to my hip joint. This morning it was more severe than usual. I have been experiencing this pain for about 6 months shortly after purchasing a new mattress.  I am a 67 year old male in generally good health. I am also a Type 2 diabetic.  Doctor: Hello, Thanks for posting on Chat Doctor, From your description, it seems to me you are suffering from abdominal muscle strain. Normally, when using a poorly designed mattress, it usually affects the back muscles and spines, but can also affect the abdomen. However, it will be best to get a doctor examine you in case you are having another internal problem such as a urinary tract affection, allopathic diseases, prostate disorder etc. Hope this helps

Patient: Will an antibiotic help my 27 year old son whose crowned molar #3 is hurting him? Dentist x-rayed duly and does not see anything wrong. Tho, when this tooth was crowned 2 1/2 years ago, it presented with a big filling and a big cavity. The pain is off and on-- for about 10-12 days now. Thank you !  Doctor: Why crowning has in done? Did your dentist go for root canal treatment?if has done act and crown the tooth the it is ok, in that Casey we have to assume that the pain is taking place due failure of act.act can be failed for many reason starting from pts status to the faulty procedure. But if your dentist did not act, only he filled the tooth and the he went for vital tooth preparation, the pain might happen due to secondary caries, or chronic irritation to the pulp. But in both cases' treatment is same, first remove the crown, thn go for reject or act. And I believe there will not be any pain in future
Patient: 39yrs male penile inflammation on foreskin along with mild rashes and redness...sometimes get itchy especially appears after usage of condom and brief sexual intercourse.... subsides after a couple days; but reappears again during next intercourse. usage of placentrex gel or soframycin will help?  Doctor: Hi, I had gone through your question and understand your concerns. First, you should rule out later allergy first or allergy to some soaps or shower gels or even to underwear. Second, it may be recurrent Atlantis and this is treated by antifungal cream such clotrimazole (Origin, Mycelia) is a very effective over-the-counter medication. Sometime sin more severe cases Sometimes a cortisone cream can help to improve the problem more quickly. If there won't be improvement then you need to consult urologist or dermatologist, and it would be good to avoid intercourse till symptoms persist. If discharge occur, you should do STD testing as well. Hope this answers your question. If you have additional questions or follow-up questions then please do not hesitate in writing to us. I will be happy to answer your questions. Wishing you good health.

Patient: Hi every morning my feet and hands are so stiff and tight. I can barely walk my first few steps then it gets better. My joints hurt and thigh muscles are burning. I had blood work done and they said it isnt arthritis. I have a lot of spinal problems could this be a result of that?

Patient: Hi. I fell starting t cross the street last Thursday. Twisted my left foot and broke the shoe (they were flats) and landed hard on my right knee. Knee has some fluid on it but seems to be getting better. Foot is swollen and seems to be getting worse. It is not discolored. Hurts most on top left of foot. Is this just a bad sprain or could I have broken something?  Doctor: Dear patient Since you have pain and swelling on left foot after twisting injury and not getting better possibility of fracture needs to be ruled out.  I would advise X-ray of left foot anteroposterior and oblique views. Visit radiology center nearby you and get it.  If report shows fracture you need to consult expert orthopedic surgeon nearby you and get yourself examined.  If there is no fracture diagnosis is sprain and treatment is application of crêpe bandage for 3 weeks and rest and elevation.  Take tab diclofenac plus serratiopeptodase combination twice a day for pain and swelling relief. All the best.
Patient: I have been feeling a fluttering sensation on the right side of my head at least 2-6 times a month since I can remember. I often have dizzy spells where I will be walking and my vision will go black from the outside. Then I usually sit down to avoid falling, but if I do that, I start seizing slightly. I usually can t feel direction, Gravity, sound or my body movements. After a few seconds, it passes, I get up and go on. But it happens several times a day. I have had an MRI done and nothing is out of the ordinary. No doctors have ever been alarmed at hearing any of this, or maybe they respond, Eat better. What is going on?  Doctor: Hi, thank-you for providing the brief history of you. As you mentioned that you have certain symptoms like dizziness, weakness and uncontrolled body movements. Since you have even undergone an MRI which has not revealed anything than it should not be a worry. Because most of the time MRI scan comes normal when there are no symptoms associated at that particular movement. Since you have tried with the physician I will recommend you to try physical therapy. Certain times when there are abnormal neural activity happening in brain tissue, it may lead to abnormal symptoms like dizziness, disturbance in vision, uncontrolled bodily movements etc. which can be controlled by the doing motor exercises. Motor exercises will help to have an active conscious control onto the muscles, and also it will help improve the metabolism and motor functions. I have met certain cases where the symptoms are same, and they got control of their symptoms by regular exercises. As the metabolism is improved it will also help to function of the motor centers of the brain better. Also, the dizziness will reduce. You can discuss the same with your physician. With the grace of God I wish you a speedy recovery regards
Patient: The FNAC investigation reported the presence of mature sperms and spermatoza. Further, very recently (just around 22 days back) I had undergone testicular biopsy procedure, the embryologist reported nil sperm in tissues extracted from left and right testis and sent the sample for histopathology in the same hospita where the pathologist reported mature spermatozoa in more than 90% tubules. Why the embryologist could not find sperms in the same tissues she investigated and whay Pathologist succeeded? Can testicular biopsy be repeated for freeze of sperm to use ICSI? Exactly after how many days gap, the testicular biopsy be repeated for extraction of sperm?  Doctor: HIF your testicular biopsy showed mature sperms you will be likely to get it again but most of the Chat Doctor. Your pathologist would have found the sperm because both the ways of looking for sperm is different. Pathologist can make multiple biopsies of your testis sample which may not be possible with the embryologist .you can discuss with an IVF consultant and if sperm freezing is available can undergo test and freeze your sperm and stimulate wife's ovulation for IVF. But preferably after 6 months of first biopsy

Patient: I am at work and had two indecencies in the last hour. Sitting at my desk typing and the back of my arms from my shoulders down to my hands cramped real bad and my chest tightened up and I got real flushed and nauseous and almost passed out. I put my arms above my head real fast so I could breathe and it went away after a couple of minutes. I have never remotely had this happen before.  Doctor: hello may consult a nearby doctor immediately or visit ER. A thorough check-up for pulse, BP, EKG and heart enzymes and other investigations must be done to rule out heart, lung problem and blood pressure issuesTake Tylenol or aspirin dispersible tablet and do hot fomentation to cramped muscles, light massage with muscle relaxant gels also till you see a doctor in ER thanks
Patient: My 16 yr old son fell on his skateboard and hurt his knee. No cuts or scraps but is having a lot of pain behind the kneecap. We have ice on it. It is swollen but not greatly. Should I take him to the ER or can I wait until tomorrow? He does not want to go AT ALL  Doctor: Hi there, Thanks for using Chat Doctor. You need to take him to ER since the knee is swollen. A swollen knee following a fall indicates there is some damage to either the soft tissues or the bones/cartilages. He may need X-rays and scan to look for these damages. Ibuprofen may be given for pain relief. The doctor may advise resting the knee for a short period of time. Is this answer helpful?
Patient: im suffering an infection in my head. it is pimple like swollen and painful at the same time. it keeps on coming back like twice a month. ive done self medication by taking antibiotics like amoxicillin 500, cefuroxime 500mg but i cut it in half since it is a strong antibiotic. now im taking cefalexin 500mg 3x a day. ive searched in the net but im confused if it is folliculitis, staph infection or worst methicillin resistant staph aureus (MRSA). what do you think is it and how can i cure it. im am in a foreign land right now and i dont know exactly where to find a clinic so im hoping you can help me. thanks!  Doctor: Hello dear, Thank you for your contact to Chat Doctor. I read and understand your concern. I am Chat Doctor answering your concern.First you should clear all the existing infections. As it is MRSA you should take the vancomycin as a treatment. Once the infection is clear further management can be started. After this I advise you to take mupirocin ointment applied over the groin, ear lobe, umbilicus, maxilla. Apply it for a period of 1 month than swab the above area for MRSA screening. If the swab shows the MRSA repeat the above medication. Once you receive the negative report you are clear from the MRSA. Please do not share household with the family members otherwise MRSA spreads to the household. Please take the good liquid hand wash sample in the home. This will take care for the good handwashing practice as this can be help full barrier in the prevention of the MRSA spread. I will be happy to answer your further concern on bit.ly/ Chat Doctor. Thank you, ChatDoctorInfectious diseases specialist, ChatDoctor.
Patient: My is Cornelia and I have trouble focusing when I m reading, are doing other things it seem like my mine is raceing all the time. My Doctor gave me some Citalopram 20mg but I m haveing some side affects from it could you tell me what it can take. That will help me with this problem.  Doctor: Degree understand your concerns went through your details. I suggest you not to worry much.  You are supposed to refer to concentration and attention as two. Attention span for any adult is maximum 30 minutes. Sometimes, a person can be attentive to an interesting thing for more than 30 minutes, such as movies or games. Concentration is attention plus understanding. For this too, span OS below 30 minutes. If you are able to make your studies interesting and based on variable principle, your concentration level can be increased. Concentration comes only when you are interested in what you do. So please be passionate towards what you are doing or do only those things which you are interested in. It is also possible to improve your concentration level with the help of yoga, meditation and breathing exercises. Psychotherapy techniques should suit your requirement.

Patient: Hello my five year old son was circumcised two days ago. He is still screaming a lot when it s time to urinate. It s not the actual urination that hurts him, he says he can t pee unless he pushes and the pushing is what hurts. He also seems to have great difficulty going even though he has to go pretty bad. Should I be concerned?  Doctor: Yes please... This is not routine after 5 days so after circumcision. I suggest you get back to your pediatric surgeon immediately. It might be a stricture which is developing. Regards -
Patient: I recently had a rusty nail puncture my hand between my fingers quite deeply, very little blood when it happened but I could see down inside the puncture wound the bits inside. I went to the hospital where they washed my hand in iodine and glued me back together also had my first tetanus jab. now the swelling has mostly subsided I am experiencing shooting pains up along my fingers and a crunching sound in my jaw. the pain in my fingers is quite substantial. do I need an xray to see if any damage has been done  Doctor: Hi, I value your concern regarding the symptoms. I have gone through your symptoms, and in my opinion you should first take Tab Tramadol 100 mg to relieve you of your pain, then an X-Ray is a must to see if there is any phalanges fracture. Also I would recommend a short course of antibiotics to prevent any infection from the injury. Hope this answers your question. If you have additional questions or follow-up questions then please do not hesitate in writing to us. I will be happy to answer your questions. Wishing you good health. Special note-Any medication prescribed needs to be taken after consultation with your personal doctor only.
Patient: Hi Im 36 weeks pregnant, I have had a kidney stone since 8 weeks and now I have a urinary tract infection, on antibiotics but not feeling any better. I get massive cramping like Im on my period and sharp stabbing pains in my cervix. It has been going on for about a month now. I have a doctors appointment tomorrow is this something he might consider inducing me over?  Doctor: Hi and thanks for the query, Other considerations are requires taking a decision to induce or not, and this could not be an absolute indication. The fact that you have been on anti biotherapy shall require that the presence of infection be evaluated, and that clinical signs of endometriosis (uterine), which are actually absent in your case, be considered. These is actually indirect clinical measures of threats to infecting the fetus and possibility of causing of premature labor. If the results of the obstetric ultrasound are normal and there are absences of the signs of urinary tract infection, there would actually be no need to induce. If you still continue being seriously in pain, or there is a risk on the baby depending on given clinical and para clinical criteria, the physician might decide to induce. However, induction in this case under appropriate medical supervision is very safe since the fetus is already greater than 34 weeks. I suggest a clinical evaluation is required, but there is no need to panic. Generally, after birth, symptoms greatly improve. Thanks and best regards, Luchuo, MD.
Patient: Dear Sir or Maddam. I have a situation i understand you can not help me with dental issues but it is just to explain to you how i got where im at now. As we speak i am unable to eat anything by mouth. I have a Dr willing to prescribe some home health care for me for some physical therapy and iv nutrician because of a possible eating disorder that i have developed due to everything that has been gpoing on in the past few months. I have servere Agroaphobia, social anxiety, PTSD, and panic attacks so as we speak i am notable to leave my home. my kids are with my mom because right now physically im not able to take care of them. Dfacs has a home parenting aid that comes out on a weekly basis, and i have been working with a CBT on-line councelor for a little over 2 months now. I have lost alot of weight gone from 289lbs to 215lbs since the end of June because I am unable to eat, I dont really have an appetite. I can small food think oh yummy and not eat. I am very weak because I have lost so much weight. I have some mobile atrophy going on, i am unable to climb the stairs or even remotely able to get out of bed because of how much weight i have lost it causes shortness of breathe if if i sit up or try to walk. Parts of my belly are numb because of how immobilzed i am, I am needing some in-home physical therapy and iv nutrician to get my strength back up. I can not do a peg feeding tube because of my attacks or i would so i have been told doing iv nutrician would be the best way to get it back up to where i can feel better in order to go back on my medications, stil work with the CBT therapist and the parent aid, and the dentist that is going to be working with me on a new guard for my TMJ. My nurse practionier is willing to do PPN (in-home iv nutrician threw the home health,) but she does not know enough about the dosages to write the script to have it done. She asked me to contact the Atlanta center for eating disorders to see if there is a nutricionist that can possibly help us in writing the orders and helping us with this. I do not want to be hospitalized because my agrophobia is to servere and I am willing to go back on the meds and continue to work with the therapist that i currently have. We have talked with several People an this is in the best interest right now. The in-home care told us that they can come out and administer the Iv nutrician and monitor it and help me with physical therapy to get back on my feet so that i can get some strength and be able to care for my kids again. Here is my story below: was told to contact your office by several local dentist and the dental association because of my situation i have agraoaphobia social anxiety and panic attacks that makes it impossible to leave my home as we speak. i am needing someone to come to my home and evaluate my situation. i have panaramic xrays an teeth impressions etc if needed. i am really trying to find some help the thing is i have agarophibia so i cant leave my home i have a friend in another state that went threw the same thing as me and due to her situation they went to her instead of her going to them,.the mobile dental clicn that went to her was a kids one also but shes 36 they just charged her out of pocket which is fine with me just in order to get some help i know thats asking alot but in certain suituations you just work together i supose. anyways here is my situation i desperately need some help because its effecting my breathing an my swallong. several months ago i was in my bath tub an i had yawned really big an my jaw had popped i immediately noticed alot of fullness in my ears when i would sit up or try to walk i would feel dizzy an almost feel like i was going to fall over, i went to see my dr thinking it was a ear infection that came on all of a sudden but it wasnt. i look up on the net for about 2 weeks and came across TMJ so I tried a sports guard at first to see if it would help at all it did at first, then i moved to a denteck boil an bite because it wasnt as thick. then i had seen online that you can buy the acrlic ones so you dont have to keep getting the boil an bite ones, so i got the kit did the impressions an about aweek later got the guard, i wore it 24/7 for a good month, my dr wanted me to go on lexapro an xanax for the agraphobia, social anxiety, panic attacks so i started that but eventually had to come of it. i noticed my breathing was different an my bite possibly, where i couldnt get a full breathe of air from my mouth or when i would breathe threw my nose, i was havign air come from the back of my throat when i would breathe threw my nose, and from my ears at times.i had several ekg s done, an blood work my white blood cells came basck elevated the dr wanted me on zithromax but she couldnt tell me what we were treating where i got it from where it was in my bpody oranything.. so i didnt even take it i read that stress can cause your ewbc count to go up too i came off of the acrlic mouth guard an went back on the denteck one to basically wheen myself off the acrlic one. i have had ekgs, blood work, xrays at a chiropractor remind you my breathing did not change or my swallowing until AFTER this mouth guard is there ANYWAY possible it could of changed my bite or my jaw to where it if effecting my breathing an swallowing, the swallowing is bascailly not tight but its where im having to struggle to swallow at times. or ill cough until i burp. IF this is my bite/jaw causing this can it be corrected to where it goes back to normal agagain i have panaramic xrays avalible, and teeth impressions avbalible also. my dr an i believe that i jumped to soon into gettinmg the acrlic guard offline because i had no insurance at the time and was looking for somethiong more permernt. i got the impressions about a week later got the guard it was pretty snug at first for the first week or so, then it started to even out, i wore it 24/7 for entire month an thern started to notice the breathing differences, i stopped using it for about 2 weeks an started having swallowing issues, i started the guard back it was snug again but evened out in about a day, and the swallowing issues went away, so needless to say the guard has been causing all of this an i need someone to help me get my bite back in place my jaw has now started poping on the left side when i yawn my dr is willing to talk with you about my situation also i have panaramic xrays and teeth impressions prior to the guard i started to wear thats causing all of this.  Doctor: Hello thanks for asking from Chat Doctor I have read your detailed explanation of symptoms and can understand your problem. Your main issues are related to mandibular joint (TMJ), dental issues and anxiety. As dental problems coupled with anxiety have resulted in reduced feeding so first I would advise you to get yourself reevaluated to find out any abnormality in dental and TMJ. The problems of agoraphobia, anxiety, PTSD, panic disorder have probably resurfaced because of dental issues. This is the reason for eating disorder. I would advise you to consult a psychiatrist for detailed treatment. Medicines like SSRIs especially Escitalopram, Fluoxetine can help to reduce your problems related to anxiety and will help to control eating disorder. For severe eating disorder you may need feeding tube but as you have normal appetite so as per my opinion there would not be any need for feeding tube. Thanks

Patient: My husband 40y black male has been experiencing chest pains for several days now, His EKG and vital signs are fine at this time. Although, his B/P was 200+/100+ during this episode. Hx: asthma, part of one lung missing or inoperable (according to his mother).  Doctor: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your situation and problem. Since your husband is having high blood pressure, we need to first rule out cardiac cause for his chest pain. So get done1. 2d echo2. Stress test. Many times ECG can be normal, but we can pick up cardiac problem by above 2 investigations. If both of the above are normal then no need to worry about cardiac cause. He is also having asthma and one lung fibrosis. So consult pulmonologist and get done1. Chest x ray2. PUT (pulmonary function test)So better to first diagnose him and then start appropriate treatment.

Patient: If a person has had a left frontotemporal craniotomy several years ago and seems to be functioning fine until being injured in an automobile accident, is it possible that they could have suffered a trauma to the brain without it showing up on the Head CT scan that was performed in the ER?  Her head hit the windshield.  The CT shows status post left frontotemporal craniotomy, with associated encephalomalacia.    This encephalomalacia causes ex vacuo dilatation of the left lateral ventricle, and some subtle right-to-left midline shift.  No acute abnormality seen.  This individual had an aneurysm about 20 years ago.  Doctor: Hi, Thank you for posting your query. In most cases of severe head injury, CT scan of brain would show abnormalities. So, if the CT does not show any acute abnormalities, then, it is unlikely she has suffered any serious internal brain injury. The findings reported in the current CT represents the old changes. Please get back if you require any additional information. Best wishes, Chat Doctor. Ly/

Patient: My friend has multiple symptoms of prinzmetal s angina. His family doc told him everything was normal, yet he continues to experience symptoms. As a last resort someone gave him some nitro pills and the chest pain subsided. His doctor has him on metoprolol and we have read that drug can increase the severity and frequency of the chest pain. Tonight he has mild chest pain and a headache that he claims is nearly debilitating and coming in waves across the left side of his head. He also claims his vision in the left eye is intermittently blurred with the headache. Please advise  Doctor: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. No, metoprolol is not causing worsening of symptoms or chest pain in printzmetal angina. In fact, metoprolol is one of the treatment option for angina. Honestly speaking, I think your friend is having uncontrolled stress and anxiety related symptoms. Since his heart work up is normal, no need to worry about angina or other heart related symptoms. In my opinion, he should consult psychiatrist and get done counselling sessions. Try to identify stressor in his life and start working on its solution. He may need anxiolytic Chat Doctor.  Don't worry, with counselling and anxiolytic
Patient: I am a 53 year old female. For the last couple of months I have been getting hard lumps under the skin under both of my armpits. When I squeeze them they are very painful but nothing comes out except blood . One will go away but shortly after I find another. At the present time, I have 2 under my left arm and 1 under my right arm. Could this be cancer?  Doctor: Hi abhart, no this is not a cancer, these are simple boils due to pulling of hairs. You can use ibuprofen plus paracetamol or diclofenac plus paracetamol combination for pain. Also do not try to squeeze them. If pus present use antibiotics for it.

Patient: Hi, Ive noticed this newly developed and very weird (but probably insignificant) sensation i get when i swallow food sometimes (especially food that i like) in my chest. Its a lot like the feeling you get when you are nervous or suddenly frightened, like as if your hearts skipping a beat. Was wondering if I should have it checked? [Im a 25yr old male] Thank you for the help  Doctor: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Fluttering sensations in chest with skipping of beats in young patient are commonly seen with arrhythmia (rhythm disturbances in heart). If not treated promptly, arrhythmia can be life-threatening. So we should first rule out arrhythmia in your case. So consult doctor and get done ECG, 2d echo and Holder monitoring (24 hours continuous recording of ECG). If all these are normal then no need to worry about arrhythmia or other heart diseases. Sometimes stress and anxiety can also cause similar symptoms. So avoid stress and tension, be relaxed and calm. Don't worry, you will be alright but first rule out arrhythmia. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.

Patient: Hi, a friend has several lumps on the left side of the neck, and behind the ear, and now she has two on her left shoulder. She is in pain, and she was taking antibiotics and morphine pills. The Dr. doesnt know what it is. Unfortunately, thats all the information I have.  Doctor: Hi, Thanks for asking. Based on your clinical history and query, my opinion is as follows:1. Lumps on the side of neck and behind the ear are most often secondary to infection in the oropharynx or ear. 2. It usually settles with the control of primary infection with antibiotics.3. If it persists or is bothering then you can get a fine needle aspiration cytology done to find out the possible nature of lesion.4. However, multiple lymph node enlargement needs to be evaluated to rule out any lymphoproliferative disorder. Hope it helps. Any further queries, happy to help again.

Patient: I have not had a drink in 24 hours but have a horrible pain in the middle of my chest that goes thru to my back and under my arms. it is hard to breathe. I slept most of the day to get rid of my hangover and now have this pain. its pretty bad. I drank some mylanta thinking it was heartburn it did not help. any other ideas?  Doctor: You should seek medical attention immediately. Pain like this can be serious and causes can include tear of the esophagus due to damage by alcohol and vomiting or an ulcer in the stomach. It can also be a tear in a blood vessel or a heart related problem. You should go to the emergency room to have these symptoms evaluated and exclude serious causes. Best of luck.

I reviewed your query and here is my answer. Your ultrasound report is normal except for liver size, the normal liver size is from 11-13 cm or some take 14 cm as normal but yours is 16 cm, also it is fatty which means you may have fatty liver which occurs in obese people or people who take high fat diet mostly. However, you need to talk to your doc about increase liver size but if you have no other problem then taking control of your diet may bring it to the normal. Take low fat diet and have a good exercise daily. Hope I answered your query, feel free to ask if you need further assistance.  Thanks. Regards. Chat Doctor. G.P

Though I do not have any issue as to urine but bad breath is there. Can you provide me contact details as well where i can get treated for this problem . I stay in Pune. Is there any hospital / clinic in pune which can offer treatment to me.  Doctor: Hi, You should understand that matador is caused by many reasons like decayed teeth, poor oral hygiene, gastric problems, Sinusitis, liver disorder, diabetes, smoking, alcohol consumption, tobacco chewing. If the problem is due to calculus and plaque it can be removed by scaling and polishing of your teeth. Flossing of teeth and tongue cleaning using tongue scraper should be done daily. Any systemic problem should be identified by a physician and appropriate treatment for it should be obtained.
Patient: my son is 6 years old, he weighs 50 lbs and has always been on the normal but thin side and is very active. He has been complaining of his stomach hurting and feeling sick he has always been good to eat well balanced diet he complains of yucky burps and has frequent bathroom stops for both urinating and bowels. He says he is thirsty all the time and drinks frequently through the day and before sleep several times. Should I be concerned of diabetes; type 2 runs in family.  Doctor: Hi, welcome to this forum. Can understand your concerns.* Symptoms of stomach pain and burps suggest that most probably your child has stomach infection like acute gastroenteritis, acute gastritis or stomach upset.* In type 2 Diabetes mellitus, there are symptoms like increase in thirst, increased urination, increased appetite. Since there is history of type 2 diabetes in family, I suggest you to get blood sugar levels in child.* Pain abdomen and increased frequency of urination does not seem to be related to each other. You should also do urine routine microscopy and culture test so that if any infection is causing pain abdomen or increased urination then it can be ruled out.* Prebiotic like enterogermina ampule should be given once a day for 3 days to increase intestinal immunity. * An examination by doctor should be done so that we may not miss any important finding point.  * Review back with above reports. I hope this will help you. Wishing your child good health. Take care.
Patient: I have a mild pain on what appears to be my left vas deferens. What would the causes of that be? I also noticed that the pain reflects in my left testicle. Additionally, when I press on it, I feel that it goes back to my left kidney. Thank you in advance for your answer.  Doctor: Good Day, and thank you for being with Chat Doctor ! Pain in the vas deferens could be because of infection medically called orchids if the infection is in the testis and epididymitis if it is in the epididymis. This presents as pain and marked swelling in the affected area. Another differential diagnosis would be varicocele. This is abnormal enlargement and dilation of the veins in the spermatic cord (the structure that connects the testis to the ejaculatory ducts located in the prostate). This presents as no swelling but enlargement of the spermatic cord especially during straining and Valhalla maneuvers. This can be confirmed by doing a scrotal ultrasound with Doppler studies. I hope I have succeeded in providing the information you were looking for. Please feel free to write back to me for any further clarifications at: http://www.ChatDoctor .com/doctors/ Chat Doctor.  Best wishes.
Patient: Hello, I have swelling on the left side of my neck (only that side) about an inch posterior to the top of my lower jaw, I believe it is my lymph node, it is tender when touched and rather firm, I was wondering if you could diagnose it. My forehead is slightly hot throughout the day; I smoke quite frequently and daily, if that contributes at all. Thanks.  Doctor: Hi there swollen lymph nodes are sign of infection or inflammation somewhere in the region of that lymph nodes. It can be also a sign of a sinister disease called lymphoma, but it will be usually more than one swollen lymph node. It is not related to smoking. I suggest you see a doctor for a thorough check-up.

Patient: right leg is swollen on one side...went to dr. had ultrasound done of my leg to check for blood clot and its nothing. Im currently almost 10 weeks pregnant with my second child. My right leg was swollen yrs ago, same spot, same leg, and ultrasound showed no blood clots. I am on my feet at work and constantly moving around. I am worried that this is something serious even though ultrasound showed no blood clots  Doctor: Hi, as you have mentioned the little of the history and diagnostic procedures performed. I feel you should try doing leg exercises. Try dipping the leg in warm water for 15 minutes then Keep the leg over the pillow while lying on your back. That means the leg is elevated above the level of heart to get venous Chat Doctor.  Also perform some simple exercise like ankle toe movements and straight leg raise. During pregnancy swelling is common and can be avoided by some simple exercises. I don't think there is serious issue where you have to worry. If the symptoms persists talking to a gone or a gone physical therapist will be of great input. Thank you

Patient: hello,i waana ask abt my father...actually his skin test for tb infection came negative,then sputum test too was negative,after bronchoscopy doctor went for sputum culture ,there in the 6th week they fond the tb bacteria...although my father is absolutely fine ..no cough ,no sputum problem could u pls tell me that how much the report is reliable  Doctor: Hello, I understand the confusion that this situation can create, although it is not uncommon in TB. A skin test cannot reliably diagnose an active TB infection and thus a negative test does not rule out tuberculosis. Sputum can often diagnose tuberculosis, but when sputum samples are insufficient, bronchoscopic samples may be collected by a physician. These samples are far more accurate and reliable than simple sputum samples. A positive culture for TB from a bronchoscopic sample is very reliable and indicates infection with tuberculosis. The only important caveat is that the TB culture can sometimes pick up other bacteria as well. The "AFB" (Acid fast bacilli) culture can start growing bacteria that look like TB but are different bacteria (nontuberculous Mycobacteria). You should ask the doctor if the result so far is positive for Acid Fast Bacilli or for Tuberculosis. It takes a bit of time to be able to identify the organism is true TB after the initial detection of Acid Fast Bacilli. I hope this clears things up a little.
Patient: My husband had a spinal cord injury in Sept. 2013 which left him paralyzed and unable to urinate on his own for one month. He is now walking with a cane and can urinate on his own but still not properly. He is on Flomax to help. He is also on water pills because his legs will swell up. An emg showed nerve damage. My question is his shins are very shiny and they occasionally blister or split open even when his legs do not look swollen. This is a great concern to me. Even though he does not work or walk around like he used to, he is certainly not sitting around all day like he was when he was first injured. Any ideas?

Patient: I had a stress test last sunday, below were the findings: left posterior hemiblock, intraventricular conduction defect, right axis deviation, sinus arrhythmia and insignifican ST-T changes. What do you mean by these? my email addresses are: YYYY@YYYY and YYYY@YYYY  Doctor: Sinus arrhythmia means that heart beats rapidly and irregularly. Right Axis Deviation means tilting of electrical axis of heart to right when left half heart is affected as in your condition. During stress test, your heart could not cope up to meet the exercise demands. Here, heart has difficulty in conducting the impulse generated. Kindly consult cardiologist to rule out mechanical defect in heart by ECHO.

It appears from your query that you have post acne scars after pimples. It is quite common to find such kind of marks after pimples. In all your kind of cases I generally go for either medical treatment with Retinoid cream or with glycolic acid based creams. In other of the patients I use chemical peeling as main therapy with various peels such as Trichloroacetic acid or Glycolic acid. In resistant cases I also use fractional laser as last and best resort to take care of the condition. All the best.
Patient: My wife (30yr old) has completed three rounds of Chemotherapy between August and November last year with induction chemo bringing with it remission. She has not had a BMT or SCT. Lately she has been very fatigued and has stomach and bone pain . She had her period last week and thought that it had stopped three day ago. We had intercourse last night and she had some minor red bleeding . Should we be concerned? The reason this scares me a little is that this is what happened a few days before her initial diagnosis.  Doctor: The signs are alarming, and she needs thorough investigations to rule out any recurrence of cancer and metastasis. Also get her blood counts done immediately.
Patient: My 14 yr old daughter had gallbladder surgery Oct 17th and was 3 weeks prior without being able to keep food down since her original symptoms are gone but she is feeling HOT and dizzy and nearly blacking out when standing I was wondering if this could be from the GA or is this typical?  Doctor: Hi.... this is not typical but at the same time I do not think that it is due to general anesthesia. The symptoms which your daughter is experiencing are due to autonomic imbalance. She needs evaluation for this. I suggest you consult a pediatrician regarding this or even better choice would be a pediatric Endocrinologist. Regards -
Patient: 1 day i masterbated 19 times continously and after that i had very intense pain in my belly or kidney area? since that day their is smthing wrong with me now my sperm color is yellow instead of white nd recently they have become thinner like a transparent liquid and i feels all the time pain in my belly testes and in my knees what to do i think their went sm thing very bad with me  Doctor: Degree understand your concerns went through your details. I suggest you not to worry much. Astonishing that you managed to masturbate 19 times in a single day! I am amazed. But that is totally wrong. The pain could be explained as strain to the muscles of those areas which are used more for masturbation. Coupled with anxiety associated with frequent masturbation, it made you more anxious and more and more anxious. Forget about the thinness of semen. That area is dependent on so many factors. If your semen is really yellow, and you still have the pain you mentioned, please consult a physician. Please post a direct question to me in this website. Make sure that you include every minute details possible. I shall prescribe some psychotherapy techniques for sexological problems which should help you cure your condition. Hope this answers your query. Available for further clarifications. Good luck.
Patient: i am 19yrs old, my weight is 65kg, my height is 5.4inches. i suffered OCD 3yrs before. i read an article in a paper n was thinking k what it it happened to me? that made me irritable and frustated. i took medication with the consultation of psychiatrist in KEM hospital. the OCD have reduced to a great extent or you can say vanished. now, since, five months i am getting anxiety attacks. the first attack i got was in March, i got the thought of suicide. i took medicine n got better, but now again i got that anxiety attack 3 weeks back. doctor told me that it is because of NEUROTRANSMITTER IMBALANCES IN BRAIN, medication is on but still i am not perfectly well. i hope u can understand how bad m feeling, i get feared WITHOUT ANY REASON. i feel i should die so that my suffering will be at an end. i am searching for a PERMANENT SOLUTION to whatever i am suffering (OCD OR ANXIETY). i want a fast, effective an PERMANENT SOLUTION for this so that i wil not suffer this again ever in my life and be a happy person as i was earlier...  Doctor: Hi.thanks for your query. For finding an effective & long-lasting cure to your problems I need to know that what set of symptoms you had which were diagnosed as OCD & at present what medications you are receiving. It is true that almost all Psychiatric illness including OCD are because of some neurotransmitter abnormalities in brain. For effective treatment I usually advocate medicines plus certain lifestyle changes like sleeping min 6-7 hrs every night, doing at least 30 minutes daily physical exercises like cardio, resistance training along with Yoga, Panama which promote mental health. Depending upon your symptoms of anxiety & their triggers, we can plan out certain behavior modification techniques known as exposure & response prevention which are known to increase medication effectiveness & hasten cure. Lastly you can visit a website www.nimhans.kar.nic where you can find a very useful patient resource about OCD. You can always get back to me for any further clarification. Good luck
Patient: I am a 52-year-old woman, 155 pounds, 5 7 , and I have several health issues, but one that remains a mystery, and that is extremely uncomfortable, is the discomfort I have in my upper abdomen when I exert myself. This is a sensation of extreme pressure in the area of my diaphragm, like I am having the wind knocked out of me, and is most extreme when I am climbing stairs or doing anything that elevates my heart rate. I can no longer do aerobic activity because of it, and I would like to be able to work my body, but this condition won t allow it. This sensation occurs right in the middle, just underneath my ribs. It feels like my stomach has been replaced with a brick--it feels weighty. I also get mildly nauseated, and it doesn t matter if I have eaten or not. It happens on an empty stomach as much as it does on a full stomach. It feels as if I ve eaten a huge meal and can t catch my breath, even if I haven t. There is also pain that I would rate anywhere between a 3 and a 6. The pain can also extend to closer to where the pancreas is, and while I have had a few cases of acute pancreatitis in the past, my blood work has not shown to be positive for it since 1996. The other mysterious thing that nobody seems to have an answer to is that I wake up in the morning with a thin lower torso, but I put a few inches on in fluid throughout the day. This is not ascites - it is all in the tissue, under the skin, surrounding my abdomen and back. This has happened every single day for the last five years, and is also worse upon exertion. High temperature can bring it on and exacerbate it too. It s so frustrating, and I have been called a hypochondriac numerous times. I was even yelled at by an ER physician when I went in with extreme PACs and a combo of bradycardia & tachycardia that wouldn t abate - something that occurs a few times a year and that makes me have to go into the ER for i.v. Lopressor. These are the things I know for sure (and I ve been tested for many, many things). I have Fibromyalgia, Osteoporosis, Ptosis (which is worse first thing in the morning but usually goes away after time), and I sometimes get these little painful blisters on my upper abdomen, under breasts, on my knees and elbows. They are red and full of liquid and very painful. They last just one or two days, and then they are little painful scabs. They flare up fairly often - usually I get them once or twice a month. Cholesterol is 240 (I ve brought it down from 283 with diet change and fish oil). I have some connective tissue issues (hypermobility and possibly Ehlers Danlos, which my daughter was diagnosed with too) and possibly Sjogren s Syndrome (Schirmer test result is 0 and I get frequent salivary gland pain and swelling, very dry mouth, and several other symptoms) although ANA tests are negative. I had a spot removed from my chest which was positive for Lupus, however, a subsequent biopsy on normal skin from the same area was negative. I also have frequent inflammation of the medial epicondyle and it s quite painful, and painful swelling in other joints. Tests for inflammation are also negative but I was diagnosed with arthritis. I have, what a couple doctors have called Myotonia, but others dispute it. When I squeeze my hand tightly for several seconds, then relax, my fingers stay gripped. They will relax over time, or I can open them with my other hand. The doctor who diagnosed it was a primary care physician, and she observed my daughter and I both showing her, and she used the little hammer and tapped on the muscle near my thumb, which caused the thumb to cramp up. However, muscle testing was negative. I get a combination of PACs, bradycardia, and tachycardia, that leaves me unable to function because I have near-syncope when it happens. I have had three major episodes in the last twelve months or so that required ER trips and i.v. Lopressor to fix it. The first time it happened that extreme was in February of 2012 and I ve had three like that since. They don t know why it happens, but I ve had heart rhythm issues for years. An ablation didn t fix it. I have frequent flare-ups that leave me unable to perform daily tasks or work on a regular basis so I have had to go on disability, which I hate. I would like to have my life back. I would also like to find a doctor who can help me figure out this mystery, which has robbed me of so much time. I can t do the things I used to do and I am kind of afraid of the daily edema, which is uncomfortable in itself. I want to find a doctor who will not look at me like I m a freak who is making it all up. I m not. Here are some pictures of the edema in my torso. You can also see pictures of the Ptosis and blisters if you go up to the top and click on the heading. WWW.WWWW.WW  Doctor: Hi ma'am, Thanks for your query. I have gone through your detailed query very thoroughly. I am of the strong conviction that you are indeed suffering from MYOTONIC DYSTROPHY, since the majority of your problems fit into this condition. Furthermore, I will try to solve most of your problems, if not all. Firstly, the heaviness in the center of chest and upper abdomen with minimal exertions; swelling of the lower torso during the day, is STRONGLY suggestive of failing of the entire heart along with co-existing coronary artery disease. Investigations like 2-D Echo, stress TMT/Thallium test and coronary angiography will confirm my views. Medicines like digoxin, diuretics, low-dose alpha-beta blockers (such as carvedilol), coronary vasodilators in adequate doses and ACE inhibitors in titrated doses will certainly help you. Further, the tachycardia-bradycardia syn Chat Doctor.
Patient: hi :(im mohammad / 18 years oldi have Schistosomiasis since 3 years or morebut i didnt go to a doctor ... now i think from this Schistosomiasis i got Bladder Cancer :(as i read according to info i read in internetmy question ... is there a cure for Bladder Cancer ???and what is the percent to get health againthank you  Doctor: Hi and thank you for this query. Schistosomiasis increases the risk of having bladder cancer but doesn't mean you have got bladder cancer for sure. Please get consulted by a urologist and find out what is going on exactly. This will enable you know whether it has led to any bladder lesions or not before choosing an appropriate treatment plan for you. If it were bladder cancer for sure, we would need a comprehensive evaluation with tests like CT scan of the pelvis, cystoscopy(look into the bladder with a magnifying light source), etc. to evaluate the stage. Treatment options and cure rate depend on the stage. However, most persons with early disease often get a complete cure. Hope you find this informative and helpful. If you have more questions, please keep them coming. I wish you well.
Patient: I am a 31 year old female. I am currently taking nortrel 28 birth control and spironolactone, both for PCOS. I am not over weight, I am very active and I eat a healthy diet.Recently I started having right side lower abdominal pain. It was quite bothersome for several hours, for three consecutive days. I also noticed that my mood swings increased ten fold.  I started my period and everything subsided for a day or two.  I woke up in the middle of night and the stomach pain was back and I had blood in my stool twice this morning. Any idea what could be going on?  Doctor: Hi, For persistent pain located to the right Iliad fossa, the possibilities include ovarian enlargement mostly due to cysts, constipation and bloating, chronic appendicular inflammation, premenstrual pain due to engorgement, and pelvic infection. Mood swings are usually due to the hormonal surges prior to the onset of menstruation. Blood in stool can be due to local causes if it is fresh. These include mostly fissures and hemorrhoids. Bleeding higher up alters the color of the blood to black or greenish black. Passage of hard stool can erode the mucosa and can lead to bleeding. Infections also can lead to fresh bleeding associated with diarrhea. Hope this helps.
Patient: Hi Doctor Grief,Im facing the removal of my prostate due to cancer and a Gleason score of 7. During the surgery what else is removed besides the prostate? What happens to the Ductus Deferens? Is the plumbing arranged to allow ejaculate to mix with urine so that when I orgasm the discharge will be mostly urine? Can this be prevented?Thanks for help.Regards, Walter Kimball  Doctor: Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor. No, Vas deferens are not removed. There is a change in ejaculatory volume. This related to retrograde ejaculation. After removal of prostate, semen enters the bladder instead of being propelled forward to penis during ejaculation. The semen is then evacuated from the bladder with the next urination. Hope this helps. Take care.

As per your age and history there is possibility of soft tissue injury in knee. Most commonly meniscus injury occurs may be associated collateral ligament injury. If pain persists then you may need to do MRI knee to see for any functional defect. As per your symptoms you need to do physiotherapy and knee exercises to improve range of motion. Rest and ice fomentation along with supportive brace will help to reduce swelling and pain. Small meniscus tear can be managed conservatively with physiotherapy with USG and TENS. Meniscus injury can be managed by arthroscopic repair. Hope this answers your query. If you have additional questions or follow-up queries then please do not hesitate in writing to us. I will be happy to answer your queries. Wishing you good health. Take care.
Patient: Hi. I had a car accident around 2 years ago and had to have a titanium rod put in my right leg. The screws feel like they are coming out causing bruising and my leg constantly burns. What is causing this and how to I make it stop? It s preventing me from having a life. I can t work because if this.  Doctor: Hi, A titanium rod left in the leg for 2 years would not be causing an acute allergic reaction because the area would have had a long time to heal. However, there may irritation every time you hit any object with the rods or the screws.  This may happen when you bump the rod area into a table, chair, or any object. When this happens, a small swelling may start. This swelling can grow larger and continue to irritate the area.  Many people find icing the area useful to help reduce the swelling. Usually, it is best to ice the area for about 15 mins every hour till the area of swelling and pain numbs and the pain reduces.  In case this does not help, many people find using Over the Counter painkillers useful as well. However, if all these do not help, seeing a doctor for imaging may be needed.  Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.
Patient: Hi I have had a rash , with severe itching for more than 5 weeks now, i am plastered with Pimples , perhaps hives may be a better name, from my feet to my neck, my first GP said a severe allergy , the next hid behind his desk and said scabies , he gave me a RX for melathion off the market for years, thenPermathin, the chemist said there was NO way it was scabies, i sleep in the same bed as my wife, she has helped me pout the cream on, and has no sign of the infection. I saw the remaining GP who said he did not know so would give me the same as GP no 2, i am still itching severerly, and bleeding through my scratching, heat affects me terribly, can you help me please i am desperate.  Doctor: Hello dear, as correctly mentioned by you, it is hives. That is urticaria. This is an allergic disorder, you must be sensitized to some particular thing which you wear, or some change in food etc. There is no permanent cure to this, you must find out the cause, that is to what thing you are allergic. That will be the only cure. For symptomatic relief you may take antihistamine like cetirizine.thank you

Patient: Hi Doctor My wife is suffering from a low back pain since last year. All of the tests suggested by the doctors are normal. Even then also the pain is there. Exact position of the pain is lower back left side. Please let me know in case any other details required Thanks Mani Goel  Doctor: Hello, This could be related to muscle weakness which is leading postural changes. Due to postural changes, there will be joint compression leading to pain. Undergoing physiotherapy sessions will be helpful to reduce the pain. Exercises like - core stability, hip muscle strengthening exercises and lower limb strengthening exercises will help to regain muscle strength and stability of the spine.

Patient: Hi, please help! I am suffering tooth abcesses which has caused me to have 2 teeth extracted. Though the pain I am in, is still horrendous! My jaw is constantly aching and throbbing (burning sensations and sharp shooting pains on my left jaw) I don t know what else I can do. At a dead end with the dentist . Is there anything a doctor can do. (I have had to visit the doctors for a sick note, due to do much time off work) I am only 27 and frightened that nothing is going to help. I have been on 4 lots of antibiodics and constantly taking pain killers.  Doctor: Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor forum, I would like to inform you that pain in jaw following extraction needs a thorough examination y your dentist, I would advise you to see an oral surgeon for the same. Until you visit a dentist, kindly perform warm saline rinses(3-4 times/day), antibacterial mouth wash(twice/day), Do not worry, your dentist will take an ,x-ray to make sure no other tooth is causing these symptoms.I hope I answered your query, i wish you good health.
Patient: my husband has advance prostate cancer for 3 years, recently he s been on new drug Abieraterone for 6 months, all stabled untill now, he has bruises appeared on his hands and legs for no resons and a little tired then normal! please can you tell why? is it urgent to be seen by oncologist asap? thank you.?  Doctor: Bruises without trauma usually indicates an underlying clotting insufficiency. It can be due to low platelet count (platelets are responsible for clotting blood). Although abiraterone is not known for decreasing blood cell count, but this possibility should be ruled out. The other possibility is prostate cancer progression affecting marrow and blood counts. The tiredness can be secondary to disease progression OR mineralocorticoid deficiency or hypokalemia (low potassium levels) associated with abiraterone. Please discuss this with your treating oncologist. An early appointment is suggested.
Patient: I have red bumps showing up all over my body. They are very sore, filled with blood and puss, warm and hard to the touch. It takes about a week for it to scab up. One will pop up and a few days later another one appears. They are pretty big. What could this be?  Doctor: Hello, Welcome to ChatDoctorThanks for posting your query in Chat Doctor. Your symptoms are most probably suggestive of Staphylococcal infections. It is usually caused by bacterium Staphylococcus aureus. It may be a boil or folliculitis. Staphylococcal folliculitis affects hair follicles on the face, scalp, neck, trunk or limbs but not the hands, soles and mucous membranes where there are no hair follicles. Folliculitis usually appears as a group of red bumps, which may develop into pus-filled blisters. I would advise you to go for topical antibacterial treatment like Juridic acid and mupirocin. Treatment should last up to 10 days. To prevent getting such infections, follow these measures:1. Regularly wash hands, avoid nose picking, nails biting and skin scratching.2. Wear fresh, comfortable, airy clothes.3. Do not share razors, towels, clothes, bed lining with others. Thank you

I have a common birth condition where the blood flow in is great but out slow and narrowed.  Didnt go to the hospital  due to stress I believeIs this a sign of something to come?  Looking for a cardiologist  Doctor: Hello dear user! Thank you for choosing Chat Doctor. I have gone through your medical history and understand your concerns! I would like to know some more information to have a closer view of your situation.- What is your age?- Are you a regular smoker?- Are you overweight?- Have your parents or other familiars any history of hypertension? It is true that in women who take contraceptives for birth control may be affected by high blood pressure especially if they are overweight and smoker. If you have familiar history of high blood pressure this is more likely to happen to you. I would suggest you to quit contraceptive Chat Doctor.  Having abnormal levels once or twice doesn't mean you have to take antihypertensive
Patient: I was reading Dr Js posting and I wish to God I could find a doctor like him. Why are all the docs so afraid to give it out? I have Crohn s Disease, GAD, my baby died when he was not even 4 months old, and among many many other really good reasons for needing it ......I just found out my dad has lung cancer that has made a happy little home in his brain....and it brought the whole family....7 lesions total. The healthcare system is falling apart.  Doctor: Hi, Sorry to hear about your family. Thanx for the query. Lung cancer treatment depends on stage of the disease. In early surgery +/- radiation therapy is the treatment. In advanced cases treatment is surgery/radiation therapy and chemotherapy. In metastatic cases patients are treated with chemotherapy. In Crohn's disease surgery and long time medication are needed.
Patient: Can u explain my CTA chest w/ intravenous contrast results? The central airways are patent. There is minimal dependent atelectasis within the lung bases. no focal airspace consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. There is scarring within the right middle lobe no suspicious pulmonary nodule or mass.  Doctor: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. In my opinion you should not worry about this report. As your CT report is normal. Minimal atelectasis in lung bases is a normal variant. No active treatment is required for this. And no need to worry about scarring. As scarring suggest old lesion only. You may have previous pneumonia which healed and produce scarring. So no need to worry with this CT report.
Patient: In reading about the recent trial of the South African Paralympic athlete, I realized that he exhibited the same emotional and irradict behaviors as my adult younger brother.  The rages, threats, paranoia, crying, etc. is just like my brothers behavior. My brother also had numerous orthopedic surgeries as a young child. Is there any correlation between mental health/emotional issues in adults who have had extensive surgeries in childhood? I know you need much more information, but generally, is there some relationship here? As a matter of information, my brother and I are estranged and I have no intention of sharing this discussion with him or anyone else.  Thank you.  Doctor: To answer your question, yes, there is a relation between mental and physical health. Your brother needs therapeutic help immediately
Patient: My neck has been sore for a few day s on the left side. I have also been experiencing eye pain and nose discomfort like with the sinus area, I have a borderline headache. i just noticed that I can feel the vain on my left temple and it is bulging. Is that normal? I have never noticed it before.  Doctor: Dear Sir/Madam have gone through your query and read your symptoms. In my opinion, your symptoms could sign either a headache with temporal arthritis, or tension headache, or you could be suffering from sinus infection and congestion, an examination by a neurologist will greatly help. I hope that answers your query. If you want any more clarification, contact me back.
Patient: I was shot by unknown person on 10 October 13 and the bullet lies at d11,d12 vertebra on right side .i was treated at indian spinal cord centre , vasantkunj Delhi and slowly I am normal except, I feel spongy feet and have limp in my gait,in right leg which I am not able to rectify . Gabamax sr75 is giving abit of relief but I cannot run or. Jump normally.  Doctor: Hi, Thank you for providing the brief history of you. A thorough neuromuscular assessment is advised. As you were shot with a bullet @ D11-D12 vertebral levels on right side, there will be some post effects on the spinal cord nerves and this is leading to the limping gait and spongy feeling of the feel. Now, what medicines you are taking are perfectly fine as per my knowledge. As what you need to focus now is on physiotherapy as to get the neuromuscular retraining for the Gait Mechanism. Also, for the Physiotherapy to work out behind your gait, a thorough Gait assessment is needed and the complete NCV and EMG tests as well to understand the muscle weakness and other anomalies. Usually, in my clinical experience with GAIT disorders physical therapy neuromuscular retraining is advised, and major difference has been watched out. RegardsJay In Chat Doctor.

Patient: I am experiencing a pain in lower left abdominal portion possibly near lymph which transmits to left leg and left back since two and half years. Many investigation including usg, mri have been conducted which shown normal.since last year I am suffering from some skin disorder which started as white patches on my face which is now converted to patches with hair loss from my beard and mustache. And also I have been detected with ulcerative colitis since three months and I am consuming melamine tab for that. At present my esr level is 25. What can be my problem. Is it auto immune system disorder. How can it be cured. What are pathological tests to confirm this. ---mr Rajasekharan, India  Doctor: Hi Rajasekharan. Thanks for your query and an elucidated history. Since you are a diagnosed case of Ulcerative colitis taking Melamine tablets, the cause of pain on the left side of you abdomen is obviously due to colitis. Urine tests may be normal in this condition. The skin disorder is due to fungal infection hence there is a hair loss. Please consult a Dermatologist for further diagnosis and treatment. Yes, there can be an autoimmune disorder, and you need steroid by enema or orally to get a control of the colitis and pain. There are no specific pathological tests to determine this and ESR has no diagnostic value at all. 25 is not very high. So do not bother about is unnecessarily. Consult a Gastroenterologist to get an appropriate treatment and remember this is a problem which can be recurrent. Stress and anxiety play a very large art in causing such problems, hence you have to keep them under control at any cost. Melamine alone may be not sufficient, and you may need an additional treatment

Patient: I have a chest infection, been coughing quite aggressively for 8 days. Been on anti biotics for 4 days. Two days ago my head started to hurt when I cough. Same place. Back left side. It doesn t hurt unless I cough - it is a tender pain. It isn t intense or that bad but does happen everytime I cough. I ve also not slept through the night for 7 days due to coughing.  Doctor: Howell come to ChatDoctorI really appreciate your concern, first this should be infection, so antibiotic is useful else this won't work here, most of the time this could be due to allergic conditions if this is so then no specific treatment needed, while cough ups this action needs great energy and this comes from the chest muscles and phenomenon sometimes becomes painful, but this is nothing to worry, every thing would be fine, take care.

Patient: my breathing isn t right I have to force out my breath and is kinda fast, I can feel my heart beating hard almost in my throat like I have run a mile or so every once in a while I have pain in the back of my left arm , my left thiegh has a spot the size of a baseball that is stinging.and the toes on my left foot is tingling like they are asleep  Doctor: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. In my opinion, we should first rule out bronchitis in your case because you are having breathing difficulty. So get done PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). If this is normal then no need to worry about bronchitis. Get done ECG and 2d echo to rule out cardiac cause because of tachycardia (high pulse rate) and left arm pain. If all are normal then you are mostly having anxiety related symptoms. So consult psychiatrist and get done counseling sessions, try to identify stressor in your life and start working on its solution. You may need anxiolytic Chat Doctor.  So avoid stress and tension. Be relax and calm. Don't worry, you will be alright. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health. Thanks.

Patient: I have been diagnosed with mild splenomegaly with ap span of 14.5 cm, and a 2 mm nodule in the left lower lobe and minimal linear atelectasis or fibrosis within the right middle lobe. A 2mm left lower lobe nodule. Please explain what this means, thanks in advance :))  Doctor: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I want to ask you few questions.1. What symptoms you have?2. Are you having any respiratory symptoms?3. Are you smoker And alcoholic?4. Is there any past history of TB or pneumonia? Mild splenomegaly can be seen in alcoholics. It can be a normal finding in individual too. Or seen in gastrointestinal infection. So no need to worry much for mild splenomegaly. For your CT findings of lung, no need to worry. As linear atelectasis and fibrosis is seen in old infection. 3 mm nodule in left lung is also due to old infection. So if you are asymptotic for chest than no need to worry about this finding. I advise to repeat CT thorax after 6 months and if findings are similar than no need for further CT as it is inactive lesion only.
Patient: hi i stopped taking the cilest pill in august and restarted them in december (but not on 1st day of period) i had a period a week later and never restarted taking them. i had sex all through my period and about a week and a half later what are my chances of becoming pregnant  Doctor: Hello dear, I understand your concern. As per your information there was no regular intake of birth control pills. So the protection from them is not assured. The period days and a week later the period might be considered as safe period where in there are no chances of pregnancy due to unprotected intercourse. But the period after one week of the period might not come under safe period. So as you had unprotected intercourse during that days there might be risk of pregnancy. As the first sign of pregnancy is missed period I suggest you to wait and check for the period. If at all the period is delayed consider doing a urine pregnancy test a week after missed period for accurate results. All other symptoms of pregnancy like nausea, vomitings, increased urination, sore breasts start 2 weeks after missed period in case of pregnancy. So kindly wait and check for the period. If you get the period the presence of pregnancy is ruled out. Hope this helps. Best regards....

Fluids via nasal feed & antibiotics via cannula . O2 levels reduced. Moved from i/c today still experiencing breathing problems. Nasal feed removed. Cannula still in situ. Prognosis?  Doctor: Hi welcome to Chat Doctor forum.  Thanks for choosing Chat Doctor. Forum.  Your baby of 4 days had inhalation of fluid from birthing pool or may be inhalation of amniotic fluid. Baby is in I.C.U. for three days, now shifted to from I.C.U. it means that the baby is out of danger, and O2 levels must have increased.  Residual dyspnea will be there for few days more, due to residual fluids at the base of the lungs. With efficient treatment baby will be fine in few days.  If you feel necessary you can ask the doctor to consult a neonatologist for acute care. As you said baby will be fine.  Wishing the baby a quick and complete recovery.  Best regards.
Patient: I am in constant pain around my rib cage on the left side. It all started with herniated disks in my neck, for which I had a cervical diskectomy in 2000 and now a chiropractor has told me that I have a bulging thoracic disk. Do you think my rib cage pain is from my thoracic spine? Is surgery done for bulging and not herniated disks (if theres a difference)? I also have a constantly cramped muscle in my left shoulder, no matter what I do. Could that be contributing to the pain? I take neurontin and baclofen. I used to also take oxycodone and morphine but they made me so sleepy and out of it that I stopped.  Doctor: Hi, Thank you for posting your query. Disc herniation is uncommon in thoracic regions, however, it can occur, and your symptoms could well be related to that. Surgery is often reserved for severe disc herniation and is not done for disc bulges. As of now, you can continue the same medications, and physiotherapy. If symptoms persist, then, you can get the MRI of thoracic spine done. Based on that, a definitive plan of treatment can be made. I hope it helps, Please get back if you require any additional information. Best wishes, Chat Doctor. Ly/

Patient: My grandfather is about 90 years old and his creatinine value is 3.11.. his urea is 80. His blood pressure is all under control.  what should be done. Especially tell me what diet to follow and what foods to avoid because I thinkIits because of wrong diet the value has gone high..  Doctor: Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor. As a Urologist, I must assure that the urea and creatinine values, show your grandfather has kidney failure. A faulty diet, is not the cause of kidney failure. The most likely cause in an 80-year-old, is an obstructive prostate gland. That will need to be evaluated, with a urine culture, PSA, and an ultrasound scan of the abdomen. Treatment of prostate gland will depend on the reports. Dietary advice is to restrict salt intake to 6gm daily, avoid fresh fruits, coconut water and any potassium rich food. Also try to restrict protein intake more than 40gm daily. When you visit your nephrologist next, meet the dietitian and get the diet sheet. You must check your urea, creatinine, sodium, potassium and uric acid.  You may contact me for any doubts. Chat Doctor. Manga.
Patient: I have brief sharp stabbing pain and random twinges of pain on the right side lower part of my abdomen and I would like to know what the most likely causes are. They said there are no ovarian cysts on the right side what else could it be? The symptoms don t really fall under the stereotypical appendicitis category. Help?  Doctor: Hi. Read and understood that you have pain in the right lower abdomen. They have ruled out ovarian cysts and you don't feel it to be classical appendicitis. The causes can be :Colitis meaning inflation of the large bowel. Nephritis of cecum Lymph node mass Irritable bowel syn Chat Doctor.  It looks that you have undergone Ultrasonography, it does not show many of the problems I mentioned, hence yes need of contrast enhanced CT scan of the whole abdomen. And also needed are proper investigations of blood, urine and stool as guided by a general surgeon after clinical evaluation. This way a proper diagnosis will be made and a curative treatment done.

Patient: two glasses of carrot juice daily, along with regular meal, will cause any disadvantage?(consumed for nearly two months)I asked this question because in this website its given as it may lead to jaundice.Aged 17 years, height 5.1 ft, 42 kgs and no sickness,  Doctor: Thank you for posting query. According to best of my knowledge, carrot juice is beneficial to combat jaundice rather causing it.it's healthy. Carotenemia is NOT jaundice and NOT a disease. It's common in child Chat Doctor. Increased ingestion of carrots may lead to Carotene, a yellowing of the skin caused by eating an excess of certain vegetables. In this condition, a yellowish skin maybe observed BUT it does "NOT" affect the eyes while jaundice (increased bilirubin) affects eyes also-sclera may become yellow in Jaundice. If any further questions, feel free to ask. Health professionals aim to diagnose properly and manage patients according to their limited knowledge. Cure is blessed by the ONE who Created us, whose power and knowledge is unlimited .wish you good health. Regards,

Such type of myalgic may occur due to:- Smoking-High blood pressure-Diabetes- Excessive fatigue or exercise-Decreased level of vitamin D- Some medicines like cholesterol lowering medicines (Statins)- Pre-viral /viral illnesses. In my routine OLD, I prescribe some analgesics like diclofenac 100 mg twice a day which is very helpful.

Patient: i am 58 year old female. i have examined as a mild MR and inducible ischaemia patient. i am under treatment for 6 months under a heart specialist. but till now i have no effect of medicines. there is swelling in my legs every time. my b.p. remains on slightly higher side 150/90 mmhg.what to do?  Doctor: Dear Mrs, You should seriously talk with your doctor to revise your treatment. There is a need to increase blood pressure medications doses or change the treatment. Usually when a patient has inducible ischemia we perform coronary angiography to see how many heart arteries are affected and how is the percentage of the blockage, and the further tactic of treatment of inducible ischemia depends on the results of coronary angiography. So you should also discuss the possibility of coronary angiography with your doctor. About the swelling legs, it can be caused either by heart problems or by medications or leg vessels problems. Your doctor should examine you thoroughly to find out the cause, as the treatment depends on the cause. Take fearsome back if you have any further questions

Patient: I am a 44 year old female with large blister clusters that are very painful and extremely itchy that are on only my right buttock.   These have been recurring since I was 16 years old. These blister patches originally appeared only on the right side of my nose under my eye...sometimes affecting my vision.  But they eventually have stopped coming to my face and now appear in the same general area on my right buttock. I was originally diagnosed by an ER Dr as a spider bite., then at 35 was diagnosed as possibly having Haley - Haley disease, but I was not tested as this disease is genetic. So the treatment is usually a hydrocortisone cream.  My question is ... What does this sound like?  Are there any good treatments for this? Is this life threatening at all...can this form on internal organs?  Doctor: Hi The treatment for Hailey disease is usually to keep the area free of infections. Avoid trauma, keep the area Chat Doctor.  Some other treatments that have been used are laser, dermabrasion and skin graft. It is not life-threatening. It does not show up on internal organs.

Patient: I am in pain, infected wisdom teeth. I have antibiotics from yesterday but the swelling is the same. Yesterday I was also told that I have high prolactin  level and I might have some tumor thats easily treated with some drugs. Is my infection caused by this and could it get worse? (its not getting any better and its very painful) .  Doctor: HiT hanks for your query with Chat Doctor, it would have been better if you had mentioned the antibiotics you are on. Its fine may be your wisdom tooth is impacted, and it has got periodontal flap I believe. Nothing to worry you also take painkillers along with the antibiotics then the pain will come down and seek dentists attention immediately otherwise infection might spread to other areas also like sub mandibular spaces. I think you are talking about dangerous cyst which is commonly associated with impacted wisdom tooth even that can be taken care by your dentist. Kindly visit your dentist for further decision and treatment. Hope this helps you.
Patient: I have a bone-like lump below only my right knee cap. It is extremely painful from a simple touch. I ve had it for what I believe is over a year.

Patient: I am taking Tetralysal for my acne and also taking Cerazette the mini pill, i need the pill to work as a contraceptive but does the antibiotics affect this? Also i have got small patches of skin rashing on my face and i started both around the same time, is it more likely the antibiotics caused this?  Doctor: Hi, Betrayal is a tetracycline antibiotic commonly prescribed to treat acne (pimples). Its common side effects include vomiting, stomach upset, diarrhea, headache and photosensitivity (phototoxic) of the skin. It does not reduce the efficacy of mini pill which is actually a progesterone-only pill. However, if you experience vomiting or diarrhea while taking betrayal this can potentially make your pill less effective at preventing pregnancy. Yes, the facial rash appears to be due to phototoxic effects of this antibiotic. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care

Patient: Hi Doctor,I m suffering from Jaundice & it has been one complete month.I had opt almost three different treatment  aleopathic & ayurvedic too but still not feel good. I m controling my diet also..no fat.no spices & oil food. currently taking Liv.52 teblet & amuyl DS syrup & other home medicine.

Patient: hi doctor i m vicki !!! i need to how i can stop hp permanently . i tried alot to avoid it, i keeps myself busy in doing work but at nights some thoughts starts roming in my mind and atlast do it . i m fed up of this habit before anyone becames to know about it plz help me and tell me the best way to stop it for ever :(  Doctor: Hello Vicki, First I want to tell you that masturbation is not abnormal and is a normal part of sexuality. If, however, you are finding that it has become excessive or interfering with normal activities, such as feeling the need to do this several times a day, then it may be a compulsive behavior.  In that case, some medications that are used to treat obsessive compulsive behavior may be helpful.  Often, SSRI medications are used to for this.  These are most effective for obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviors when used at higher doses (but started at a lower dose and gradually increased).  Consider seeing your family doctor or a psychiatrist to discuss whether treatment might be appropriate. I hope this information helps.

Patient: I had a dental procedure approx. 6 weeks ago. It was a wisdom tooth removal done right in the dental office, no sutures were required and I had no complications. I am now starting to get a little bit of a tooth ache feeling in that spot from time to time, its not constant and its not too painful, but its noticeable, and a slight burning sensation. A nurse told me that it could be spasming and healing. Do I still need to be concerned with lockjaw?  Doctor: Hi. Welcome to Chat Doctor . I have gone through your query and can understand your concern. As per your complaint 6 weeks is a sufficient time and pain after this is not a common finding. There can be a few reasons for pain in extraction region now like:1. Due to improper cleaning in that area food lodgment can take place leading to infection and pain.2. There can be left over root piece accidentally during extraction or any foreign body in the socket leading to inflammation and pain. You need not worry as it is treatable, and you should consult a dentist and get a check-up done and an X-Ray if required. In case of infection antibiotics and painkillers along with warm saline gargles will relieve. In case of root piece or foreign body inclusion removal of the same followed by antibiotics and painkillers will relieve. Hope this information helps. Thanks and regards. Chat Doctor. .

Patient: Hello, I work in a state correctional institution and while conducting a cell search i pricked my thumb with a sewing needle the inmate had in his bed sheet.  The inmate new I was going to enter his room prior to me entering due to his suspicious behavior earlier in the day. So suppose he pricked himself with the needle and left it in his bed sheet for me to get stuck wih it, what are my chances of contracting anything?  Doctor: It depends on if your inmate is suffering from a disease that is blood-borne. For e.g. AIDS, Hepatitis B and C.
Patient: I had unprotected vaginal intercourse with a female who turned out to be a heavy intervenious drug user.  We only had intercourse for 2-3 minutes, and I did not ejaculate.  We were engaged in intercourse before she was completely undressed, and when her shirt was off, I saw that she had track marks on her arms from injecting drugs.  That is when I stopped and left.  That was 8 months ago.   About 2 months ago, I got very ill, with sevear headache, nausea, and a presistant strange taste and smell would not go away, and my auxillary lymph nodes (armpit) swelled, but mostly on the left side.  I could feel something was going on in my auxillary lymph nodes, and it gave me a very squirmy feeling, for lack of a better term. I could not sit still.   I was very ill for about 5-6 days, and then, for the most part, it subsided, but not completely.    To this day, most every day, I still have that taste and smell in my mouth, and when it happens, it is accompanied by a very fatigued feeling.  I have also been having consistant muscle and joint pain, and a lingering, but not very sevear headache, that comes and goes, probably due to the sinus pressure I can feel in my cheeks, eye and forehead area.  I find I am tired far more often that usuall as well.  I also have occational pain from my inner thigh and groin area, on both sides, but again, mostly on the left.  I suspect that that is my groin lymph nodes are causing that pain.   And more recently, in the last 2 weeks, I have had consistant dry mouth. I am an active, yet currently unemployed and uninsured 33 year old college student, and have never had presistant symptoms like this in my life.  I have done much research in the last 2 months and suspect that I may have contracted HIV.  Can you tell me your opinion of the level of risk of the situation where I think i contracted the desiese?  Also, is it normal to have no HIV symptoms whatsoever for six months post possible exposure, and then one day, become consistantly ill with multipule symptoms?   I would also like to know what happens for possible treatment options for someone who is uninsured.   Thank You for your Assistance.  Doctor: Hello Major signs of HIV :1 Weight loss =======1 month.2 Chronic diarrhea=====1 month3 Prolonged fever=====1 monthMinor signs are :1 Persistent cough for one month2 Generalized pruritic dermatitis 3 Recurrent Herpes zoster4 Pharyngeal candidiasis 5 Chronic progressive & disseminated Herpes Simplex 6 GENERALIZED Lymphadenopathies ( as you are having). Antigen antibody HIV RNA test is most accurate. Western blot is most accurate. In my opinion you should get these tests. All the symptoms mentioned are an indication of HIV. About the treatment it depends on after diagnosis establishment. As far as about INSURANCE, I don't know much. Hope this will help you.
Patient: I had back surgery in 6/08 for a flat back,since then I can t walk alone. I Had 2 spinal tears had to stay in NEURO ICU FOR 7 days, left ankle in on a ball no stability 360 degrees. Cyatic damage in left hip. Was told you wanted a curve in waist so that is what I gave u. He would not fix disc unless I let him break my back, still bent over.  Doctor: Here I understand you have damage in spine with spinal curve loss as well you was operated in 2008 but since then the issues are more and now there is no stability with left ankle as well you also have issue with left sciatic nerve. Here I suggest you visit spinal surgeon for secondary opinion and then also take suggestion from a good physiotherapist. Here based on current physical evaluation and report they will suggest you conservative management with physio treatment to heal the soft tissue and strengthen the back muscles. Also, may need to do some treatment for ankle instability and sciatic nerve pain. You can also use hot and cold pack on your back for some more relief and reduce inflammation. For major issue like soft (annular) tissue tear(major) you need to go for surgical repair or immobilization of spine for giving it time to heal. However the treatment will be suggested by spinal surgeon only. Here I suggest you can also take opinion from two different spinal surgeons to have proper idea on safer treatment planning. Here I have given you general guideline since I am not able to assess as well see all your past report. But I suggest following it step by step, and I am sure his will be useful for you. Take care

Patient: my daughter is diagnosed with asl deficiency.  She is mentally retarded as a result of the ammonia that caused damage when she was an infant.  I looked for answers for 14 yrs and just found out what happened.  Is there hope through stem cell transplants?  Doctor: Argininosuccinate Lyase Deficiency is an inborn error of metabolism that affects the urea cycle and induces hyperammonemia in infants and it's catastrophic to development of the nervous system, and most patients even those who are early diagnosed suffer from moderate to severe mental retardation. The good news is Donor cell engraftment with expression of enzyme activity is the goal of liver cell transplantation for inborn errors of liver metabolism with a view to achieving sustained metabolic control. There are few studies made on this subject and one of these patient who receive this treatment was a 3 years old who was shifted from having a sever illness to moderate or late onset disease which is milder, and was able to go to school later on, so there is always hope. I recommend referring to one of these centers to assess her case and make a decision about her, I hope this helps

I want to conceive but it seems imposible due to this problem of which Ive been having for over a year now.

Patient: I had something on the left side of my head between my eye and my ear pulse rapidly several times due, possibly to a flickering screen I was sitting near for several hours. I became very dizzy while this occurred. I became very warm immediately after and cold after that. For about a week afterwards I had a fuzzy not all there feeling. Paramedics could not determine my issue and I went to the ER who could not detect anything wrong with me (blood or EKG). I went to the doctor for a follow up and complained of the fuzzy feeling and another dizzy spell which occurred in the exact same place as the original symptoms appeared (the screen was replaced). The doctor said to wait to see if it came back and to see him again in a month. My back, especially my upper back, neck, head, and shoulders are exceptionally tight even after getting a masssage. My heart feels odd at times. Got any ideas?  Doctor: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. No need to worry about heart diseases because you are ECG is normal. Possibility of migraine is more in your case. Your symptoms start with problem in head part. It is pulsating. So migraine is more likely in your case. So consult neurologist and get done clinical examination for migraine. You will need propranolol and flunarizine combination. Avoid stress and tension. Avoid fasting and take your meals timely.

Patient: I just had an epididymal cyst removed a little over a month.My doctor has given me the ok in resuming sexual activity.when I ejaculate there is pain( more like discomfort in the area below my testicles is this the scotum/uretha area?) I never felt pain BEFORE having cyst removed.Was surgery the cause of this?  Doctor: HelloThanks for query.

Patient: have pain in number 18 tooth. pain  comes and goes in intensity. also have ear pain,a sore jaw and swollen gums on that side. had a fiiing done on that tooth about 6 months ago. i had an x-ray done and dentist said pulp is healthy. i also just had 3 front teeth extracted due to failed root canal treatments. i have been on numerous antibiotics but symptoms seems to keep comming back? i also have post nasal drip, pressure headaches and a stiff neck all on the right side. when to the doctor a month ago and she said my ear was red and had more fluid in it than my other ear. she said i had an ear infection and maybe a sinus infection. Is my problem tooth related or an ear infection or a sinus infection? really confused at this point.  Doctor: Hello, Thanks for writing to us. Since the infected tooth is the upper back molar, chances of spreading infection into ears is very high. The infected tooth has to be either extracted or root canal treated depending on severity of infection. Meanwhile, antibiotics-analgesics has to be administered to prevent underlying infection. Maintain oral hygiene well. Take care.
Patient: Dear Doctor I am a 47 year old female (1.48m and 40 kg) from Singapore in Asia. I have been diagnosed with steatocystoma multiplex only last November 2010. I notice past half year, these cysts have been growing and spreading fast. I have them on my abdomen where the belly button sits and they are hurting. A string under the left arm, a few on right arm, huge ones under the arm, tiny ones growing beneath the breasts, 2 on the left groin and one on front of my throat. . I am getting anxious as I know they are incurable. SOme of these itch and look like mozzie bites which turn red but go off once the itch settles. In my country, few plastic surgeons or dermatologists wish to deal with this condition. I would be most grateful if any doctor can advise if there are any experts or specialists in Asia , US or Europe who work with patients to treat this condition ie vide surgery or other techniques I can consult and engage to remove these cysts? I appreciate the contact details of these specialists. Thank you Athena Weng Singapore  Doctor: HI, Dear,Welcome with your query to Chat Doctor. Based on the facts of your query, You need to treat the complications of the Steatocystoma and not the recurring sebocystomatosis, as it's an autosomal dominant disease, tranferred and inherited from your parents.

Will appreciate writing your feedback review comments, to help the needy patients like you at Chat Doctor. Good Day!!  Chat Doctor. S. Genl-CVTS

Patient: My husband seems to get this blotchy rash on his face, back, chest and its starting to go on his arms when he drinks. It always starts in his ears and face and he complains about being hot when the rash starts. He only drinks beer and he could have 2 beers or 6 beers, it happens either way.

Patient: Hi...Im a 59yr old female on norvasc for almost 20 years 5mg to treat a moderate hbp number that use to swing up and down.  Ive been more stable on the drug but the bone popping and grinding is not consistent with my age and health.  Im in pretty good shape and excercise on and off and a little overweight at 158lbs..54.  I also get a chest fullness sensation and that is only relieve when I allow myself to MISS the drug a night or two.  I really want to come off this drug now.  What do you suggest?  Doctor: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. In my opinion, you should not stop the Chat Doctor.  Since you are above 50 years of age and having hypertension, better to first rule out heart diseases for your chest fullness and tightness. So get done blood pressure monitoring, ECG and 2d echo. If all these are normal then no need to worry about cardiac diseases. Sometimes, stress and tension can also cause similar sensations. So avoid stress and tension, be relaxed and calm. Don't stop your blood pressure medicine by your own. This can be serious. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.
Patient: I was diagnosed as having an irritate meniscus in my right knee. in June of 2013,I was up some steps and banged my foot into the step on the way up. I couldn t walk, had multiple times where my leg almost gave way under me. I m finally gaining some stability almost a year later. My question is how long does an irritated meniscus normally take to recover?  Doctor: Hi, thank you for providing the brief history of you. A detailed musculoskeletal assessment is advised. As the injury cured in 2013 and now all fine, I will advise you to undergo physical therapy as it will help you regain the strength in the muscles which supports the knee for locking and unlocking mechanism. Usually after a week of injury, physical therapy is started, but in your cased it is made delayed, so taking a proper care and undergoing physical therapy will be good to save the knee joint from early degeneration.

I read your question and I understand your concern. If it is 40 nanogram per ml then it is quite normal, no need to worry about it. Rest is the back pain so in my patients of your age I usually prescribe skeletal muscle relaxant like Tab. Numeral forte 1 three times day along with calcium supplements like Tab Alan D, 1 tablet daily with bed rest and avoidance of heavy work.

Patient: Iv been getting a lot of back and hip pain after I had MRI scans to show a slip disk I was also allowed a nurve root block on l5 this has help also the MRI scan piled up 2 cyst and said to send me to see a gynaecologist. My gp also done a internal and seen 2 white cyst. So when I went to the hospital 5 days later to have a internal scan there was nothing there. So I m confused. Iv also started bleeding 1 week after my period finished. Seen my gp who said maybe the cyst has just gone!. What with in 5 days. Please advise  Doctor: Slip disc should be treated by lumbar or sacral support or traction of vertebral column. Later when pain subsides, some physio or yoga can be done that will sustain the relief. After nerve block there may not be much pain because of same nerve. However, it may come at other place. If there were uterine cysts, may be these were only accumulation of blood in some kind of bulging which gave way to bleeding. Hard cysts do not go so soon. Being Ayurveda doctor, I suggest to my patients to take extract / decoction of leaves of Coral Jasmine plant (Night glowering Jasmine - Harbinger). Its common I'm India and South Asia. I do not know if it's at your place. However, you may try to get online. If needed we may help you too. Intervertebral disc problems, Sciatica, endometrial bleeding etc. may be controlled effectively by it. Alternatively painkillers and hormonal styptics are available in allopatry. Hope it helps
Patient: Hi, im a 27 yr old female and over the past 2 yrs i have been getting left sided chest pain, and pain in my left rib that also radiates to the back. my 3rd rib is protruding as thats what my doctor said. i feel breathless n i get skipped hb everyime i get pain in that rib. I have had x rays done but everything seems normal.  Doctor: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Mild Breathlessness, skipped heart beat, left sided chest pain etc. can be seen in arrhythmia (rhythm disturbances in heart). So first get done ECG, 2d echo and Holder monitoring (24 hours continuous recording of ECG). If all these are normal then no need to worry about heart diseases. In my opinion, your pain is mostly due to musculoskeletal cause. So avoid heavyweight lifting and strenuous exercise. Avoid movements causing pain. Avoid bad postures in sleep. Apply warm water pad on affected areas. Take painkiller like ibuprofen. Sit with proper back and chest support. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.

There can be various reasons for this - for example, personality problems, influence of substances, etc. Since his problems seem to be quite prominent and resulting in serious consequences, it is essential that he gets professional help. The right specialist to deal with such problems would be a Psychiatrist. So, I would suggest that you arrange for a psychiatric consultation as early as possible. There are ways to help him out - by means of psychological therapy and sometimes, even medication may be helpful.

Patient: Hi I am taking glicomet gp1 twice a day .once in morning after food and once in the evening after food . Today I took one pill after dinner and onece more by mistake after 3 hours later mistaking it for a digestive pill I take before bed . Is it fatal ? Can I pass out in my sleep ? Should I eat a chocolate before bed?  Doctor: Hello have gone through your question and understood your concern. Glycomet GP1 is an antidiabetic agent that contains metformin HY Chat Doctor.  These tablets work by increasing the amount of insulin released by your pancreas and decreasing the amount of glucose in the blood;Glycogen GP1 can cause hypoglycemia and this RISC is more possible in your case with the ingestion of double dosage. It is not fatal, Dont worry! You will not pass out in your sleep. But you should know that it can be very, very dangerous because it can cause nocturnal hypoglycemia or low sugar that occur at night while asleep. To avoid the occurrence of hypoglycemia I suggest eating a snack before bed. A chocolate is ok! If you were my patient, I will ask to check your blood sugar before bed. Your blood glucose levels should not be lower than 120 milligrams per deciliter before bed. If this night this happens, you might need to eat a larger bedtime snack. This will avoid the low blood sugar during the night. So, you have no reason to stress! My last advice: Be careful with the doses of your

Patient: my son had a stroke when he was before he was born, he has spastic hemiplegia, cerebral palsy on his right side of his body, he also has chiari 1 malformation in his brain, if he was struck in his head could or would it cause seizures, he has been hit in his head at school and I m worried it might cause seizures to start, I was told by his dr that it could and that strokes and seizures go hand and hand, just no age of when  Doctor: Hello! Welcome and thank you for asking on Chat Doctor! I understand your concern and would explain that your sons brain has been damaged since birth (probably perinatal hypoxia). This damages to his brain, are not only the cause of motor deficits and a delayed psycho-motor development, but also can cause seizures, as a result of the dysfunction of those brain regions. You should know that seizures in this case are more probable to occur during the first years of life, but can also occur later. A head trauma can induce them, as it can cause a new imbalance in the brain cell function and inflammation. If he starts having seizures, the treatment with antiepileptic Chat Doctor.

Patient: I just pulled something out of my daughter s butt. She is 2 1/2 years old and has been complaining of her butt hurting for a month. They put her on Miralax, but she still complains. What i pulled out of her butt looked like a long piece of pulled beef. It was stringy but lumped together. I ve seen this several times now, but this was the longest piece. Any idea on what it could be?  Doctor: Hi, the long stringy thing that you removed could be a tapeworm or any other parasite. This is also the cause of constipation which required MiraLax and is also the cause of pain in the abdomen. Give your child Tablet Albendazole 400 mg single tablet. Repeat the dose after 1 week. She should be alright in a few days. Give her some supplements in form of Complex as infestation leads to malabsorption. Spy A to Z 5 ml twice a day will be helpful. Thanks and regards.
Patient: hi. i have a toddler he is almost 3, he just got his endoscopy done because he had unexplained belly pains, often hiccups (since he was born on and off hiccups) and since 2 months or so now almost every day those strange rashes mostly groin area and down the legs. last friday his lower lip swoll up and both his feet too, big swelling on right wrist and body rashes, not itchy, more blotchy and with the endoscopy we found out his one stomach muscle is weak and sore around and his esophagus is inflamed. doc took biopsy from the esophagus tissue. now we have to wait... he also did blood tests like C1 Inhibitor , C3 und C4, CBC, sedm.rate, etc. My son is very allergic that we know since almost a year. last year he had 2 months unexplained diarrhea , then we did allergy testing, he is allergic to rice, egg whites, molds, trees etc a lot of stuff which we avoid as much as we can. but he never had those strange rashes. our GI doc thinks he could have HANE Hereditary Angioneurotic Edema. What is your oppinion? the eosophils in blood tests always evlevated, low lymphocytes etc. and he sometimes complaines that eating cereals (like cheerios chocolate / there is no rice in it) hurts him in his throat or esophagus. and than he just dont eat it. and since he was born he has a noice when he breathes, not every day, but a lot. please answer. thanks so much. god bless u! Mandy  Doctor: Hi, Thanks for query, Your toddler is having many problems and require evaluation, and you have already undergone investigations. Let gastroenterologist take decision. But I have to add something which may be helpful. As he has high eosinophils and recurrent gastric complains, go for Stool test for ova and cyst of worms, thread worms or round worms which is known to give all symptoms like, allergy,high eosinophil count, loose motions. Ok and bye.

Patient: Hello my boyfriend has congestive heart failure and he is peeing very little he also has stomach aches and has a history of drinking alcohol sometimes his sex drive is not there we barely have sex cause of his breathing and he has a history of asthma do you know what can be going on  Doctor: Hi, A history of congestive heart failure with a recent onset of a decrease in urine volume needs to be evaluated as this can be what we call "Cardio renal syn Chat Doctor.  His stomach aches can be related to many factors which may include the liver (as in congestive nephropathy in heart failure) or a problem in the kidneys causing too many levels of toxins not being excreted in the urine (uremia).  I would suggest a consult at the Emergency Room to check for his present status, appropriate diagnosis of the present condition, and to check for any co-existing problems, like infections which can further aggravate heart failure, if not treated promptly. This may require hospitalization for observation and definitive treatment. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.
Patient: i am planning for an iui this cycle and have started follicular study on my 10th day on that day i had one follicle on each size 10mm, and my endometrium was 8.4mm. a hemorrhagic cyst of 16x14 was also seen on my right side, i asked my doc abt it she said it is fine and will reduce on its own. i then went on the 12th day but my follicular size has not increased at all its the same 10mm on both side but endometrium is 9.3mm. i am worried if my follicles will grow further. what shud i do? presently my doc has prescribed me oosure twice a day and folic acid .  Doctor: Hello. Thanks for writing to us. You will have to wait till the follicles grow to 18-20 mm size which is considered to be a mature size. After that only GUI can be tried. Without any follicular growth, there is no ovulation and GUI is futile. You need to wait and repeat scan on day 12 and 14. I hope this information has been both informative and helpful for you.
Patient: I just experienced sharp chest pain in the upper/middle part of my chest while blowing my nose. It was so severe and unexpected I stopped blowing my nose. Blowing my nose is part of my nightly routine, so the blowing the nose part is not new or associated with a cold-the chest pain is new.  Doctor: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. By your history and description, possibility of musculoskeletal pain is more in your case. But better to rule out causes pleurisy (inflammation of pleura) first. Common causes for pleurisy are pneumonia, pleural effusion, Pulmonary contusions etc. So get done chest x-ray. If chest x-ray is normal than no need to worry about these causes. Forceful nose blowing causes contraction of intercostal muscles. And this can be painful sometimes. So musculoskeletal pain is more likely. Apply warm water pad on affected areas. Start painkiller and muscle relaxant Chat Doctor.  Avoid movements causing pain. Avoid strenuous exercise and heavyweight lifting. Don't worry, you will be alright. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health. Thanks.
Patient: Hi. I m sure it s been asked before but I ve been dizzy for about the past week. Went to ENT and he said it s most likely labyrinthitis. I used a netti pot about 3 weeks ago with warm, non sterile water from faucet. I feel constantly buzzed . Not so much dizzy but just out of it My question is could my symptom be from a parasite via the Nettie pot? If it s not labyrinthitis what else could it be? Thank you Steve  Doctor: Hi, Thanks for your question on ChatDoctorI do understand your pain and discomforts per your history is concerned your problem is due to virus only but not parasite as mentioned by you which causes inflammation of your inner ear. Your second question was if it is not labyrinthine then what it may be, my answer is dizziness can be due to various pathological causes among them for your case BPV, Vestibular neuritis, and anemia can not be ruled out. So Take cinnarazine tablets for dizziness and check your hemoglobin level if low take iron caps, Add a multivitamin capsules every day at bedtime. Hope that helps

Patient: My name is augustina I ve had a surgery for lump in my left breast which the doctor says is Fibroid Dyplesia 25years ago over the years a lump has grown on my back on the same left side the lump is not painful but in my body under the lump is paining a lot sometimes I cannot move my arm Can it be breast cancer or can the lump be operated on  Doctor: HI, Welcome to Chat Doctor with your query. Confirm the diagnosis before the Treatment Planning-By the facts of your query, In my opinion, you seem to have infective lump? Boil/Sebaceous Cyst with reactivated infection in it, as it's paining under the lump. In such a situation, its very difficult to confirm its relation to the Fibrous Dysplasia removed 25 years back. But the chances are there of link to the Fibrous Dysplasia, as this lump in the back on left side could be a Secondary metastasis from an occult/hidden breast cancer in the left breast. Treatment-Antibiotics/anti-inflammatory treatment from your doctor, if responded would confirm the infective cause of it.Non-response would need Second opinion from Surgeon who would direct further treatment after proper examination and investigations, accordingly. But don't worry till this lump in the back is confirmed by biopsy as Cancerous and Could be treated by -Surgical Excision with Biopsy, which would confirm further treatment line. Hope this would help you to plan treatment with your doctor. Will appreciate hitting thanks and writing review comments to benefit needy patient visitors at Chat Doctor like you. Good day. Chat Doctor. N. Senior Surgical Specialist. M.S. Genl-CVTS.
Patient: I have had strange chest pains off and on over the course of 15 years or so, theyve come and gone less and less as I got older, (Im now 28.)  but every now and then in the same spot that I would get the pains I get this slight kicking feeling on the inside of my chest, like when Im pregnant and the baby is kicking me.  Dont know if this makes any sense but Im really curious as to whats going on.  By the way, the original chest pains were never diagnosed as anything so I dont know what they were to begin with.  Can you help?

Patient: I am a 55 yr female, in good health. In the last several weeks, getting a sharp punching pain in the center of my chest. Happens during the day while working, or in the evening while resting, watching TV. Sometimes it will hit 4-6 times a day, but then 2-3 days nothing. Have been extra tired lately, feeling like I am drained, and want to sleep my life away. Having headaches more than usually. There are times when heart feels like it is racing. I work in a deli, where it can become stressful at times. Notsure what is going on, but ddon t want panic. Heart disease runs on both sides of my family. There are times when I feel a heavy feeling in my left chest are and sharp pain between my shoulders, but it doesn t last very long, and only happens once in a blue moon.  Doctor: Hello, i have gone through your history. Your complaint is suggestive of stable angina sectors. The chest pain which results due to decreased blood supply to heart is known as angina sectors. And when angina occurs on exertion we call it stable angina. You have already strong family history. So you must be careful. You must go for resting ECG and echocardiogram along with lipid profile and blood sugar estimation. Depending on reports you may need coronary angiography to decide whether medicines will be enough to protect you against heart attack or you will angioplasty or bypass. Meanwhile you must start Tab. Metoprolol 25 mg once a day, with aspirin 75 mg and atorvastatin 10 mg at bedtime. Further addition and alteration should be done after complete evaluation. Please proceed for early evaluation. My best wishes. Chat Doctor.

Patient: Hello doctor, I am suffering from facial nerve pain. Am taking tablets tegretal 200 3 times aday , gabatin 400 3 times a day and duzela 20 2 times a day from last 4 years but still I have stiffness andvpain on my face. Pls give me your advice Regards, Mrs. Arpita.  Doctor: Hello, I have gone through your question and understand your concern. Facial pain is a debilitating type of pain, but it does not come from your facial nerve but from the trigeminal nerve. Anyway, you are already on full Chat Doctor.  You might increase the regret dose, but this might have some adverse. The next step in my opinion is injecting glycerol in the trigeminal ganglion, which is a minimally invasive treatment with good outcomes, but there is high probability of recurrence this does not help I recommend a cerebral MRI to see if there is a neurovascular conflict of the trigeminal nerve after it leaves the brain stem. In case there is this situation you can do a microvascular decompression, which is very invasive but with a high percentage of pain relief. Hope this answers some of your questions, please feel free for further questions

Doctor: Hi thanks for asking question. Here is some treatment modality for your son. With soap and water area has to clean properly. Application of ice pack and cold compress relieve pain and swelling. Baking soda paste can be applied over it. After bite topical ammonia helpful.

If with even steroid and antihistamines swelling not decreases and not improving then refer to doctor for starting antibiotic. I hope I have solved your query, thanks

What could cause the distended endometrium?  Doctor: Hi welcome to ChatDoctorDistended endometrium in your case could be related to recurrence of fibroid, most likely submucosal fibroid. Get pap smear, fractional curettage to confirm rule out malignancy immediately.Meanwhile, take tab.meftalspas. Hysterectomy with bilateral salting oophorectomy is helpful in your case. Consult your gynecologist for expert management. Thankyou

You will mostly have hypothyroidism and treatment is daily thyroxine tablet according to thyroid function test report. So consult doctor and discuss all these.
Patient: Sir, Iam using encorate chrona for my daughter since 5months as prescribed by nuerologist she is putting on weight is ti the side effect of the medicine this has been prescribed for 2 years for absent seizures she is 8 yrs old now?------ YYYY@YYYY  Doctor: Hi, Thank you for posting your query. I have noted your daughters symptoms. She has absence seizures, which seem to be well controlled with sodium valproate. However, she is also putting on weight. Most probably, weight gain in your daughter is related to the use of sodium valproate. We should not stop valproate, as her seizures may worsen. Instead, we can control her diet and make her play outdoor games. These measures would keep her weight in check. I hope my answer helps. Please get back if you have any follow-up queries or if you require any additional information. Wishing you good health, Chat Doctor. Ly/
Patient: My husband and I are both suffering from what seems to be a stomach virus. He has had symptoms for about 3 weeks, and me about 1.5. Bloated stomach (especially after eating) some diarreah,, mild regurgitation. No fever. My husband s symptoms have been more acute than mine. we are both taking Mylanta and it seems to help only temporarily. My husband had arthroscopic knee surgery on 3/8 and had severe headache and nausea symptoms. The nausea has abated (except for the stomach symptoms above) but is still having headache issues , although not as badly as the 2 to 4 days after surgery. The doctor felt he was having a reaction to the anesthesia and possibly to the multiple medicines they gave him after surgery to counter the nausea.  Doctor: Hello, Treatment of stomach infection depends upon the cause. So he needs to perform a stool analysis. In viral infection; you need to rest your stomach, avoid foods that aggravate the symptoms such as large meals, spicy food, and fatty meals. Then your doctor will prescribe Chat Doctor.

Patient: I understand a lot of people deal with this dizziness if they get up to fast but I think mines worst. Like when I get up, I have a blurry vision and sometimes even total blackout, my body feels week. The back of my head feels warm and tingly, it was weird but I could still stand up and even walk. It clears out in a few seconds and I couldnt actually recall what I did during that temporary blackout. I googled it and the signs are very much alike to this disorder, called presyncope? Am I correct? Is it dangerous? Is it a brain trauma? Does it have anything to do with anxiety disorder?  Doctor: Hi, Thank you for posting your query. Your symptoms are indeed suggestive of presyncope. As such, it is not dangerous, however, we need to find out the underlying cause. This could be related to low BP or fall in BP when standing (postural hypotension). Please also check your blood hemoglobin level, as low hemoglobin can cause similar symptoms. Anxiety can contribute to the symptoms. Please get back if you require any additional information. Best wishes, Chat Doctor. Ly/
Patient: Dear Dr, From last few months I am having a problem of high blood pressure. My age is 24. Height 5.7 weight 62Kgs. My bloodpressure reading are 160/100 and above. Though I am not taking any stress and eating a healthy diet. I do take alcoholic drinks like one beer in a week and occasional smoker not an addict. Do take one cigarette in a week. No taking enough sleep just take sleep of 6hrs that too not a proper one. Please advise what can be the reason of this and also advise if I need to go for any tests to diagnose the problem. My mother is a patient of high blood pressure. Thanks in Advance Mukesh  Doctor: Hello Mukesh, 24 is too young to have higher pressure.  Though as you say your diet is ok, you are not overweight and one stick or bear a week should not cause this significantly pressure. Two things important here are. You need at least 7-8 hours of good sleep, less sleep increase stress hormones on the body which in turn may increase your pressure. As you have a family history of hypertension, you should be extra careful. Cut salt in diet to 2-3 GMS a day Aerobic exercise at least 45 mins 5 days a week. Maintain a stress-free and healthy lifestyle.  As you are too young, all secondary cause of increased pressure should be ruled out. So baseline blood work up, kidney function test, renal artery Doppler and kidney sonography and other relevant test based on more detailed history and examination by a doctor. Hoping I could help. Regards
Patient: Got results back of brain mri . Says there is a 3mm nodular focus of T2 and FLAIR hyperintensity within the subcortical white matter of the right frontal lobe also There is a modular focus of high T1 signal which lies along the anterior aspect of the clivus to the right of midline, cofluent with the posterior aspect of the right sphenoid sinus What does this mean?  Doctor: Hi, Thank you for posting your query. The first finding- hyperintensity in the subcortical white matter-could represent an ischemia (decreased blood flow to brain). Also, it is a common finding in migraine patients. The second finding represents a sinus infection. Both are minor findings and are not of any concern. However, I would advise you to discuss these findings with your doctor. Best wishes, Chat Doctor.

Today I experience considerable internal pain around the scar area accompanied by what appears to be the movement of my internal organs. It is extremely uncomfortable.

Please go for a repeat ultrasound abdomen to rule out for any local reinfection. Thank you. Take care
Patient: My 5yo sons normal temp is around 96. He spent a week in the hospital with a temp of 100-102 sleeping constantly. He had retropharyngeal abscess to which the doctors surgically removed.

This can be due to bacteria-gram negative in particular and many times are resistant to many antibiotics making treatment difficult. 2. Possibility of tuberculosis. Well, the Chat Doctor. I hope the baby is fine now.

Patient: Hello,I was recently seen at the ER for a lump near the groin. Now they looked and examined it but they didnt do anything else like bloodwork, ultrasound,  etc. Now I am worried since they didnt do anything. They did give me antibiotics to clear an infection that they said I had. Help!  Doctor: Hi. If the Doctor has said infection, I would think more in the lines of an enlarged lymph node. Continue the medicines for 5 days minimum. Se the results. IF still persists may need further investigations

So physiotherapy will definitely work and must be done without fail. This is the only treatment at this stage. But in case of any warning sign like bladder involvement sudden breathing difficulty, loss of power, worsening of symptoms may require operative decompression with or without fixation.  Along with physiotherapy you need to avoid pillow, serious activity, putting NY weight on head; take warm compression ; and other symptomatic management like analgesic (NSAID),muscle relaxant, PPI n vitamins.

Patient: Hello, I had a spinal stenosis surgery on 2-26-2014 and now both of my arms are very painful that i could not sleep and was wondering if I can take Roxicet before bedtime for my pain or Diazepam 5 mg.? I have mixed messages what not to take. Please help. I also have very stiff neck, shoulder and back pain and due to this stiffness, my TMJ came back and this also aggravated along with my arms pains. thank you. Ms. Leah Wong  Doctor: Hello! Welcome on Chat Doctor ! You should know that your symptoms could be indicative of articular pain in both arms. Chronic spinal column degeneration could lead to such symptomatology. For this reason, I would recommend performing a new cervical spine MRI study and a nerve conduction study. Regarding Roxie, I would not recommend taking it for a long time, because it can lead to addiction and tolerance. Instead, I would recommend taking amitriptyline or pregabalin for the chronic management of nerve pain. A new surgery may be needed, depending on the new MRI results. Hope you will find this answer helpful! Best wishes,

Patient: Ok  good morning Dr.  my question is what is the cause of a high or low pressure to harm the human body as it is doing to my husband hes 72 Years of edge he has been in a accident, and since Dec., 2013. He is being experiencing some kind of weakness lost of strength in his muscles, temperature is going up or down, and he is very very weak !

The truth is that if we do not use our muscles, they become weak and the strength and muscle mass Chat Doctor.

I wish your husband well. Thank you so much for using our services and feel free to ask for more information and clarifications if need be.
Patient: Good evening Dr, I have just found out that I have pernicious ananiema. i have had b12 injections but my count has not passes 230, i have had blood checked and within 2months it has dropped to 127. i don t feel any difference from having these injections. I have pins and needles in my toes so badly that it worries me. i feel exhausted when i wake up in the morning and my mood could be described as depressive to say the least. what should i be doing or who should i speak to other than my gp as nobody seems to take my condition serious. thank you  Doctor: Hello, thanks for using Chat Doctor. Pernicious anemia is a type of anemia that results from a deficiency in nutritional supply of vitamin B12 or from an autoimmune disease that leads to destruction of a factor in the stomach that aids in absorption of it B12. Autoimmune causes could be hereditary and in this case could occur in other members of the family. Diphyllobothrium datum a fish tape worm is also known to cause It B12 deficiency. It B12 deficiency usually presents with large red blood cells. However, It B12 deficiency is not the only cause of large red blood cells. Deficiency in folic acid also is a cause and if your diagnosis of pernicious anemia was made based upon your full blood count or blood smear results, then it is likely you have a folic acid deficiency. Folic acid is richly found in leafy vegetables, liver, kidney, egg yolk etc. and is also found as a supplement.  You need to see a hematologist for a better evaluation and for further tests like bone marrow smear and autoantibodies if necessary. If you have more questions, please do not hesitate. Thanks.

Patient: Yes, and thank you. I have a soon to be 12 year old son who has complained of a stomach ache only in the evening after we have eaten supper. He sometimes says that it makes him feel sickish, but mainly hurts. He does not complain during the day at all. This has been for about 2 months. He has seen the doctor.....taking previcid lowest dose at night and taking Metimucil one time daily. THinking that he has irritable bowel or could be a ulcer.  Doctor: His understand your concerns but don't worry. The most likely reason for recurrent stomach pain with no other symptoms such as weight loss, bowel disturbances, urinary problems, vomiting etc. and normal on clinical examination are functional pains. So, just go for CBC, CRP, urine and stool examination to rule out any organic cause. If absent then you may just keep him on placebo for a few days to check for response and functional cause. Hopefully it will be of help. Take care
Patient: Hello, my daughter, (an 8 year old twin), seemingly out of nowhere has developed a visible protrusion on her right temple. It s firm, fixed and non-painful. It would seem to be a preauricular cyst, but there is no pitting , and palpates deeply, rather than superficially. Beginning just slightly above/at the tragus and extending directly outward about an inch toward the cheekbone, it lays over the temple. This has only come to our attention in the last few days, and seems quite large to have not been noticed until now. No other symptoms or causations are present. Is this a likely site for a malignancy?? We have an appt. scheduled, but for now...worried sick. Thank you.  Doctor: Hi.this seems like a Desmond cyst as it is occurring at the junctional area of 2 bones of the skull. Nothing need to be worried as it is only a recent phenomenon and the kids daily activities are not getting disturbed because of it. Regards -
Patient: I found a lump under my skulp towards the left of the middle of my head. It s an inch long, hard like a bone but doesn t hurt to touch it unless I m consistently touching it and then it gets sore. On the outside it looks like a normal skulp, nothing pops out, it looks normal. Should I be worried?  Doctor: Hi, I had gone through your question and understand your concerns. Lumps of the scalp are mainly caused by local infection of hair roots, skin glands and a part of them are lipomas (enlargement of sebaceous glands). I think you have not to worry right now, you have to keep your scalp clean, you can use locally alcohol solution and in the coming days if you see that lump growing or becoming painful, then you have to see a local Doctor. Hope this answers your question. If you have additional questions or follow-up questions then please do not hesitate in writing to us. I will be happy to answer your questions.
Patient: I have had arthritis in just about all my joints for many years (I m 57 now) I also have DISH Disease. Today I was told I have calcified tendonitis in my right shoulder. All the Dr. said was therapy. I am on a long list of medication, including the fentanyl patch, and some other p,ain and inflammatory medication. I m on insulin, and I have micro vascular angina to mention a fee of my problems. Is there anything else I can do to ease all my aches and pain?  Doctor: Hi you have arthritis in just about all joints and also have a DISH Disease. You have been prescribed physiotherapy and are taking anti-inflammatory painkillers + fentanyl patch.

Patient: What is the prognosis of someone with a C5 fracture? The fracture was bad, C5 was in pieces and later C4-C7 were fused. I understand that SCI s are all very different, but I am wondering if this person could ever walk again? What about vent-dependency?  Doctor: Hello, Please correct me if I am wrong in understanding your situation. It looks that affected person is on supported ventilation and was operated for comminuted fracture C5 vertebrae. It also looks that he had severe injury and compression or disruption of continuity of spinal cord. Our respiratory centers have supply from C3 TO C6 cord segments. If the present situation is due to edema of cord then situation will perfectly resolve with time but if there is complete disruption of cord then situation goes towards the dependency on mechanical ventilation more. Although medical science is developing day by day, so you should be optimistic for future. In my practice I have seen some patients improving up to a good level. At present, he/she needs supportive treatment with good physiotherapy. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care

Doctor: Hello Manual, Your question is very important one. The psychiatric medicines even if given for a mild illness (however, nowadays there are very few patients who hit and tear clothes.and even a non violent and normal looking and working patient can also be harboring severe psychiatric illness) should.be taken.

So, the duration of 3-6 months starts after complete elimination of symptoms. Many people/ family members are in hurry to stop the medicines, but this should not be done. The second episode usually follows the first (any time in life) which is severer than the first one. The best way to reduce the possibility of this second episode is - to take a complete course in the first attempt only. And these
Patient: My mom was just diagnosed with papilledema. The doctor said her left eye was really swelled and there was a lot of fluid behind her eye. She has been having bad headaches , and has been sick at her stomach. She has an appointment for an MRI scheduled next week. I m really worried! Is this life threatening??? The whole pressure on the brain really concerns me!  Doctor: Papilloma is a very specific diagnosis which refers to optic nerve edema from increased intracranial pressure... this is by definition. So, for the moment, your mom has swollen optic nerves or optic disk edema. Optic disk edema has multiple causes including... 1. Uncontrolled high blood pressure,2. Rare bilateral diabetic papillomata and 3. Strokes to the optic nerve (anterior ischemic optic neuropathy) which can rarely be bilateral, are associated with vision loss and may be associated with giant cell arthritis. Since these are all treatable easily, they must be considered. (Likewise infiltration of the optic nerve through neoplastic processes such as CNS lymphoma can cause the appearance of edema and will show up on an MRI.) Once these possibilities have been considered, the next logical step is MRI... This is looking for CNS tumors and should be performed with contrast.  If negative, lumbar puncture measuring opening pressure should be performed with removal of cerebral spinal fluid for cytology to look for signs of infection or tumor in the brain. (This test will actually diagnose the patient with papilloma.) The swollen nerves in this case are just a sign... the underlying reason is most important.  The most common CNS tumor in middle aged women is meningioma which is benign and can be resected... everything is worse. The MRI will give you the answer.
Patient: my son is 2 and was diagnosed with an eye virus. i cannot remember the name of it. the dr said it was like pinkeye but worse. the infection started as a small red blood shot spot on his eye and 24 hrs later the entire eye was blood red then 24 hrs later the other eye was completely red. no white of the eye can be seen now. we continue to use the eye drops he perscribed . i am just wanting to know the name of the virus for research. thank you  Doctor: Hi, It is difficult to guess. There are 100s of viruses. But the most common ones are - adenovirus.  Other viruses that can be responsible for conjunctival infection include herpes simplex virus (HSV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), coronavirus (retrovirus 70, Cossack A24), pox virus (molluscan contagious, vaccine), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

Patient: My daughter is feeling numbness along the outside of her right foot. This numbness has been occurring for about 2 weeks. It started with a tingling sensation, but is now just numb. I see that the Sural Nerve and the Lateral Planter Nerve may serve these areas, but I am not sure. Is there other at home testing that we can conduct to help to isolate the possible issue?  Doctor: There is no home testing for these lesions. You need to consult an orthopedic surgeon. Electromyography nerve conduction study can confirm the neurological involvement.

Don't worry about stomach ache and fatigue, it will subside with the infection. You need to see pulmonologist for further advise. Thanks.
Patient: So, a few days ago I was masturbating and after I was done I looked down and saw a bump on the left side of my penis,its on the middle of the shaft, not near the head or near the base. It looks like its a bump under the skin because when i would move the skin around, it would move with it. It doesnt hurt to the touch but when i try to apply a little bit of pressure to it, it ll obviously cause a little pinch. It s not big at all, about 2/3 the size of a pea but im still concerned. It s hard but not like a rock, it s kind of hard to describe it. I researched a lot and I thought it was a lymphocele until recently and I think it might be a cyst, and I ve been going back and forth. It doesn t go away and come back as far as I know because it hasn t gone away yet. I haven t masturbated since I got it because I read that you shouldn t if you have a lymphocele because it ll irritate it.  Doctor: HelloThanks for query. The lymphocyte is very rare to occur on shaft of the penis. The painless lump on the shaft of the penis is mostly a Sebaceous Cyst. The penile skin is rich in sebaceous glands and hence prone to get more sebaceous cyst due to accumulation of sebum beneath the skin. Normally they fade away without treatment however they need to be treated if increase in size or get infected. Please consult qualified General Surgeon for clinical evaluation and if feels it to get excised get it excised in Toto. This is a simple surgery done under local anesthesia as an out patient procedure and offers permanent cure. Chat Doctor.

Patient: I am a 38 yo female. 230lb. 58. I have had past history of kidney stones but that has been ruled out through blood tests and ct.  I have pain in my right side and on right side of my back.  It seems as though anything I eat or drink makes me cramp.  I had a ultrasound and blood work and no stones were to be found and blood test results were normal.  Whatever that means!!! Today, I have a Hida Scan and after laying there an hour I was again injected.  I became severely naseous to the point I felt lightheaded.  My stomach fellt as if it was burning in the right side and cramping in the lower right side of my pelves.  Does this mean that my gallbladder is not pumping correctly????  Doctor: The problem during HIDE scan would have been a reaction to the Chat Doctor. Only the report can tell whether you have a functioning gall bladder or not. The cramps you are describing can also be due to IBS or so. Get a proper treatment with a course of an antibiotic and antispasmodic tablets for 7 days, your problem may be solved. You have already undergone the CT scan and an ultrasonography, which you have mentioned to be normal. It would have already picked up the other problems. I would think of IBS and other reasons. I would advise you to go for a test of barium called Enterocolitis under a fluoroscopy control to see the real time movement of the bowel, any obstruction or motility disorder.

Patient: hi my son is 4 years old and he has JIA and Rheumatic fever and about 2 months ago he started having a really bad odor to him we tried deodorant thinking it was him sweating and nothing helped we spoke to 2 different doctors and they think its a metallic smell but don t know what could be causing it  Doctor: Hi, Welcome to the ChatDoctorBrief answer... it could buy hyperthyroidism or metabolic disorder. Detailed answer... Since sweating can occur normal when there is increased temperature outside and body responses by increasing sweating to balance the body temperature. But if there is particular odor, it can be disbalance of metabolism which can cause metallic odor. As thyroid hormones have crucial roles in controlling metabolism, and if there is hyperthyroidism it can cause sweating and anxiety. Other cause can be amino acid metabolic disorder. I would suggest that get thyroid function test, blood electrolytes , urine test to detect amino acid metabolites, and follow accordingly. Chat Doctor.
Patient: I fractured ribs (6-8) 9 days ago and had some increased difficulty breathing and pain six days later.  The dr. ordered a follow up chest x-ray which shows atelectasis of the left lung base.  He has not responded to tell me how to treat this.  As I also have a history of asthma, Im wondering if I should start taking the steroid long acting inhaler as well as the albuterol that he had instructed me to use routinely when I first fractured my ribs.  Doctor: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your situation and problem. Rib fracture causes paradoxical respiration in that particular segment. So that part of the lung becomes poorly ventilated and thus atelectasis occur. In catechesis chances of infection are high, so better not to take steroid. Instead of steroid, you should take anti-inflammatory, mucosa tickets Chat Doctor.  And wear rib belt to avoid mobilization of fractured segments. This will fasten the recovery and healing. Also apply warm water pad on affected site for pain relief. It will take at least 3-4 weeks for healing of fracture rib.

Patient: Hi, Can anyone give me the solution for Aplastic Anemia ? my 4 years old daughter suffering from Aplastic anemia since April 2010. Regards, Vinod  Doctor: Dear Vinod:Thanks for the query. There are different modalities. The treatments depend on severity of the problem. If it is less severe the immune-modulator medications-Antithymocyte globulin (ATG), cyclosporin (CSA), and cyclophosphamide are useful. She requires intermittent blood transfusions. If it is more severe, she needs Bone Marrow transplantation (BMT) from appropriate donor which is the definitive treatment. She needs conditioning before transplantation with ATG/cyclophosphamide so that the graft (BMT) will not be rejected.

Patient: If I stand for even a short period of time my right heel begins to pain. The longer I stand (or walk)the worse it gets, eventually includes the entire sole.Remaining off of my feet is my only relief - ice, soaking and bio-freeze only temporairly help. Usually it is much better in the morning, but if I have to stand or walk much, the pain returns. This pain makes it very difficult to walk to get my exersize in.  Doctor: Hello and welcome, You are highly likely suffering from plantar fasciitis. Plantar fasciitis is an inflammation of a plantar fascia. The fascia lies directly beneath the skin on the bottom of your foot and connects your heel bone to your toes. The diagnosis is made after clinical examination of your foot and X-ray may be ordered to rule out other causes of foot pain. Usually proper lifestyle modifications and simple conservative treatment helps to cure the majority of patients with plantar fasciitis. The treatment includes the followings:-avoid activities that make pain worse such running or other activities that put high pressure on foot. -you can continue putting ice or bio-freeze for 15-20 mins 3 times a day.-use splints at night to make the fascia relaxed. Night splints make toes pointed up and applies a constant, gentle stretch to the plantar fascia. It also stretches the Achilles tendon at the back of the heel, preventing it from contracting. Night splints can be used every night until the pain is gone. -you can browse the internet or ask your doctor about special exercises for plantar fasciitis.-your doctor may also prescribe non-steroidal anti-inflammatory Chat Doctor. Usually the majority of patients improve within 6 months with the conservative treatment. Surgical treatment can be considered only after 12 months of unsuccessful non-surgical treatment. I hope the above information will be helpful for you. Please, feel free to ask me if there is anything else you need to know. Thank you, Malik Among MD

This is because closely opposing body folds e.g. finger webs, thighs and groin, maxilla, submammary folds etc. can trap sweat, heat and moisture, therefore making the area favorable for fungal proliferation. If I was the treating doctor I would have asked you to use a topical antifungal like clotrimazole/ketoconazole/fluconazole cream, twice daily, regularly for 4 weeks. Since you are already using an Oral antifungal e.g. oral terminating once daily. I would suggest you to continue with it for 4-6 weeks for a more complete urban OTC antihistamine e.g. cetirizine 10 mg once daily would help you in symptomatic itch relief. Keeping the folds Chat Doctor. Regards

It seems to work pretty well, but a few months ago the dr. added Strattera in addition to this.  We still supervise and assist with his tooth brushing in the morning and at night but his teeth are turning more and more yellow.

Presence of contrast-enhancement on MRI lesions may indicate an active disease. Your neurologist would be in a better position to interpret the MRI abnormalities. I hope my answer helps.

Patient: I have been having right side abdominal pain all day that been getting worse. it seems to be the worst when I push to the left of my hip bone (my left looking down) and up a little bit it also is in my back in the same area. Now what concerning me most is when i sit down the pain gets worse.  Doctor: Hi! Good evening. I am Chat Doctor answering your query. Even though it needs a clinical examination of your abdomen to arrive at a tentative diagnosis, from the history alone of your symptoms, this seems to be an inflammatory condition of the intro abdominal organs and if it is on the right side, appendix and gall bladder top the list. If I were your doctor, I would advise you for a complete blood count, a stool test for ova and cyst, a urine routine and microscopic test, and an ultrasound of the abdomen to rule out such and other related conditions so that appropriate treatment could be planned. Till then, you could go for an anti-spasmodic along with a proton pump inhibitor Chat Doctor. I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts.

Patient: Hello! My name is Maxine, I`m 26 and I have some questions concerning thyroid cancer and birth control. I was diagnosed with papillary thyroid cancer 10 months ago and had a full thyroidectomy . So far I have received 145 mci of RAI, 100 of which were given for treating lymph node metastasis . There are some undifferenciated areas on my CT scans (neck and mediastinum ) so I`m still in the status of a cancer patient. My therapy is 150 micrograms of Euthyrox. I`m considering starting another birth control measure in addition to using condoms. Is it problematic to use hormonal birth control while on Euthyrox, especially if the cancer is still present in the form of metastasis? I would appreciate your help, thank you.  Doctor: Dear, you are being given Eutheria 150mcg daily so that you are not thyroid efficient and to great a feeling in the body as if thyroid was not removed. So you can use hormonal contraceptives like a normal person would have used it with no problems. Had you not been on replacement therapy, hypothyroidism itself acts as a birth control measure? Regarding your thyroid malignancy you may have to undergo RAI uptake study again as per the advice of your physician to rule out the complete ablation of your disease. Truly,

Your symptoms may indicate postcholecystectomy syn Chat Doctor.  It also includes the development of symptoms caused by removal of the gallbladder (e.g., gastritis and diarrhea). In general, PCS is a preliminary diagnosis and should be renamed with respect to the disease identified by an adequate workup. It arises from alterations in bile flow due to loss of the reservoir function of the gallbladder. Two types of problems may arise. The first is continuously increased bile flow into the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract, which may contribute to esophagitis and gastritis. The second is related to the lower GI tract, where diarrhea and colicky lower abdominal pain may resultTreatment should be governed by the specific diagnosis made and may include pharmacologic or surgical approaches. First, you should do gastrostomy and ct scan to rule out other diagnoses and then treatment can be planned. I hope I have answered you query. If you have any further questions you can contact us in every time. Kindly regards. Wish you a good health.
Patient: Hi, I have manic depression and I have had plenty of treatment, but I just don t feel I am getting better, I will admit that I thought I was doing well at one stage but then I nearly lost my dad in a heart operation and I just went spiraling back down into the dark cloud again. My family, friends and work colleagues think I am doing better, I tell people that I am doing better just so they stop worrying about me, but honestly I have never been so bad, all I think about is my own death and how no one would care.

Do I need to have some kind of laser treatment or what? Thanks.  Doctor: Hello! Welcome on Chat Doctor ! The chronic back pain could be related to a wrong posture or prolonged sitting position. For this reason, I would first recommend performing an X-ray of the spinal column (cervical, thoracic and lumbar regions). A spine MRI may be necessary. If everything is OK, I would recommend trying physiotherapy, to help correct your posture and reinforce your back muscles. Hope you will find this answer helpful! Best wishes,

Take analgesic or anti-inflammatory

Patient: Hi, my wife is expected and after having a ultrasound in the 28th week of pregnancy, there were extrarenal pelvis - right kidney 5.8 and left kidney 4.4. I want to know how safe this after birth and is there any harm of this extrarenal pelvis. Please give me detailed information regarding extrarenal pelvis in kidney of fetus.  Doctor: Hello, and I hope I can help you today. An extrarenal pelvis is a variation of the anatomy of the kidneys which is actually found in about 10% of the population. It is absolutely no long-term medical consequences, but it can be confused with other types of urinary obstruction which do not have as good a prognosis therefore it is always important to monitor it if it is seen in a fetus to make sure it is not another more dangerous diagnosis like urinary obstruction. So there are no consequences of the babies health by having an extrarenal pelvis. Many people who have this condition are not diagnosed until they have a test such as an ultrasound of the kidney or CAT scan for another reason and have never had any symptoms over the course of their lifetime. So there's no reason to worry further about the health of your baby because of the extrarenal pelvis. I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was reassuring. Best wishes to you and your wife for the rest of the pregnancy,
Patient: I am a 48 year old femail. Two months of severe migraines that wake me up in the middle of the night only. Imitrex helps. MRI states: White matter: There are 2 small T2 hyperintense lesions in the white matter. There is a lesion in the anterior aspect of the right frontal lobe and a lesion along the periventricular margin of the left lateral ventricl in the left frontal lobe. Early chronic microvasular disease and demyelination could have a similar appearance. No evidence of an intracranial mass, hemorrrhage or acute ischemia . What now? Where can I look for more treatment? Is there treatment?  Doctor: Hi, welcome to Chat Doctor.  Such hyperintense signals are commonly seen in brain.  It is just an age related changes in brain due to microvascular origin.  You need not worry about that. Otherwise, MRI is completely normal.  Migraine is not related to brain parenchymal at all. You need to continue your routine medication for migraine.  Hope I have answered your query.  Regards.

Patient: How should I wait before having my gall bladder removed? Was hospitalized a week ago with fever. Could I simply change my diet (seriously) and just not have the surgery? How much is this consult costing me? Not sure if I trust the pending surgery in a few weeks. Should I seek a second opinion? Ann  Doctor: Hi.how frequent are the occurrence of your symptoms? High fat/ high cholesterol food intake is a predisposing factor to formation of your gallstones. Based from your course of the disease description, you may have a chronic calculus cholecystitis. This means that your gallstones may have been there for a long time already, and the symptoms are intermittent in presentation, usually bouts of colicky attack/pain or feeling of belatedness occurs after a fatty food intake. This is an not emergency case, but you have to have a sense of urgency in dealing with this matter, as it may be converted to an acute attack which will be emergent to deal with. Low fat diet is encouraged, along with antispasmodics, prior to surgery to lessen the occurrence of attacks. If you are over 35 y/o and has other co-morbidities/diseases, a cardio-pulmonary evaluation will be requested first, prior to your operation. A consult with a general surgeon is best for clinical evaluation. Diagnostics, such as abdominal ultrasound and liver function tests, will be recommended accordingly. Definitive management is cholecystectomy (removal of gallbladder), laparoscopically, being the gold standard now. The cost is dependent in the institution you are going to. Your surgeon of choice might be of help in that aspect. Hope this helps. Good day!!~ Chat Doctor.
Patient: I have had a number of rashes on various parts of my body since April.  I have tried eliminating anything new, ie lotions, cereal.  I did have skin testing done 3 years ago.  I was recommended to go on a nickel free diet at the time, although I did not.  I found the one product that made my face breakout in a rash and had no further problem until this year.  I have since beginning of Nov cut out many wheat products.  I have some rashes that I treat with a low dose cortisone cream, although that does not seem to be helping my other itches which seem to be more every day??I have looked at the nickel free diet and most of the higher content items I stay away from  Doctor: Hi, Thanks for writing to us. Just from description without looking at the rashes, it is difficult to think of a particular diagnosis. But if its nickel that is leading to your rash, it could be contact allergic dermatitis. Daily use items such as belts with buckles, any ornament etc. contain nickel in varying amounts and can induce body rashes. So you need to avoid that too. Sometimes cortisone cream doesn't work alone as it's quite a mild steroid. Either a potent steroid is required or an oral steroid is required. Also avoiding wheat or any other edible product won't help as it was not the cause of your rash at first place. A visit to a dermatologist is recommended as there could be many causes for generalized body rash apart from allergic dermatitis Hope this helped.
Patient: i am 24 male with crohns disease and i have social anxiety/generalized anxiety/panic attacks, i have no motivation or drive, i cant seem to enjoy things very long,even things i like,i have somewhat of a anger problem like just snapping sometime for no good reason. Does this sound like i could have adhd or something else? (adderall really helps)  Doctor: Hello, Thanks for choosing Chat Doctor for posting your query. I have gone through your question in detail and I can understand what you are going through. Symptoms of ADHD and depression are somewhat similar, and the difference is its pervasiveness. If you are having these non-specific symptoms right from the age of 7 years, and they are continuous at least in 2 settings then you should consider it as an ADHD. However, if these are recent change say since a few months or a year then the more probable diagnosis is depression. I would like to go ahead with the diagnosis of depression in your case. Depression can occur with regular stress, and it can also occur biologically without any stress as well. You need proper treatment for the same. There are various effective therapies for depression like fluoxetine, venlafaxine, bupropion, mirtazapine or Escitalopram, and they are all very effective and mostly safe. You may also require some benzodiazepines like clonazepam or lorazepam for a short period like 2-3 weeks to reduce the anxiety and help with your sleep.  If you are averse to the Chat Doctor.  This therapy is taken by either a psychologist or a psychiatrist in which the therapist identifies impaired cognitions (Thoughts) and try to correct them. They are 15-20 min weekly session and there should be around 8-10 sessions to help you with your illness. Hope I am able to answer your concerns. If you have any further query, I would be glad to help you. In future if you wish to contact me directly, you can use the below-mentioned link:bit.ly/
Patient: I am pretty sure my son has infantile. He just finished wrestling. He is currently treating a spot on his wrist for ringworm. He has in the past on the side of his face used Lucimin 1%. For what they thought was a staff infection. This time he had the crusted over on his ear and now the red spots on the side o f his face. What should he do this time. They did prescribe an oral something last time. I cant seem to get through to him the importance of cleansing that spot three times a day with soap and water. Then use the cream. What do you recommend?  Doctor: Hi thanks for contacting Chat Doctor ...... Noted you have ring worm infection that is fungal infection of superficial tissue........

Patient: Yes, please make sence of my MRI ..... I am a 33 w/m and have already had 2 previous back surgeries at L5 for disk protrusions. I am currently in a lot of pain and this time it is not only isolated to L5, but T11-L1 also. Im wondering if another surgery would be beneficial. My last surgery was 2005 and was a success. 1.) T11-T12 disk protrusion with facet hypertrophy results in minimal canal encroachment. 2). T12-L1 left paracentral disk osteophytic protrusion results in very mild canal stenosis . Some minimal encroachment on the left neural foramen T12-L1. 3). L3-L4 There is mild broad based disk osteophytic bulge, without significant associated canal stenosis. Bilateral facet and ligamentum flavum hypertrophy contribute to mild bilateral neural foraminal stenosis. 4). L4-L5 There is broad base disk osteophytic bulge, without significant associated canal stenosis. Bilateral facet arthropathy and ligamentum flavum hypertrophy contribute to mild to moderate bilateral neural foraminal stenosis. 5). Postsurgical changes again noted with scarring and fibrosis in the right epidural space. There is residual extruded disk fragment inferiorly. There is associated moderate encroachment on the right lateral recess with moderate to severe right neural foraminal stenosis. Facet hypertrophic changes, with lateral disk osteophytic component additionally contribute to moderately severe left neural foraminal stenosis. Impression: Postsurgical changes at L5-S1 with a residual disk fragment inferiorly on the right, as well as fibrosis, with moderate to severe right neural foraminal stenosis. There is also moderate encroachment on the right lateral recess and moderately severe left neural foraminal stenosis at this level. There is mild canal stenosis at both T11-T12 and T12-L1 levels. There is mild to moderate neural foraminal encroachment bilaterally at L4-L5.  Doctor: Hi, Thank you for posting your query. Though you may benefit from surgery at L5-S1 disc level, it should be avoided or delayed. This is because surgery is not easy in patient who has already undergone two previous surgeries. The anatomy is distorted and only an experienced surgeon can succeed. Tere is no need for surgery at T11-T12 level, as the problem is minor. You should undergo physiotherapy and use medications such as pregabalin at present. Best wishes, Chat Doctor.
Patient: For the past several weeks I ve been experiencing a visual and exaggerated pulsing in my left arm, on the inside just below the elbow. It happens randomly and normally lasts less than 15 seconds, then stops. I ve noticed it mostly when I m at work, seated at my desk, but it has also happened in the evenings/weekends. I m a 61 year old female.  Doctor: Hi Dear, Welcome to Chat Doctor. Understanding your concern. As per your query you have pulsating sensation in arms. Well there can be many reasons for symptoms you mention in query like B12 deficiency, multiple Sclerosis, herpes infection, less blood supply and triggered nerve. I would suggest you to apply warm compresses, massage with sesame oily gently, eat healthy add fresh fruits and green vegetables in your diet and give your arm proper rest. Consult orthopedic surgeon if the condition doesn't get well. Doctor may order CR scan or MRI along with physical examination. Doctor may recommend physical therapy which will help a lot along with orthodox MRO, anti-inflammatory and vitamin supplement like vitamin B12. Doctor may also refer you to cardiologist for blood supply problem. Hope your concern has been resolved. Get Well Soon. Best Wishes,

Patient: Can you please tell me what the difference is between a TENS machine and a SCS implant? I have had chronic lower back pain after a injury 8 years ago. I am on Morphine 100mg x 2 daily, and am looking for something to help with the pain besides increasing the dose of meds. Thank you, Lisa  Doctor: Hi, the TENS therapy is a Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, so it is superficial electrical stimulation via the skittle SCS implant is the spinal cord stimulation implant which is placed in the spine under the skin surface. Both helps in stimulation of the nerves and reduce Pain via the pain gate theory. For TENS, you do not need a surgery but for SCS you need Jonathan you
Patient: I worked in a research lab recently . White mice are used. This afternoon I got bitten by a mouse in my finger deeply like a nail causing it to bleed. I squeezed it under running water and applied some alcohol on it and some antibiotic cream but what im still worrying about is the need to receive shots for tetanus and also rabies , my family see it necessary I dont know how to decide , on what criteria . Can i have a specialist advice plz?  Doctor: Hello and thank you for your question. You should not need the rabies vaccine as lab animals are not likely to have rabies. However, if you have not had a tetanus shot in the last 5 years then you should have that done within 72 hours of the bite to protect yourself from tetanus. Tetanus may occur after any puncture wound and getting that vaccination is a good idea. Regards
Patient: Hi, I have experienced flutters in my chest and bottom of throat for a few years now.  It now seems to be stronger, kind of taking my breath away.  A few months ago I had a feeling of almost blacking out.  This happened for four days in a row and was very scary. Now I occasionally feel it slightly but not to the extent I did a few months ago.  When I was 16 I had a lump removed from my thyroid which was benign, and at that time my thyroid was neither overactive nor underactive.  I have eustachian tube dysfunction that never clears.  Could either of these things be related to heart flutters and dizzy/blackout spells?  Doctor: Hello Spirits a very nice question to answer. Indeed this problem has got a lot associated with your thyroid status. But a real thorough examination needs to be done before you start up on your medications

I don t usually have cramps , but today I had pain in my left stomach a few times. I do not have a tampon stuck in me. More back ground on me: I went to an orthopedic two months ago for a reocurring pain in my hip. 6/28 they found out I have follicles on my left ovary and a cyst 4.8x2.6x3.5 cm between my uterus and ovary on my right side. After my vaginal ultrasound the gyne said I was probably ovulating during the test and we ll just watch the cyst in case it grows. A year ago I found out I have a large benign lump in my breast which I will be getting removed. The day my honeymoon began, my eyesight worsened so I had to start wearing my glasses all the time. I m 35, had lasik in 2001, and was diagnosed with cataracts at 21. Four year ago, I had to start wearing glasses to drive at night. Two years ago, I needed them to drive all the time. I ve always been very active and have a healthy diet. I used to smoke but switched to Snus two years ago because now I don t smell. I m on antidepressants, but started weaning myself off them 7/22 with guidance from my doctor. My goal is to try getting pregnant in a year. Is there something wrong with me?  Doctor: Ovarian cyst / follicles etc. can be symptoms of polycystic ovarian disease, where inability to conceive can be a problem.  But, there is effective hormonal treatment available for such conditions Depression, too, sometimes cause delay in conception again causing some hormonal imbalance The cause of cataract at 21 yrs of age need to be evaluated, if any systemic cause, they need to be treated I think treating the three conditions should be possible easily and getting pregnant should not be a major issue
Patient: Hi,Basically I was on a plane earlier this week travelling home, when I got a funny feeling in my chest. At first i thought it was a heart attack, but as I didnt collapse or get any ther symptoms, I presummed not. The problem has persisted, and it feels like a shortness of breath and tightness in my chest. I read up on the problem, and it says it could be a collapsed lung, or Primary spontaneous pneumothorax. I read the cause, and it says it is common in males, young, smokers and can start from a change in atmospheric pressure. I am 21, male, a smoker (sorry, I know, trying to give up), and the plane would explain this. I was wondering if you could give me some advice, as I dont really have lots of free time to visit a doctors, as I have a disserttation in in 2 weeks. Thanks!  Doctor: Hello ! Yes pneumothorax is definitely one of the possibilities. However, it is not the only possibility.  Since you mentioned shortness of breath and chest tightness, even bronchial asthma is a possibility.  Have your ever had similar episodes in the past ? Problems related to your heart cannot be ruled out just because you didn't collapse. The oxygen levels Chat Doctor. You need to be examined by a physician in person. You will need a Chest X-ray, ECG, Spirometry (pre- and post-bronchodilator) for basic cardiorespiratory evaluation.  Treatment needs to be decided based on your final diagnosis.

Patient: I take a combination therapy antihypertensive med called Atacand plus for the past 5 years and I ve noticed a decrease in my memory as well as tiredness and fatigue during the day. Should I try taking the medication at night to see if it helps with these symptoms? I am also a shift worker so my schedule varies but I currently take the med in the morning regardless of what shift I m on. I do find I m more alert in the evenings.  Doctor: Hello, Atacand plus contains an ARB and a diuretic. It's better to avoid the diuretic before sleep. Regarding your symptoms, some of them can be attributed to the Chat Doctor.

Patient: my husband age 53 have been reported with lungs problem ;Defined as small homogenous opacity seen in left lower zone near base close to the left dome of diaphragm (arrows).The doctor suspect it Pneumonitis and prescribed Levodropropizine Rapitus Syrup.I want to ensure it is rightly diagnosed  Doctor: Hi, Dear,Thanks for your query to Chat Doctor. Dear I read your query and reviewed it with context to your query facts. I understood your health concerns and feel Concerned about them. Based on the facts of your query, you seem to suffer from-? Pneumonitis, with ?infective cause or could be from ? Secondary to Lump in basal segments of the left lung. The Syrup would only control the irritation unproductive-? Or productive cough with this lesion. To ensure right diagnosis I would suggest following Dos for you case-Check Sputum for causal bacteria / AFB/Malignant or benign cells. Check X-ray Lung with PA and Oblique views to get assess the exact location of the opacity in the left lung. Response to Course of Antibiotics(Augmenting Cap 650 mg x 1 x 2 times per day x 10 days) would decide further investigation by Bronchoscopic studies. AS there is no history of infective complaints with your husband, I would suggest assessment by Fiberoptic-Brohchoscopy with study of lavage for AFB and Malignant and benign cells from the suspected lump in the basal bronchial lumen. My Impression-As the homogenous opacity with no infective complaints is there, (as asked from your doctors script of anti-cough and antihistamines), Adenoma of the Bronchus ? Malignant Lesion needs to be kept in mind and ruled out by the above investigations. It could also be due to atelectasis of the lung from blockage of the lower basal bronchial lumen or could be just a progressing and developing Pre-Pneumonia consolidation developing in to full-blown pneumonia in your case. All these possibilities need to be kept in mind while treating your husbands case.Hence, For the age of your Husband, This is a serious thing to be suspected and need to be investigated further. I would hence suggest you to Consult with Chest Physician or Chest Surgeon who would assess your husbands' case on above lines and would plan needful treatment accordingly. Hope this reply would enlighten you on If your case needs further diagnosis or not. Hope this reply would help you to plan further treatment with your doctors there. Welcome for any further query in this regard. Good Day!! Chat Doctor. N. Senior Surgical Specialist. S. Genl-CVTS
Patient: I am 28.5 weeks pregnant. My due date is 22 April 2011. I remember the beginning of my last period to be 10 July 2010. I would like to find out my conception date. I had unprotected sex with a different person on the 18th of July and with my partner on the...  Doctor: Hallow Madam, I hope I can be of help to you today. The due date of delivery (DD) is calculated by a formula DD= Last Menstrual Period date (LMP) + 9 months + 7 days. Since you had your LMP on 10 July 2010, the DD would be on 17 April 2011. If DD provided to you is by ultrasonography, a variation of one week is acceptable as Ultrasonography calculated DD is by the size of the baby and is calculated from the date of conception. To calculate the date of egg release (ovulation), it happens 14 days before the next expected menses. So considering your menstrual cycle of 30 or 31 days, next menses would be on 10 August and ovulation would be on 28 July 2010. The life of an egg is 24 hours and the sperms are active for 72 hours. Hence, a period of one week around the ovulation is fertile period. So your fertile period would be 24 July to 1 August. Thus, the conception would be in that period. Now in this calculation, you have to make some modifications depending on the periodicity of your menstrual cycle. Then you can locate your fertile period of that cycle. Thus, the intercourse(s) during this fertile period are likely to cause the pregnancy. If you had a solitary intercourse during fertile period, that day or within 4 days of that day would be the day of conception. Of course this all is based on the clinical calculations. If you want to ascertain the paternity of your child for any legal cause, you may go for DNA test which would be a foolproof evidence. I hope this helps you.

Patient: Hi, My son is 2yrs 7 months. He is suffering from cough with wheezing (repeated infections since past one and half months). Initially he was on nebulization and the doctor prescribed Azithral for 5 days.He recovered a bit and again after 4/5 days the same situation of persistent cough and wheezing continued. We got the blood test done. His eosinophilia is 20%. Doctor has prescribed for LIvolin syrup and Banoside syrup (3ml twice daily for 20 days).Please advice.  Doctor: Hello welcome to Chat Doctor , Based on your children history and treatment received most likely reason for his cough seems to be allergic (reactive airway disease), chances of which are more if there is family history of allergic also.

Inhalation therapy are best recommended treatment for such type of cough, also you need to check your immunization, apart from routine vaccines he needs yearly flu vaccination.

Patient: Hi, I have a blister like inside my mouth and it is in the inside part of my cheek, it is very small and not visible but I can feel it with my tongue, it has been there for more than a year now it never goes away and every time i get pain right in front of my ears that blister gets really big like huge, and at times i feel numbness on one side of my face but the shooting pain its almost always there on my face. I dont know if all this is related or they are symptoms from different conditions. I dont know what to do every time i go to a doctor, the doctor says "I cant see or feel anything with my finger like a blister inside the mouth", but as i said earlier its not visible but i feel it with my tongue and it gets huge and then goes back to its normal size again. The pain is very sharp. What could it be? I am afraid its nothing cancerous related. Please advise  Doctor: Tithe blister like feeling that you can sense through your tone might be the parotid papilla. The parotid gland (the gland around your ear opens into the oral cavity on the inner surface of the cheek, usually opposite the maxillary second molar tooth) and its duct are associated with the main nerve of your face (the facial nerve) . Any swelling /stone /enlargement /abnormality in the gland/salivary duct associated, can lead to unnecessary stimulation of the nerve and lead to the pain that you have mentioned usually in the area around the ear. Please visit an oral physician to rule out the above and note the precise time of pain and any stimulant associated (like immediately after meals, the swelling might subside), oral Chat Doctor.  Hope this could be of some help. Take care,
Patient: Had root canal on last molar 12 days ago - 1.5 hrs. in chair with mouth open - TMJ flaired up and now have trismus.  Cant open mouth more than 1 finger - cant chew - headache and earache all the time - cant even brush teeth.  Hurts to chew anything at all.  Am losing weight from not eating.  Endodontist said there was no infection in the tooth he did the root canal on, but regular dentist prescribed antibiotic and muscle relaxer -- both of which make me nauseous, and make headache worse, and give me diarhrrea without helping at all with the pain. Am doing cold compresses every 15 min. and exercising jaw as much as I can.  How long will I have to go on like this and what more can I do.  I cant get crown on root canal tooth until I can open my mouth.  I also have bruxism.  Doctor: Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query. The limited mouth opening and pain could be because of opening your mouth for long time and bruise leading to disc displacement in the Temporomandibular joint. Consult an oral physician and get it diagnosed. You can take anti-inflammatory Chat Doctor.  You can also take muscle relaxants like chlorzoxazone. Furthermore, you can give hot fomentation over the joints. Do not eat hard things, do not open your mouth too wide. Take soft diet. Give rest to the joint. For nausea and omitting you can take an antacid like sanitizing and risperidone respectively. If all these won't work, then you have to get a splint done. I hope my answer will help you, take care.
Patient: Hi my name is Carole. I went to the dentist last Tuesday. I had a small filling put in one of my back teeth. He numbed it with a Ligmaject. He numbed it pretty good and said I wouldnt feel that tooth for awhile. It has been a week and my gum on that side was swollen on that side up until yesterday. Along with the swelling I have bad pain in my gums all the way around it that meds arent touching.The pain was in my ear and throat are gone now but the bad pain is still in my gums. The tooth doesnt hurt at all and still feels numb at times. What could be the problem?.  Doctor: Hi, Thanks for asking the query, According to your clinical symptoms I suspect that you have developed infection of the gums this could be due to periodontal abscess arriving from the infected tooth to confirm this you need to visit the Dentist and get an x-ray done, such type of infected tooth is treated with root canal treatment to save it permanently. Either it can be a gingival abscess due to accumulation of bacterial plague and calculus deep in the gum pockets. Go for symptomatic treatment of complete mouth scaling and polishing. Take a course of antibiotics and analgesics. Take lukewarm saline and antiseptic mouthwash rinses. Take care.
Patient: I am a nearly 40 year old female...I was diagnosed with Sarcoidosis about 3 years ago through a right breast biopsy...when I was 22 I had an ablation for Wolfe Parkinson White Syndrome, I have had pericarditis and recently diagnosed with chronic lung disease and AFib with Syncope...I am now suffering with a lump under my left armpit and it is extremely painful and have some moderate left sided chest pain that radiates into my armpit on exhillation...could this be related to Sarcoid. i know it can affect the lymphatic system but so far it has not been involved. I also have an implanted loop recorder and was wondering if maybe that is causing some of my problems...any ideas would be appreciated...I am scheduled for an ultrasound of that armpit in the near future but was wondering if I should be worried especially with the chest pain...Thanks so much.  Doctor: The lump under the forearm could be a gland. It could be due to infection since it is painful. It could also be due to acidosis. An ultrasound is a must and if required, a fine needle aspiration biopsy should also be done to arrive at a diagnosis.
Patient: My 11 month old has has chronic nasal congestion for 9 months with no relief from anything...antibiotics, humidifier, vapor rubs, hot steam, etc... wha can you suggest? Could it be mold in my home? Are there any natural ways to clear this congestion up? The pediatrician thinks the contant mucas is causing ear infections..HELP!!!  Doctor: Thanks for consulting at Chat Doctor. Chronic nasal congestion in kids commonly occurs due to infections, allergies, irritants, enlarged adenoids etc. Chronic nasal congestion causes blockage of Eustachian tube which causes ear problems. Clear watery nasal discharge, rashes, sneezing may suggest some allergic cause. Sticky, yellowish nasal discharge, post nasal Chat Doctor. As you have already completed courses of antibiotics, I would suggest you avoid exposure to possible allergens, use nasal decongestants and oral antihistamines and arrange consultation with ENT specialist. He will do detailed clinical examination of nose, hypopharynx, throat and ear to determine the exact cause.

Patient: I am a 41 year old female that was diagnosed with Pericardial effusion almost 2 years ago... drained finally after approximately 3 months, continue to have small amount of fluid around heart, have dealt with many irregular beats since as well, including bigiminy and trigiminy (sorry about spelling), i have a whooshing sound in ear for a couple of years now as well... I have lost approximately 50 pounds and many inches in the last six months and that isn t easy for me as I have tried to lose weight for years with no success as I am surgical menopausal since I was 34 as well as hypothyroid for approx 15 years. ... the worst thing is now I seem to have developed a heart murmur... no one can figure all of this out and it is getting frustrating. I hope you can give me some suggestions. thanks from a frustrated, fatigued woman. Sheryl.  Doctor: Fluid accumulation around the heart may occur alone but also as part of other illnesses. Be sure that you are clear with your doctor as to the source of fluid accumulation. A murmur is a sound heard as the heart beats. It may occur as a result of some of the problems that cause fluid accumulation around the heart, as a problem with a heart valve or as a variation of normal. The studies that are done to look at fluid accumulation will also see the heart valves. If no severe problem is uncovered, these are probably not the primary source of your symptoms. For someone like yourself, I will usually screen of systemic problems like the thyroid disorder that someone already found. Discuss what has been done with your doctor and consider additional screening for more widespread inflammatory illnesses.
Patient: Yes, I have recently recovered from a cold and during the cold I was given a antibiotic that I soon found out I was allergic to. I was treated for the allergy in the ER and given a different antibiotic. The reaction I had was a narrowed esophagus and I could bearly breathe. That was a couple of weeks ago and I have since recovered from the cold but now I am experiencing severe pain in my chest if I sneeze , cough, and I even get short of breath easily when climbing a single flight of stairs. I m not sure what to make of this but it feels like my lungs are going to explode when I cough/sneeze???  Doctor: Hi, Let me ad Chat Doctor.  1. I hope you have completed the course of second antibiotic, which you are not allergic to. 2. If you have completed the course, then make sure that you are not taking any other medications. Since, medications usually cause heavy breathing, shortness of breath, it is better to avoid any medicines as such unless they are required. 3. I do not know your age, I am sorry. However, it is advisable to get an EKG done to look for the cardiac status. 4. Repeat a chest X-ray now and look for signs of residual congestion on the lung fields. 5. It is better to consult a pulmonologist and get bronchodilators prescribed (IF required only). Hope this helps. Get well soon.
Patient: 9 month old has run fever of up to 104 for 4 days. The fever broke yesterday and now rectal temp has been all over the place, from 97-98.6. The 97 scares me. Isn t that too low? I should also mention that there was no known cause found for fever. WBC was high. Over 20,000.  Doctor: Hello. I just read through your question. It is very reassuring that the temperature came down. The reading of 97 is nothing to be concerned about. The white blood cell count of 20,000 indicates that there was an infection, but based on the resolution of the high fever, appears to be a harmless virus. It would be worth considering with your pediatrician doing a repeat blood count to make sure it normalized. In any case, however, the illness is resolving.

First discharge from vagina is due to infection and dysmenorrhoea may be due to many reasons like endometriosis. This needs to be examined by gynecologist and ultrasound of pelvis with microscopic examination of discharge is needed for starting treatment.  Back pain with lower limb radiation may be due to disc prolapse in lumbar area. This needs to be investigated with X-rays of lumbosacral spine anteroposterior and lateral views. Meanwhile, start tab regain x 75 mg one at bedtime. If X-ray report is abnormal please consult orthopedic surgeon nearby your area. Chances of urinary tract infection is less likely.
Patient: I am 60 yrs old male. wt 85 kg ht 5 7 living in a hill station. While walking upward I feel heavy breathing and choking of throat. Then after a short rest able to walk slowly. and then this process is repeated. No problem in walking in plain areas. Last week angiography was done which is normal. I have been prescribed tablet Revelol XL25. Pl advise what is trouble and is it the right medicine for my problem.  Doctor: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. Revelon XL 25 is metoprolol which is beta blocker. It will help you in this situation. Since your coronary angiography is normal, I don't think any cardiac disease is the cause for your current symptoms. So Beta blocker will not help you. In my opinion you should consult pulmonologist and get done PFT (pulmonary function test) to rule out bronchitis. As your symptoms like breathlessness on exertion is seen in Bronchitis. So better to rule out this. You may need inhaled bronchodilators and short course of antibiotics. So consult pulmonologist and discuss all these. Don't take Revlon XP 25. It will not help you.
Patient: my mom is in hospital after going into respiratory failure two weeks ago. she spent eleven days in icu and is on three different antibiotics for pseudomas bacteria. she has copd her feet are swollen really badly she is getting lasix, she is also on oxygen. her white blood count is elevated and she had a chest xray yesterday i think to hopefully rule out pneumonia, she is not eating well either. she is scared, so am i.  Doctor: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Respiratory failure causes right sided heart damage and failure. Right side of heart receives blood from the body. So when it fails, venous return is hampered and so fluid accumulates in gravity dependent parts like legs. So this is the reason for swollen feet. So she will need higher dose of Las ix and additional diuretic (spironolactone). Fluid restriction (less than 1.5 liters per day) and salt restriction are also advisable. Limb elevation in bed also helps in the regressing edema. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your mother. Thanks.

Patient: Two months back I had the upper lip swollen with apparently no cause; there was slite itching before the swelling started; there was no pain; the swelling lasted for a day. After a few days, there was a similar case of swelling which also lasted for a day; then about a month later, the lower lip got swollen; and then the foreskin of the penis got swollen, which also lasted for a day; now I have the right cheek swollen. I am 76 years old, and my health is quite o.k. I have no blood-suger problem, or blood-pressure problem  Doctor: Hello, Swelling with itching might be due to some allergy you are having.

Welcome and thank you for asking on Chat Doctor! Regarding your concern, I would explain that your symptoms are related to these substances.

But when taken for a long time they can cause irreversible changes to your heart and blood vessels. Hope you will find this answer helpful! Kind regards,
Patient: hello im 15 and male i have rarely brushed my teeth and i am ashamed as they are yellow and need sorting out i have tried brushing for the past month and a half and have seen no improvment and my gums are still bleeding. i am going away on thursday and was wondering would a private dentist be able to whiten my teeth or give me treatment before i go thanks  Doctor: Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query. The bleeding in the oral cavity could be because of the gum infection, or any cuts in the oral cavity or pulp polyp or any bleeding disorders like idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. Since you are giving history of poor oral hygiene, it looks like the bleeding is arising secondary to gum infection. The yellowish color of the teeth can be secondary to the deposits like calculus. Consult an oral physician and get these things ruled out. Get a complete blood investigation along with INR to rule out the bleeding disorders. If any gum infection then get your teeth cleaned and use topical gum astringents like stolen gum paint. If pulp polyp is there then get it root canal treated. If bleeding disorder is there then consult a general physician. A normal or regular dentist can treat the gum infection and make the teeth appear white by doing scaling and polishing. I hope my answer will help you, take care.
Patient: hey docter...my uncle is suffering from severe stomach pain......he had his x-rays which say that there are some cancerous cells in the liver including a thrombus in the left portal vein.i live in Pakistan and i am really worried about him. He is 63 years old. Please guide me before this matter becomes more serious and tell me if there is any way to save his life.Thank you  Doctor: Hello, I can understand your concern for your uncles healthTreatment for liver cancer depend on size, location, involvement of nearby structures, involvement of vascular structures and distant spread.

Based on all these question treatment for liver cancer range from surgery for tumor removal or part of liver removal, chemotherapy, intervention procedures (radio frequency ablation of tumor, direct injection of chemotherapy and embolization in branch of hepatic artery which supply blood to tumor).Thus, treatment options are wide, and they are based on stage of tumor with good results from early stage of tumor

Patient: yesterday i was very dizzy and very weak and it started getting hard to swallow. Today i am still dizzy and my lymph nodes are very swollen. Ive also been wheezing, I coughed up a little blood today also. Ive been coughing up mucus and my nose has been runny. I have also had a fever of 101 and i still get dizzy and weak. My chest hurts very bad when i cough too.  I am 14 years old.What do i have??!?! :(  Doctor: Hi dear. What you have, could be a simple respiratory infection caused by a virus, like Jackie for example, which has tropism for respiratory tract. At first, many viral infections cause, fever, cough (with a little of blood, because of the force, when you cough) and chest pain (because of a viral pericarditis, which is normal in some type of virus). But if you keep with symptoms, and fever for 5 days or more, you should make a blood test (hologram), and a radiography to find out the severity of the infection. I hope this helps you, and get good soon! :)
Patient: hello sir i am 32 year old lady who was using diprovate-rd for 5years but recently i stopped using it as i was getting lot of pimples so my skin doctor suggested to stop using it as my skin has become very sensitive. he told me that i need around 3 months to come out of its effect. but i am very sad as i have lost the glow on my face at the same time i have got many rashes on my face. i do not want to use diprovate any more.tell me will my face will become normal.

If further any question I will help. Good luck.
Patient: I have been having lower back pain with shooting pain in both legs. Also have been having bouts with diarrhea several times weekly with pain in the lower part of belly right above the pelvic bone. I am wondering if these two things might be related.  Doctor: Hi I am Chat Doctor. .  In my opinion you have a kind of sciatica due to nerve compression, actually these two symptoms are not related, but bowel movements may exaggerate the pain sensation.  For my patients I may recommend physiotherapy, hot massages, spinal straightening exercises will be helpful, painkillers like Advil tabs when needed, gentle massaging with anti-inflammatory gels, B12 vitamin supplements, muscle relaxants will be effective for most of the cases, in more severe and chronic cases steroid tabs or injections are prescribed.  If pain persists I recommend MRI scan on your spine to exclude any spinal disc herniation and follow them up with your neurologist for proper evaluation and management. Please click and consider a 5-star rating with some positive feedback if the information was helpful. Wish you good health, Any further clarifications feel free to ask.

Patient: I had a complete blood picture along with some other blood tests due to chest pain symptoms. All tests were fine but the RBC and WBC showed slightly low levels. The cardiologist I saw said this was likely due to a previous virus (although I have had no complaints) I am also experiencing a lot of headaches and fatigue should I go any further with investigations or just put it down to low immunity right now. Its written Normochromic anaemia and WBC shows leucopenia?  Doctor: Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You have anemia and leukemia.

Patient: Dear doctor this is for a ckd patient. Our scan report says right kidney size 10 .2 x 3.6 centimetres and left left kidney sizes 8.9 x 3. 3 centimetres both kidneys are normal in size and shape and position no calculus in the kidneys and cortico medullary differenciation poorly decreased. can it be treated? and how? And also says no as cities, no pleural effusion.  Doctor: Hello, I have gone through your query and understand your concern. In Ultrasound, the cortex (outer portion of the kidney) and medulla (inner portion) can be differentiated due to specific cellular and tissue structures. But due to any long-standing medical conditions which caused chronic kidney disease, can result in tissue changes, with reduced renal function, and this results in appearance of both the cortex and medulla as similar zones and cannot be separately identified. This is called decreased Cortico-medullary differentiation. Treatment in such a condition, would be to treat or control the underlying cause like Hypertension, diabetes etc. For the chronic kidney disease. Take all the medications prescribed by your treating nephrologist, Reduce your sodium intake. Exercise regularly. Do not smoke or use tobacco. Do not Chat Doctor. Hope this helps. Please write back for further queries. Wishing you good health.

Patient: I went to my PCP for a cold and was given anti-biotics and steroids for my cough and wheezing.  I took the steroids completely, and have three days of anti-biotics left.  I now am still coughing and have a metallic taste from it. Is there something else wrong? Should I go back to doctor?  Doctor: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Yes, you should definitely consult pulmonologist for your symptoms because possibility of post infectious bronchitis is more in your case. Bronchitis (inflammation of airways) is common after viral upper respiratory tract infection (URI) like cold. Your persistent cough and wheezing are due to bronchitis. Best treatment for bronchitis is inhaled treatment. Since you are not taking inhaled treatment, you are not improving. So consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (pulmonary function test). PFT will not only diagnose bronchitis, but it will also tell you about severity of the disease and treatment is based on severity only. You will need inhaled bronchodilator (formoterol or albuterol) and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) (budesonide or fluticasone). Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.
Patient: Back in 1972, after having pneumonia for about a month, I came down with Guillian Barre Syndrome. I am really blessed though. I m now able to walk, talk, and even live on my own. I ve had alot of mental and physical prob- lems over the years, but I guess that s expected. I m just curious if any findings have been found over the years of what exactly causes it, and if doctors are any closer to curing it yet.  Doctor: Guillain Barre Syn Chat Doctor.  The immune system identifies the protein of these bacteria as foreign and correctly targets it for destruction.  However, it just so happens that the protein contained in the coverings of nerves (myelin) which control skeletal muscles is very similar to this foreign protein of the bacteria.  The immune system then, MISTAKENLY begins attacking the myelin sheaths because of this error in recognizing the body as itself vs. a foreign invader. That is how GBS is initiated. There have been other advances in treatment since 1972, most notably the introduction and use of something known as IVG. This makes treatment much easier compared to plasmapheresis which is what you may have gotten in 1972, although it is not known to be a significantly BETTER treatment. Nor is it cheaper. If anything it is probably more expensive. Glad you're better and recovered. Just avoid that C.jejune critter if you can!  All the best!
Patient: hello Dr. I am rubella +59.2 & cmv reactive 184.6 ,hsv 34.9,toxo is non reactive thare are present valu I has my 2nd ovulation pl tell wat shal I do now. now I hav spyramaicin of 21 days cords Dr.says be hopeful but not sure that next it will not happen again.  Doctor: Hi there, I have understood your concern. First do not panic. It is not clear from your reports that the values are for Egg or IGM antibodies. If these values are for Egg antibodies, then you need not worry. It indicates past infection.  Also, as your Toxoplasmosis values negative there is no need to take Tobramycin. Only if IGM antibodies are positive, then you need to wait for 3 Months. Repeat the tests and once IGM values are negative, you can plan to get pregnant. I will suggest you to opt for a healthy diet and regular exercise regimen. Include more portions of fruits, salads and vegetables in daily diet.  Chat Doctor.  Avoid deep-fried foods,bakery products and refined sugars. Use of vitamin B 12 and Folic acid supplements at least 3 months before you plan to get pregnant is advisable. This helps to prevent many problems during pregnancy and delivery. I hope this answer helps you. Thanks.

Patient: What happens when they can no longer find a place to put the port for dialysis? My friend is 57 years old and weighs between 69 and 80 pounds. She is in poor health. She is an alcoholic, has an eating disorder and has just suffered from one of those broken heart attacks. Now the fistula in her arm where they do dialysis is no longer working and the doctors said that was the last place they could use. She is in ICU at a local hospital and they are temporarily giving her dialysis through the chest. What will happen now???  Doctor: Hi, I can understand your concerns. Please be assured that there are other ways of doing the dialysis. These include:1. Putting a permanent catheter through a neck vein. This is inserted under the skin in upper chest and neck area.2. Using surgical techniques called transposition of vein or using a synthetic graft (artificial tube) to create a fistula in the arm.3. Using peritoneal dialysis - inserting a tube into the abdomen and doing dialysis by filling and emptying abdomen periodically using dialysis fluid. I am available to guide you further if you need any clarification. Wish your friend a speedy recovery from the current condition and good health,

Patient: Ive been waking up with about a teaspoon of blood in my mouth. It seems to come from the back of throat or wisdom teeth area.  Whatever it is it drains from somewhere at night. My mouth looks good in side but I am concerned.  Why does it drain only while I sleep?  Doctor: Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query. The bleeding in the oral cavity could be because of the gum infection around wisdom tooth, or any cuts in the oral cavity or pulp polyp or any bleeding disorders like idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. Consult an oral physician and get these things ruled out. Get a complete blood investigation along with INR to rule out the bleeding disorders. If any gum infection then get your teeth cleaned and use topical gum astringents like stolen gum paint. If pulp polyp is there then get it root canal treated. If bleeding disorder is there then consult a general physician. I hope my answer will help you, take care.

Patient: I have been in severe pain . All symptoms point to gallbladder problem. Had a hepatobiliary imaging done today. Results as follows:- Following administration of Ensure(drink) rapid contraction of gallbladder initially. At 28 minutes 63% of the activity in the gallbladder has been expelled.  Impression: gallbladder ejection fraction is 63%, normal.No cystic common bile duct obstruction.          This sounds to me like my doctor is going to tell me " everything looks fine" I can tell you Im NOT fine. This pain is excruciating! Can a person still have a gallbladder problem even if its still functioning at 63%?  Doctor: Hello, I have gone through your query and understood your concern.

Avoid taking potato, other tubers, tomato, egg, chicken, and seafoods, till the pains are completely cleared.  Wishing for a quick and complete recovery. Thank you.

Patient: Im 37 yrs old married for 1 yr.On my 1st icsi long protocol attempt.My cycle was very regular ever since.My fsh 6.9,lh 4.7 both on D3. My progesterone 14& i was on duphaston for 3 months.My Amh 0.9 ng/ml which fell in normal category according to lab refrences.I was down regulated on D21 by decapeptyle 0.1mg daily and my blood works showed reduced desired results of lh, prolactine, progesterone and E2 after 14 days of down regulation.I started stimms the following day by 4 powdered ampules of menogon on 4 liquid ampules, my Folliculometry on D8 showed only 2 folloicles one on each side measuring about 11mm.my DR. said Im a poor responder and this may be due to poor ovarian reserve and increased the dose of menogon to 6 powdered ampules in 2 liquid, and added if there is no more than 2 follicles on D12,I will councelled wether to cancel the cycle or to proceed after measuring serum E2.Am I really diagnosed as poor responder??What do you advice me to do???I am so frustrated.  Doctor: Dear user, welcome to Chat Doctor. Never lose hope and be patient. There are many cases which are worse than yours. If the follicles are mature (18-22 mm), and the endometrium is laminar and around 10 mm thick, you may proceed for ovum pickup but the results this cycle are not promising. If you are obese try to optimize your body mass index (BMI), and next time you should start with 6 powder per day and see what happens. If there is no response there are other maneuvers so don't lose hope. I wish you good luck and getting pregnant soon.

Patient: I m 26 year old female who is currently 24 wks pregnant. I started having sudden symptoms of a swollen tongue, and noticed whites spots almost like a growth on the sides of my tonguem I also noticed swelling n my throat & some difficulty swallowing. - do have a tooth that is in need of a root canal, & one that is roke in hlf & and my gums have now grown over the other covering the hole, it may b infected due to that, but is that the cause? & is there anything I can do while pregnant to treat the problem.  Doctor: Hello have read your query and understand your concerns. Root canal is not really have a direct effect on the fetus during pregnancy. Although the film(x-ray) is necessary to examine the tooth, but the radiation in question is minimal and x-rays are directed towards the mouth and not the abdomen. Other possible sources of risk associated with root canal treatment are: anesthesia. Dentists often use small amount of anesthesia to pregnant women. But if the dose is not sufficient to alleviate the pain of the patient, the dose may be increased gradually. As the tension of the dental procedure has a detrimental effect on the baby, additional anesthesia is preferable to allow the stress affects the baby. The antibiotics. They are often prescribed to fight infection after dental procedure. However, doctors do not prescribe antibiotics that are not safe for pregnant women. As far as swollen gums are concern that can be related to pregnancy gingivitis.to prevent pregnancy gingivitis it is especially important to practice good oral hygiene habits, which include brushing at least twice a day, flossing once a day, and using an antimicrobial mouth rinse. If you are due for a professional cleaning, don't skip it simply because you are pregnant. Hope this ans helpsRegards

Patient: I have been diagnosed with multi minicore disease, an apparently rare genetic condition. Although I am now 71 years old, this condition was not diagnosed in me until I was in my late 60s when I consulted my GP regarding my sudden inability to hold my head up because of neck muscle weakness. A muscle biopsy was performed in December 2013 resulting in the above diagnosis. I have been trying to locate a neck brace or collar which will allow me to hold my head up in a normal position, as at the present time I must either force my head up by forcing my chin up with my fist or the open palm of my hand. I have tried a Miami J collar which was promising but was damaged to the point of semi-uselessness by the weight of my head causing buckling of one of the side supports. I was given an Aspen collar by the orthotist to whom I was referred, but it is so uncomfortable that I cannot use it for more than half an hour at a time without unacceptable levels of pressure pain along the jaw line and breast bone. I live alone with my 89 year old husband for whom I must help perform many activities of daily living. Any advice regarding a different type of head and/or neck support would be greatly appreciated. (I am an American citizen residing in the UK as the spouse of a British citizen.)  Doctor: IIN Britain, it is easier to consult an orthotics expert and an orthopedic doctor in a hospital. Four post collar is designed for your purpose which has adjustable screws and may be obtained from rehabilitation centers or prescribed from reality centers in UK. Your GP should be able to guide you better and refer you to an orthotic/orthopedic specialist thanks

I read and understand your concern. I am Chat Doctor answering your concern. Yes it can transmit to other family members if you are not completely treated. Wearing a mask can prevent infection transmission to other members via respiratory tract. In my opinion you should test yourself for the TB test. If you are free from the TB there is no need to worry. But if you are currently infected with TB than you should take complete treatment so other family members won't infect with it. Your wife must be having good immunity against the TB that is why she won't infected until now. Your baby will have same immunity as her mother is having, so you can allay the fear that your baby will be infected with it. You can have high protein and carboy Chat Doctor.  Avoid single binge-eating, instead you can have small frequent diet. Daily exercise, meditation and healthy living can keep you away from the all the medication.

Patient: HI I have a low white blood cell count and a high LDL cholestrol reading. The cholestrol has risen since Sept.even though my weight hasnt changed and I eat a very healthy diet. My problem is lack of sleep due to night sweats - and I mean real lack of sleep for 2 years.I know this can affect the white cells but would it affect the cholestrol? Thanks Glenda  Doctor: Hi Glenda, Welcome to Chat Doctor. Although sleep deprivation and high lipid levels can coexist in an individual, whether there is any causal relationship between the two is unclear. It can be expected that sleep deprivation causes sympathetic nervous activation that in turn can cause metabolic disturbances such as increase in blood levels of free fatty acids. However, to arrive at this conclusion more research needs to be done. However, I will advise that you consult your physician for your sleep deprivation as it can not only affect your metabolism but also other physiological systems in your body particular cardiovascular. Hope this helps.

Patient: I have a purple blotch that has appeared above my front teeth. It stretches across about three teeth. Im not sure how old it is since I rarely inspect my gums. I take care of my teeth relatively well, eat well, and do not smoke or chew, but I do not use mouth wash everyday. I have never gotten one of these markings before. Im an eighteen year old Caucasian female. Is it something I should have checked out?  Doctor: Hi. Welcome to Chat Doctor . I have gone through your query and can understand your concern. As per your complaint a purple blotch over gums on teeth can be a bruise caused by some injury to the gums and toothbrush bristles can be one of the most common cause of injury to the gums, or it can be due to some hard food like chips that can cause injury to the gums and rupture of small blood vessels can cause blood accumulation below the soft tissues leading to formations of red to purple bruises. As it is not painful there and is localized to only front three teeth you need not worry as gradually it will resolve on its own. In case if it spreads or there is pain in the area you should consult a dentist to get ruled out for infection in the gums or teeth. As of now there is nothing to worry as nothing seems serious. Hope this information helps. Thanks and regards. Chat Doctor. .

Patient: I have a friend, Who had kidney stones and right now cathetere is attached from her back side. But the problem is that her tube blocks bcz of sticky fluid and some times small stones. Sometimes she had sticky urine . Although she is under doctor guidance, but still wants to know, fhow sticky fluid coming from tube attached to kidney and what cure can be for that. She will soon have a open surgery to remove stones as all the other methods not worked.Pls help us in this regard. thanks.Dinesh,New Delhi,India  Doctor: Hi, more details are required. I think your friend had a blocked kidney tube due to stones and so a tube has been put into her kidney from the flank to Chat Doctor.  This is done to reverse the kidney swelling and prevent further kidney damage due to blocked kidney tube. It is also done in case the urine in kidney is infected or pus-like (hydronephrosis or infected IN). If tube gets blocked, check that it is not getting twisted or kinked, it is not getting compressed while lying down. If still gets blocked, probably changing to a larger size tube will help. Her urologist will be the best person to help. Good luck.

Patient: I have dark patches occuring on my face.  it started with slight marks on the cheeks which increased in size and now the mark also came on forehead.  doctor diagnosed it as melasma and prescribed Melalite-XL cream for 6 weeks and later reducing it with melalong.  There has been no improvement in the marks though.  I tried using Eumosome - m on the marks and i saw visible difference with the marks getting lighter.  I feel its not melasma.  Can you advise your diagnosis please.  Thanks a ton.  Doctor: Dear Pam, Welcome to Chat Doctor. After reading your problem the most common possibility appears to be Plasma only. I think you are a young female of age between 20-30. Now there could be second possibility of Post Inflammatory Hyperpigmentation(appearing after any skin problem). But as per your question it does not appear that any rash or something occurred on your face. Now for Plasma, it is a condition of hyperpigmentation occurring mainly over cheeks and sometimes on forehead too in superficial or deeper pigmentation.  It is considered to be a hormonal problem due to female hormones. Though it can occur frequently in men too. Now that you were prescribed with Melalite-XL cream for 6 weeks and later with Mel along. Both of these contains HY Chat Doctor.  The deeper pigmentation does not respond to this, which is the reason of no improvement in the marks. Response to Eurozone is variable thing, as is a type of topical STEROID- and every skin condition responds well in the beginning, but is a double-edged sword-giving benefit in beginning but later making dependency and innumerable side effects. So Kindly stop using that if you are not using for long term or slowly taper it off. You can ask your doctor for best and safest possible therapy for you which can be used for a longer period of time. Hope to HAE justified with your problem and query, With best of wishes for healthy glowing skin,
Patient: I ve been to see a doctor about my left hand middle finger knuckle, but she isnt sure whats wrong.It started with a tiny bump just under the main joint which itched quite a bit. It s now turned into a massive swelling which is so painful and immensely red. The skin is all bumpy. I haven t been into contact with anything unusual that may have caused an allergy . It s strange that it s only on the one finger and hasn t spread. My doctor has given me anti histamines, antibiotics and pain killers. The pain is gone but the swelling hasn t gone down. It s been 3 days now.  Doctor: Hi dear you're having painful itchy swelling on you one finger main inter challenging joint. Dear this could be due to infection of the skin over the interphalangeal joint. Since space under this skin is very less it is usually very painful. Your doctor has rightly treated you with antibiotics and painkiller, dont worry the swelling will subsides in a week time, you continue with treatment for a week time

These are small, local, involuntary muscle contraction and relaxation visible under the skin arising from the spontaneous discharge of a bundle of skeletal muscle fibers. You might consult your doctor who can order 1. A few blood tests including thyroid function tests, 2. Serum electrolytes including Serum calcium and potassium levels. 3. Serum B12 levels In case the above tests are normal further testing can be done including - nerve conduction studies, Electromyography, etc. These tests might help to diagnose any underlying neurological issues. I do hope that you have found something helpful, and I will be glad to answer any further query. Take care

PERNICIOUS ANEMIA - it's an anemia which occurs due to deficiency of "INTRINSIC FACTOR" - which is kind of chemical released by stomach, which in turn increases the absorption of vitamin B12. B12 plays very important role in process of formation of normal size and shape of RED BLOOD cell. In pernicious anemia the cell size increases due to lack of vitamin B12, which is why this kind on anemia is known as "LARGE-red blood cell anemia" (megaloblastic anemia). 1) As far as the treatment is concern replacement of the store of B12 can be done rapidly by VITAMIN B12 INJECTION which you already have taken. 2) A number of studies have shown long-term vitamin replacement treatment may be maintained with high-dose oral B12 supplements, since sufficient B12 is absorbed from these by a normal intestine, even without any intrinsic factor. So to answer your question, YES, you will be able to take "VITAMIN B12 TABLETS" once your stored B12 level comes to normal, and you need to replace the loss/ used B12 by high dose B12 ORAL TABLETS. HOPE IT HELPS.

Patient: ive recently noticed that when seeing an body injury or blood or things that look very severe make me breathe heavier, I get a full body heat flash and start to sweat but its not really hot but it feels like my body is on fire. It has lasted up to seven minutes before but then after I stop seeing or thinking about it Im fine.  One time I was having one of these heat flash things and I stood up and walked to try to get rid of it but it only felt like I was being pushed down and my body just some how sat down and layed itself down. When my head touched the ground I did not even realize I was laying down and I stood back up and my body cooled down and I felt normal.                       Some symptoms of these are:I start to breath heavyMy eyes get a little blurryI feel like I weigh a ton when I stand upand I feel pressure below the cerebellum on the back of my neck and in my heart.Its something that Ive never experienced before and its okay once it is over.Im a 14 year old boy  if that helps. Could this be fainting?  Doctor: The medical term for this is vasovagal syncope (also called neurocardiogenic syncope). This is essentially your mind reacting to something that it does not like and causing your body to experience these symptoms.
Patient: I am 38 male and have history of kidney stones in past.  In the last week I have been seeing in my urine long reddish stringy tissue type in my urine.  Saw my Dr and he just did blood and urine test.  He said to wait n see if its new stones trying to pass.  Does this sound right? Im just concerned and paranoid.

Patient: Im 8 months pregnant and my husband is not with me so in order to pleasure myself i masturbate. i lie on my stamach and "hump" a pillow or stuffed animal beacuse this seems the only way for me to get an orgasm. yet for some reason after im finished, the my stomach feels a little sore and tight. am i at all hurting the baby?  Doctor: Hallow Dear, During masturbation, all the muscles contract the same way they are contracting during intercourse; in fact many times they contract more forcefully. Due to the contractions of the abdominal muscles, you are getting the tightness and soreness in the abdomen. This should not cause any problem to your baby. I would request you to be rather gentle during masturbation. Instead of stimulating whole vulva and perineum, if you concentrate and restrict only to clitoral and labia minor stimulation, you may be successful in limiting vigorous movements of the whole body, particularly abdomen during masturbation. I would advise you to avoid pillow or stuffed animal as a toy for masturbation since their cleanliness cannot be guaranteed. You should not take any chance of introducing any infection in and around vagina. It may prove to be risky for your pregnancy. A clean washed hand or fingers can serve the purpose. Please do not use any latex rubber (condom or gloves are made of it) since its touch to the urinary opening (which is just below the clitoris) causes inflammation of urinary passage. I hope this helps you. The take home message is being gentle; be clean.
Patient: My mother had a break out of moles then later we found she had lung cancer. Her dermatologist called it Lestat-teslar??" I was named by a couple of French doctors who discovered the link between cancer in the body and this resultant "rash" of moles. What is the name? I noticed a similar pattern on my neck this morning.  Doctor: Hi. The sign you have mentioned is called Leser-Trelat sign. It is the explosive eruption of multiple seborrhea keratitis. It looks like pigmented skin lesions with an inflammatory base. Furthermore, it has been linked to an internal malignancy as a paraneoplastic syn Chat Doctor.  Seborrhea keratitis can also occur in individuals without malignancy and is common in elderly. A history, physical examination and then relevant investigations to rule out an internal malignancy is required. The sign is linked with adenocarcinoma of stomach & colon, squamous cell carcinoma, lymphoma and leukemia in decreasing order of frequency. I would suggest that you see a doctor and discuss it with him/her. If you have any further queries I will be more than happy to answer. Thank you for choosing Chat Doctor.
Patient: Dear sir, I have been taking peel treatment for my pimples and afrer 2nd seating mybskin was seemed to be lightly red and burnt. Is it normal?? Or i have got side effect of peel?.if this is side effect upto how many days it will last.? Wheb my skin become normal like before? Pls help me  Doctor: Hello, Thank you for posting on Chat Doctor. Chemical peeling is a simple procedure which causes controlled burning of skin leading to exfoliation superficial skin layers, decreases acne and pigmentation and gives you a rejuvenated skin. Usually post peel, redness and crusting is common and usually moisturizer and sunscreen is enough to take care the post procedure sequela. Sometimes, chemical peels may cause excessive redness/crusting due to deeper penetration of peel, but It's difficult to rule out without proper clinical examination or pictures. Anyway, start applying a cream containing demonize (Disown cream) twice a day gently over red/irritated skin followed by good quality moisturizer like Detail DAM. Always make sure you use your sunscreen before going out in sun and repeat application after every 3 hours and use proper clothing to cover face. Avoid pricking/scratching/peeling of skin. Use gentle cleanser like Detail cleanser for sensitive skin for regular face wash. Take some antihistamines like Exocet if excessive itching is there. Hope this will take care of your query, Thank you Chat Doctor.
Patient: Doctor, I underwent Angio 20 days back. i have started walking for 30 minutes for the last 8 days. I am feelimg comfortable.I got angioplasty done because it was located in angiography. I was admitted for breathlessness and all my tests( Blood, urine, Echo, stress ETC.)were normal.  Doctor: Your information is a bit spartan. If by uncomfortable, you mean your leg, that will usually resolve on its own, but your doctor should know. If you are referring to chest discomfort or breathlessness, the tests should be reassuring. You should continue activity recommended by your doctor and discuss alternate sources of symptoms like your esophagus (reflux) or asthma like symptoms.
Patient: HI. I have panhypopifuitarism & was recently prescribed Amlodopine 5mg & Indapamide 2.5mg to reduce blood pressure. My blood pressure is better but I am getting dreadful muscle & joint pain, in my arms & legs...esp calves. Am also v tired & brain fogged...and finding I wake several times during thd night. Could these drugs be causing my pain?  Doctor: Hi, thank-you for providing the brief history of you. As to know that what is panhypopituitarism is the below-mentioned will help you understand. BackgroundThe pituitary gland is called the master endocrine gland of the body because it controls the function of other endocrine organs. The anterior pituitary produces the hormones' thyrotropin (thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH]), corticotropin (a Chat Doctor.  The anterior pituitary is controlled by specific hypothalamic-releasing hormones. The posterior pituitary produces desmopressin (antidiuretic hormone [ADH]) and oxytocin. Panhypopituitarism is a condition of inadequate or absent production of the anterior pituitary hormones. It is frequently the result of other problems that affect the pituitary gland and either reduce or destroy its function or interfere with hypothalami secretion of the varying pituitary-releasing hormones. Panhypopituitarism can be the end result of various clinical scenarios. The signs and symptoms are diverse. Since the pituitary gland is the main of all, any abnormality in that can lead to various issues including the growth hormone. Consulting a physician can help further into the depth of the situation. Also, fatigue is common due to disturbed metabolism and may lead to muscle & joint aches and pains. Undergoing physical therapy will help improve the metabolism & immune system. Regards Jay In

Patient: hello I had three teeth pulled around 11 am yesterday and I woke up this morning with swollen lip, and jaw. underneath my chin is also swollen. no one can understand when I talk and I have difficulty drinking and eating. I dont want t drink with a straw because I dont want dry socket. what should I do?  Doctor: Hi. Welcome to Chat Doctor . I have gone through your query and can understand your concerns. As per your complaint swelling in jaw, lip and the area underneath the chin after extraction of teeth can occur most probably due to allergic reaction to either the local anesthesia injection or can be due to allergic reaction to any medication. In case if it is due to anesthesia then it will subside in 2 to 3 days as the effect of anesthesia will wean off. In case if still it does not improve consult your treating dentist and get evaluated. As of now do cold compresses over the swollen areas. You can take antihistamines like Ben Chat Doctor. . In case of excessive swelling due to inflammation steroid injection can be taken for faster resolution of swelling. Hope this information helps. Thanks and regards.

The ulcers in the mouth could be because of authors dermatitis that occurs most often secondary to stress.

If it is a traumatic ulcer or herpetic ulcer, you can take topical anesthetic and analgesics like Anabel gel. Apply 3-4 times daily before food.

Do saline gargling. If the lesion does not heal in 5-7 days then consult an oral physician and get it examined. I hope my answer will help you, take care.

Patient: Hi, my uncle has diagnosed with periampullary duodenum adenocarcinoma as per investigation. And he is taking chemotherapy. I read on most of the sites chemotherapy shortens the life. I don t know what is the stage, but before 3 years he had gone a surgery in which certain obstruction has been noticed. But before two months , a pertaining fever, vomiting occured, doctor suggested to go chemotherapy according to biopsy report. My question is , they will be all right after chemotherapy or have to take more care or prepare ourselves??? Thanks...  Doctor: Hi. This needs more details. First diagnosed case of perampullary carcinoma needs surgery and removal of part of duodenum, part of pancreas with gall bladder. Has this surgery been done is the question? If this surgery is done, only solution is chemotherapy. Even after chemotherapy, he needs close follow up to look if the cancer has spread somewhere else like liver etc. If it has spread it need further surgeries based on site and accessibility for the surgeon. Definitely chemotherapy has side effects. But we need to weigh risks over benefits. Since benefits are more we cannot avoid chemotherapy. Hope this information was helpful.

Patient: Mri impression: 1. Spondylolsis bilaterally at L5 with grade I anterolisthesiss, with left posterolateral protrusion and high-grade left formidable narrowing. Recommend correlation for left L5 symptoms. . Shallow right para central protrusion at the L4-5 level with mild disc bulging eccentric to the left, with minimal left foraminal narrowing. Recommend correlation for possible left L4 symptoms. 3. Mild disc bulging and facet anthropathy at other levels as detailed above. What does this mean?  Doctor: Hello, Thanks for your query. After going through your query I came to know that you want to know meaning of Spondylosis bilaterally at L5 with grade I anterolisthesis, with left anterolateral protrusion and high-grade left formidable narrowing. Spondylosis means degenerative disease in which osteophytes (protruding bone ends) are seen indicating aging. Grade I anterolisthesis means there is anterior shifting of spinal column in relation to lower vertebrae. Left anterolateral protrusion means disc is going backward and towards outer side. L5 root is pressed. Other tings are near normal. So there are changes of old age, coming out of disc between L5 and S1 vertebrae and there is anterior shifting of L5 vertebra along with whole spine as compared to S1. I do hope that you have found something helpful. If you have additional questions or follow-up queries then please do not hesitate in writing to us. I will be happy to answer your queries.
Patient: I have been on the Depo shot for over a year now... I usually only spot, but I ve been bleeding off and on for the last 2 weeks and now I m having severe cramping and back pain that feels like someone is stabbing me in my lower back. Is there a possibility that I could be pregnant or could it be the depo not agreeing with my body anymore?  Doctor: Hi, I think it can be a side effect of demo, or it can be due to vaginal infection also. Do a urine pregnancy test at home to clear the doubt.  But pregnancy is very unlikely. Get yourself examined by a gynecologist.  You can take some medicines like Tranexamic acid to stop the bleeding. You may need some antibiotics.  Hope I have answered your question.

Of course, it is quite misleading, but I will try to solve your problem. The causes of pain in the right lower abdomen are the urinary tract infection, stone in the ureter near the bladder, appendicitis, iliocaecal tuberculosis, or amoebic colitis usually accompanied by the bloody stools.  I usually prescribe to my patient with such symptoms niacin 500 mg B, D, furazolidone, metronidazole, fanatic acid, and dicyclomine HY Chat Doctor.

Patient: I am 30 weeks pregnant.....I have an external hemorrhoid that has been bothering me the last few days....It seems really big but I dont usually get them so not sure usual sizes but I noticed today that there are about 3 tiny black spots.......its also bleeding slightly but not from the black spots....what is this and what should I do?  Doctor: Hello You are having small bumps on the outer part of anal opening. You are 30 weeks pregnant. So within next 6-8 weeks you will deliver. Now according to your history having superior, middle and inferior veins hemorrhoids. In my opinion use NOVATE cream. Apply to clean area, up to 4 times a day ;may be used externally or inserted rectally using applicator. Since fetus part developed very well and this cream is mostly not for oral use, so will not develop any harm to fetus. At present, you are nearly on full term pregnancy, so can't take surgical treatment for hemorrhoids. In my opinion this will be useful for you. Good luck
Patient: I had salivary gland cancer and under went parotidectomy 2 yrs ago. A year after the surgery, I now suffer from Frey syndrome. Now I have intermittent eye twitch on the same side of the surgery. Is this a common complication after few tears after the surgery? Thank you.  Doctor: Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You have salivary gland cancer.  You have gone through parotidectomy.  Facial nerve lies in proximity to deep lobe of parotid gland.

Please inform her doctors and make arrangement for her to sleep on water bed to avoid more bed sores from happening. Since she is diabetic, there is possibility of the bedsore developing an aggressive infection. First medications are to be applied in the region of bedsore.

This will prevent sweat from accumulating and preventing new sore formation. Attempts are also to be made to lower her blood glucose. Diabetes causes infections to spread quickly to other areas and this must be prevented. Please check the bedsore wound every 6 hours and change surgical
Patient: I work with a developmentally disabled non-verbal participant at a day program with a stomach G-tube. On occasion during program hours we note copious amounts of clear sticky drainage coming from this site. This is not gastric content. At times it has occurred within a few days after a new tube has been put in. It seems to not happen as much with a foley type of tubing verses a standard G-tube with a disc bumper attached. I have checked the amount of fluid in the balloon and that has been okay. My question is it normal to see this type of drainage periodically ?  Doctor: Hi and welcome to Chat Doctor. Yes it is. This shouldn't concern you. These are mixed secretions of gastric and esophageal glands and saliva and its normal. The only important thing is that there is no obstruction, stenosis or infection of g-tube and around it. Also, there shouldn't be bloody or busy discharge. If you notice any of these, please consult surgeon who performed procedure. Regards

Patient: i have had yearly blood tests over the last few years, i am 45 years old, 1.90m and 83kg. the last 2 tests revealed a slight drop in hemaglobin levels from 13.0 to 12.0, iron levels are within the norm. there is a history of cancer on the female side of my family and heart disease on the male side. i myself suffer from periodic insomnia. what could be the cause of this drop?  Doctor: Hi, Hemoglobin will vary with age and sex. The nutrition will play the biggest role. The common nutrients involved are it B 12, folic acid and iron. If your iron is normal, other nutrients might be low. You can get a B12 assay or folic acid assay done. You can get red cell indices to identify the type of anemia. 12g% is still normal. If you can specify the type of cancer, I can help you with identifying symptoms and investigations necessary. Any further queries, happy to help again.

Earlier, he took more sweets and we are based at Chennai India, where now the climate is also cold.  Doctor: HI, Having cough during the night and not having other symptoms such as high temperature suggests a Castro esophageal reflux or a sensitization (allergy) from house dust mites.

Patient: hi dr, my husband has several gall stones ranging 12mm and liver is in normal size, pancreas and major abdominal vessels, spleen and both kidneys appear unremarkable. doctor is saying gall bladder has to be removed as soon as possible.. Just wondering is there any other alternative to flush out the stones naturally???  Doctor: HI, and thank you for asking us on Chat Doctor! I read carefully the concerns and your husbands medical history. There are different opinions between doctors about how to be treated gallbladder stones. If they don't cause any problem, might not be necessary to be removed, and they can be followed by ultrasound regularly. But if they cause symptoms like pain, fever, vomits etc., which indicate for gallbladder infection, than the best choice is the surgery for removing the stones or the gallbladder too. I suggest you to do routine check-up to your treating doctor. Best regards Chat Doctor.
Patient: Hi, I live in Manitoba, Canada, where currently there have been a few reported cases of the Measles. My son is 14 months old and tonight I noticed a measles-like rash on his trunk. He may have had a low grade fever a earlier this week but I never checked him since he was sweaty at times but playing happily and otherwise fine. He is getting his molars and has had his fingers in his mouth a lot, which I assumed was due to teething discomfort. Currently, he has no fever. Apparently, when I was a child, I had the measles with no fever or symptoms other than the rash. Is it possible that my son has the measles in the same way that I did as a child? What do you recommend I do?  Doctor: Hi! I read carefully your query. The typical case of measles actually starts with a fever, runny nose, hacking cough, and red eyes. After two to four days of these symptoms, the patient may develop spots within the mouth called Kopecks spots. These spots look like little grains of white sand surrounded by a red ring and are usually found inside the cheek toward the back of the mouth (opposite the first and second upper molars). The skin rash (also known as an exanthem or anthem) appears three to five days after the onset of the initial symptoms (fever, cough, runny nose, and red eyes). The rash is a flat to slightly raised (maculopapular) red rash that usually last five to six days. It begins at the hairline and then progresses to the face and upper neck. Over the next two to three days, the rash progresses downward to cover the entire body, including the hands and feet. The rash has mostly distinct lesions, but some may overlap (become confluent). Initially, these lesions will turn white when you press on them (blanch). After three to four days, they no longer will blanch. As the rash begins to fade, there will often be a fine flaking of the skin (defamation). The rash fades in the same order that it appears. The fever that occurs with measles is called a stepwise fever. The patient starts with a mild fever that progressively gets higher. Fevers often reach temperatures greater than 103 F (39.4)If you notice these symptoms to your son you should seek medical attention. Hope it was helpful to you. Wish a good health to your son.

Patient: I am suffering from pain in the legs and sometimes in hands. When I start walking I get heaviness in the head. I have done my MRI brain Scan plain which is normal. My protein is high 1.8. I have done my rheumatic arthritis test which is normal my b12 is around 1052. My doctor has suggested evion tab  Doctor: Hi, Without an exam, I can only give general information, Lets start with atypical angina would be heaviness in the bottom part of the head. That is pretty common! Typical in the textbooks is heaviness or dull pain in the neck with exercise with shortness of breath. That would be a serious symptom that could imply the risk of a heart attack in the immediate future. Pain in the legs, however, is pretty much never heart. And overall poor exercise ability would cause all of this. So, the treatment is more exercise BUT, there would have to be an evaluation and likely a stress test before it would be safe to recommend. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.
Patient: Yesterday i was in the car and started to not feel well. I get car sick sometimes so i figured it was just that. But it kept getting worse. It was just pain that i couldnt control. I stopped at a gas station thinking if i peed it would help. When i got out of the van i was really weak and tripped over myself walking in and was very dizzy. Once i got inside i rushed to the counter and asked where the bathrooms were. Once i got in there, i stubbled into the stall and everything was still blurry. I couldnt find the lock on the door and started rubbing my hand on the door searching for it. I finally found it, sat on the toilet and just blacked out. I was sweating the whole time and got so hot in the bathroom i took my shirt off. I had another episode tonight but not as severe. I was out eating pizza and was looking at my phone and all of a sudden i just blacked out and dont even know what happened. Id just like to know whats going on.  Doctor: Hi, Thanks for writing in. Blurring, dizziness with syncope is an emergency situation and can be due to many reasons. It might happen due to decreased blood flow from heart to brain. When it happens, the blood flowing through the vessels from heart to brain might have a reduced flow. These are by the carotid and vertebral arteries on either sides. You might require a brain scan and other investigations to study the flow of blood to the brain. There are also many other causes of dizziness within the brain like a small stroke like episode or any infection. Please get yourself consulted by a doctor to evaluate any conditions like severe flu or infections of the ear and brain that might have caused your problems. Dizziness cal also occur due to problems in the inner ear and balance mechanism of the body. The balance mechanism in humans is partly due to the functioning of small hair cells in the inner ear. An infection in ear called laryngitis can also cause sudden symptoms.
Patient: For the past month, I have had intermittent abdominal pain (not centered on any one location.) It periodically gets better or worse with no real pattern.  I have also had yellow stool for much of this time (with four or five days of normal stool during which the pain vanishes or reduces). I have done an ultrasound, urine test, and blood tests, and the doctor said my gallbladder, liver, and pancreas look normal and tested normal. The only things unusual was I have a bit of a fatty liver and a slightly elevated white cell count in my blood. The pain is minor, an inconvenience more then really painful, and it appears most commonly in my upper right abdomen, but can appear in any location, usually only one place at a time.  Doctor: HI. Thanks for your query and an elucidated history. This looks to be due to chronic intestinal infection RIBS- irritable bowel syn Chat Doctor.  Since WBC is high, it is better to take a course of an antibiotic and metronidazole, who knows it is amoebic hepatitis as it appears the same on ultrasonography. The most important test of stool is not done till now-get this done, helps a proper diagnosis sometimes. Review ultrasonography after the 7-day course.
Patient: Hi, my father has lfet side paralysis , in MRI report it is said, Small Ischemic foci in deep periventicular white matter , he unable to walk, he usually walks with the help of other person, he is 64 year old with dibetic problem, taking 1mg glimpride teblet in the morning and evening, with blood thinner tablets. please suggest some effective medicine...  Doctor: Hi, Treatment of stroke and chances of recovery depends on the size of stroke and the duration of complaints.  Presuming you meant the small ischemic loci is on the right cerebral hemisphere, the affected brain is not huge and prognosis is good. If his complaints are recent one and my presumption is right, then he should be able to recover easily. The medications given to him are appropriate, and he needs to continue with it religiously. In addition, the most important aspect is to start and continue effective physiotherapy with the help of an experienced physiotherapist. This is the most crucial element to make your father recover from the paralysis and get back to his normal activity.  So if you haven't started the physio yet, discuss with your neurologist and start it at the earliest. He should improve very soon with it. Hope this helps. Regards

Hy Chat Doctor. 5 mg/day) is used to treat mild hypertension, and it seems your BP is well controlled with this dose. HCTZ is unlikely to cause liver damage, however patients with severe liver disease or cirrhosis are very susceptible to thiazide-induced electrolyte disturbances (hypokalemic hypochloremic alkalosis) which can cause hepatic coma. Hemochromatosis is a hereditary disorder in which excess of iron is stored in the tissues of major organs, especially liver, pancreas, heart and testes. Serum ferritin measures the amount of iron stored in the body. For adults, the ideal range is 50-150 NG/ml. Over a period of years, the stored iron can severely damage many organs, leading to organ failure and chronic diseases such as cirrhosis, diabetes and heart failure. Regular removal of blood (phlebotomy) can be done every 8 weeks. Serum ferritin

Patient: HiIm a stressed mom. My 4 yr old son  has been vomitting, abdominal pain. Diarrhea has stopped. Took him to doctor, he says that its my sons appendix. My husband is not believing the doctor because he thinks my son caught a bug from him the previous night. Help help  Doctor: Hello. I just read through your question. Anytime a doctor encounters a patient with vomiting and abdominal pain, the diagnosis of appendicitis must be considered. The typical course would be a generalized abdominal pain that, over time, becomes most intense on the lower right side. From the time the symptoms begin until the time the appendix ruptures is approximately 36-48 hours. So it is important to make the diagnosis early. If symptoms have lasted longer than this, or the pain has not become most intense on the lower right side, appendicitis is unlikely, and the most common diagnosis is a bug, as your husband stated.

Patient: I have swollen glands in my neck that I have had since mid August, I have in the last two weeks been having right sided chest pains and very itchy skin in this area, also some awful night sweats and having lots of hot flushes where my face becomes bright red, any ideas?  Doctor: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. In my opinion, we should rule out tuberculosis in your case. You are having enlarged glands in neck. This must be enlarged cervical lymph nodes. Most common site for tubercular lymphadenitis is neck. You are also having chest pain with night sweats. Both these are also seen in tuberculosis. So better to get done 1. Ultrasound examination of neck. 2. Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) 3. Chest x-ray 4. Complete blood count with ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate). If these reports are suggestive of tuberculosis then you have to take anti-tubercular Chat Doctor.  Don't worry, with appropriate treatment, you will be alright. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.
Patient: I am 50 years old, female & have external hemorrhoids. I have been using Faktu ointment the past weeks & has expereinced a burning sensation in the anal area for about 5 hours after defecation.  Is there Any natural medication fror hemorrhoids?  Should I stop using Faktu?  Doctor: Hi there. Thanks for writing in. A good diet the best treatment for hemorrhoids. A diet rich in high-fiber foods and low in processed foods is essential. Increasing fluid intake to six to eight 250ml glasses a day also is important. Warm site baths are also helpful: Sit in about three inches of warm water for 15 minutes, several times a day, especially after a bowel movement. This helps reduce the swelling in the area and relaxes spasm of the sphincter muscle. Include a lot of bananas, fruits, salads, green leafy vegetables. Raisins soaked in water will also help in good bowel movements. The main aim is to prevent constipation, which is the main culprit for worsening of hemorrhoids. Hope my answer was helpful to you.

Actually there is possibility of high blood pressure & toxemia in following pregnancy BUT it can be successfully prevented by careful medical check-ups & investigations for maintaining normal blood pressure, normal urine, blood parameters in pregnancy./ taking blood pressure medicines regularly & keeping it in normal limits throughout the pregnancy/ follow ideal lifestyle in pregnancy.  So you can plan for next pregnancy with a normal blood pressure, good health, good HBO before getting conceived.  Wish you all the best.  Thanks.
Patient: my child is 10 months old and is gagging a lot, not necessarily while he is eating just while he is playing. His fingers are not in his mouth. It will happen all of sudden, he will gag and then gag to the point when he looks like he is going to puke, but he doesnt.  Doctor: Hello, Symptoms which you describe suggestive of breath holding spells or chaotic spells, in which baby turn bluish all of a sudden while crying, also in normal condition. You need to do some investigation as echocardiography, complete blood count (CBC) for hemoglobin levels. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.
Patient: I am looking into a hysterectomy and the OB doctor I saw yesterday seems to be pushing ablation vs. hysterectomy even though I have tried multiple treatments for my issues (heavy uncomfortable periods as many as 3 per month, headaches, fibroids, cramping etc..) and appears to be trying to sway my decision.  He has also stated that due to 4 previous c-sections I am not a candidate for either vaginal or laproscopic surgery.  I saw him for my annual screening due to my other doctor being on vacation.  Do you have any thoughts on a mandatory abdominal surgery after c-sections?  Doctor: Hallow Dear, At the outset, let me assure you that cesarean section has nothing to do with your heavy uncomfortable periods and fibroid. In fact, your heavy painful periods are due to fibroid uterus. Had it been only heavy menstruation, thermal ablation would have helped you. Thermal ablation is destroying the lining of the uterus (endometrium) by very hot fluid. It is the endometrium of the uterus which gets thrown out as menstrual discharge. Hence, once the endometrium is destroyed, there is no menstruation, and no heavy bleeding. However, you have fibroid uterus. This fibroid(s) will remain in the uterine cavity though your menstruation has been stopped by thermal ablation. This fibroid can undergo atrophy after menopause, however, remains as a vulnerable tissue for any type of degeneration including cancer. I would advise you to go for hysterectomy and not thermal ablation. Of course, it is advisable to undergo hysteromicroscopically directed biopsy of the endometrium to find out the status of the endometrium before hysterectomy. In about 30% of cases, cancer of endometrium is known to coexist with fibroid since both these conditions are result of high estrogen condition. I hope this helps you.

Patient: I m a 49 y/o white female. I started with MCD and was placed on a steroid regimen. I took 80mg a day for almost 3 years. I am now at ESRD and have dialysis three times a week. About a year after becoming diagnosed with hinder disease I started suffering from debilitating abdominal pain primarily RLQ. I have had a TAH with BSO, chole, and appy. We have had numerous endoscopes and colonoscopies. All normal. I m now having diffuse pain through the abdomen radiating it my back. I was finally allowed to have a CT with contrast and it showed pancreatic atrophy. I also have fibromyalgia, osteoporosis, hyper parathyroidism. The pain have increased exponentially over the last three years. What are my options. I m going to see my primary care physician next week. Also I am not showing signs of DM but haven t had an a1c yetd  Doctor: The symptoms are related to pancreatic disease and due to fibrosis in the region with trapping of nerve or pressure on the fine nerve bundles you could consult a rheumatologist and once the primary disease is treated all symptoms will be out!all the best!

Patient: I have been diagnosed with peptostreptococcus infection. The wound is on my upper thigh. I have had steroid shots in my back, and each time, after a few weeks, I have broke out. The doctor lanced the wounds, and had them tested. Could the shots in my back be the issue? Thank you  Doctor: Hello, It is unrelated to a steroid shot.

Patient: My father in law was tested today and advised that his blood proton levels were still to low and he should remain on Coumadin. He has been on Coumadin for about a week and a half to get his clotting controlled in order to allow him to have a prostate biopsy.  Doctor: Hi, I had gone through your question and understand your concerns. Well, I am not sure if you understood your doctor good. Blood proteins are usually not related to Coumadin therapy. And Coumadin is used for prevention of deep vein thrombosis. Blood proteins are something else and you should specify what kind of proteins are but talking about. If you mean tumor marker PSA then it will not reduce without urologic intervention, If you mean prothrombin time then he should titrate Coumadin dosage till adequate prothrombin time is established. Hope this answers your question. If you have additional questions or follow-up questions then please do not hesitate in writing to us. I will be happy to answer your questions. Wishing you good health.

Patient: Dr, MD Krueger, I dont fit in logical grafics of coloncancer. Eating very well, lots of fruits, veges, lots combination of whole fiber grains, soy, miso. I dont smoke, i am very lean, did lots of sport and being very creative.(1.82m for 68 kg in normal condition)2 years ago I became 58 and did a colonoscopy, some values of iron were very low and this was an serious indication. A severe operation, removal of the large intestine, gallbladder and lots of tissue of peritonium occured begin 2010.2009 my beloved wife died of braintumor in 5 months.One year i followed chemo, but theire was no results. I stopped 5 month to look for other opportunities , but started again some month ago with a combination chemo/anti-bodies. I had waterretention round my waist (5 l), they tapped it off but it didnt return till now. I have more energy and it seems that for the first time some results are visible. I dont know the right scientic name, but the oncologe told me about mucus-related-cancer in the peritonium who is spread around. Is theire some food that is harmfull for such a condition ?To stay in condition i do Tai-chi and Qi-gong. Running is over now.  Doctor: Hi.

The main modality of treatment is removal of all covering inside your abdomen called peritonectomy and intraperitoneal chemotherapy.food intake doe snot affect the progress of the disease once cancer has established.you can avoid red meat and high cholesterol foods at least for now...

Doctor: Hallow Dear Tabitha, You seem to be quite stressed out with the apprehension of the outcome of this probable pregnancy. Tabitha, If you had your menses on 2 Oct., it is barely 9-10 weeks now. At such an early phase of pregnancy, the abdomen does not bulge out. The womb is still within the bones of the waist and hence cannot be felt or seen.  However, your breast symptoms, frequent urination and nausea & vomiting may appear at this stage of pregnancy. Still, only on these symptoms, the pregnancy can be suspected but not diagnosed. Please get your urine pregnancy test done. It will be definitely decisive at this stage. If you go for ultrasonography, it will give direct visual evidence of your pregnancy and moreover will give information of the size of the sac also. Do not be under the stress due to previous wasted pregnancy.  Ultrasonography will give you relevant information. Wish you the best.

Patient: Hi I recently had a ruptured cerebral aneurysm and had a coiling proceedure done. They did a spinal tap to be able to find traces of blood in my fluid. Since the spinal tap I have had lower back pain everyday and in a couple of cases my legs have almost given out on me. The spinal tap was done about 3 weeks ago now. Should I be worried about this. I have researched the internet and have found that other people have experienced this as well.  Doctor: Hello. Thanks for writing to us. The spinal tap is sometimes associated with a persistent pain in the legs due to the irritation of the nerve roots at the level of spinal cord. This is a self limiting symptom and is likely to improve in next 2-3 weeks. Taking methylcobalamin supplements will help. I hope this information has been both informative and helpful for you. You can consult me again directly through my profile URL http://bit.ly/ Chat Doctor.
Patient: I am a 78-year-old female who broke my toe next to big toe when I was age 8 or so. It healed in a bent position like a hammertoe. Now I am having a difficult time with swollen ankles and inflammed fat pad on both of my feet. I weigh 138 lbs. and am 5 1 . I have this foot pain flare up several times a year. I usually ice and take ibuprofen and in three or four days it settles down, but now for the past few months my feet have been very sore and the other day were so painful, I could not step. I have been icing for the past few days and feel someone better but fat pad still red and looks swollen. Could you please give me an idea of what I am dealing with. Thank you so much.  Doctor: Hi, thank you for providing the brief history of you. A thorough neuromuscular assessment is needed. As mentioned by you the brief history there are 3 possibilities coming in my mind for which a thorough neuromuscular assessment is needed. The first is a vascular insufficiency, the second is the increased uric acid levels and the third is the neuropathic pain.to rule out the factors here - performing a urine test will help us determine is the pain and swelling is because of the increased uric acid levels and by medication and physical therapy the pain and recurrence can be avoided. For ruling out the vascular insufficiency the Doppler test for both the Lowe limbs will be performed post which is the test is positive - rest, Medication and physical therapy will be advised for better results. You need to use even stockings of lower limbs to ensure the venous return. For the neuropathic pain, your blood glucose levels and MRI of lumbar spine will be guided. Post which based on the possible positive test the treatment will be planned. As due to aging factor - there is even a possibility of lower cardiac output and slower venous return can lead to swelling of ankles. Understanding that the body needs mobility more at this age to allow the venous return to occur and improve the metabolism as well. After a thorough assessment the root cause can be found and post which the treatment will be planned to avoid the future recurrence. RegardsJay In Chat Doctor.
Patient: Hi, my gf and i were fooling around and i ejeculated, there was some sperm on my hand, around 5 minutes after that we started fooling around again and without thinking i i introduced my hand in her vagina, I think she was in a really fertile moment since it happened 13 days after her menstruation, how possible is it that she may be pregnant?  Doctor: HelloThanks for writing to us with your health concern. Generally, fingering cannot result in a pregnancy. Also, pre ejaculatory fluid can lead to pregnancy at times, however you have not mentioned if any penetrative vaginal sex occurred. Sperm cannot survive outside in the hostile environment for 5 minutes, according to me, the chances of a pregnancy resulting from the encounter described are next to nil. If there was no vaginal penetration, then pregnancy cannot occur. However, if you are very concerned, you can still ask her to take ECP (emergency contraceptive pill) as a precautionary measure. When taken within 120 hours of unprotected sex, it is more than 80 % effective in guarding against a pregnancy. The expected period can be advanced or postponed for almost a week, after taking the Echo there is no way to predict the next date of her period. To be on the safer side, if you think there was some chance of a pregnancy please take a pregnancy test 4 weeks after the episode occurred. All the betake care.

Patient: little red bump with a black spot in the center on the top of my baby toe. when i break it open and squeeze there is either/both clear fluid and blood. no pain with direct pressure, slight pain with pressure on the sides but i have been squeezing fluid out the last half hour. had it several months, havnt paid much attention to it. hasnt affected normal life in any way. what is it and should i do somehting about it?  Doctor: Hi, Dear Good Evening, and thanks for the query to Chat Doctor. Cause of the red lump on the top of my baby toe-I studied your query and understood your health concerns. In my opinion the red lump is mostly due to chronic infected boil-of the toe. It has not affected the normal life of the baby and is due the thickened chronic abscess wall of the toe boil. To avoid any further septic complications from it -I would advise you to consult an ER Surgeon ASAP. Hope this would help in planning treatment with you Doctor.

Patient: last week I went to my MD for some cortisone shots and you know they always check your vitals. When BP was taken, the first reading was 94/56 and the second time, approximately 15 minutes later was around 98/58. Since March, Ive lost 152 pounds due to a gastric Bypass. Im an cardio junke and weight train 5 days a week. Im now down to 178. Once in awhile when I get up from a seated position a get a little dizzy/light headed. Do I have a major issue here?Thanks Jeff  Doctor: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Your symptom of dizziness especially on getting up is due to hypotension only. Blood pressure values of 94/56mmhg, 98/58 MMH etc. are suggestive of hypotension. Since you had gastric bypass and lost 152 pounds, possibility of nutritional and electrolytes deficiency is more. Gastric bypass surgery causes poor absorption of nutrients and electrolytes. All these are normal to maintain blood pressure. So consult doctor and get done serum electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride). If deficiency then you will need supplements.  Chat Doctor.
Patient: Okay I will ask again.  Could not access with password the site.  I had my gallbladder out last Tuesday.  Scan showed it was infected with thickening of the wall.  Doctor said it was the worse infected gallbladder he had ever seen.  Said it was chronic.  Do they check the gallbladder after they remove it for cancer?  Could the infected gallbladder infected my liver or pancreatis?  Doctor: Hellenes, any resected gall bladder is sent to pathology for an examination and any cancer would have been reported. Unless the infected gall bladder ruptures, the infection cant spread to the liver or pancreas
Patient: Whenever I cough or bend over there s an excruciating pain in my head, always the exact same spot. Several years ago I had a scan after hearing all music off-key. A small pool of blood was found but the doctor felt my body would absorb it and treatment wasn t needed. The pain I m experiencing is in that exact same spot. No answers after an MRI, just had another today but this time with and without contrast. I fear again no one will find anything out of the ordinary. Can you suggest possibilities my neurologist can rule out?  Doctor: Hello ! Thank you for your question on Chat Doctor! Regarding your concern I would like to exclude primary stabbing headache, and an occipital neuralgia. I would like to know the location of the pain. If it is in the back of your head it may be occipital neuralgia. As you mention brain MRI is normal. So the main causes of secondary headaches have been excluded. The diagnosis of primary headache is clinical, and no other tests are needed to find out the type of headache. In both the headache types that I have mentioned above, treatment with Indomethacine twice daily is very helpful. If no results I would recommend Tokamak or Amitriptyline. Hope to have been helpful! Greetings!
Patient: I have a small marble sized lump to the left of the center of the back of my neck right below my hair line. Its on the left side, and when i push on it, i feel a sharp pain on the top right side of my head. I noticed it about a week ago. what could it be??  Doctor: Hi! This is a common complaint in our general OLD, and we come to a conclusive diagnosis only after a needle biopsy! Anyways, we find different possibilities as follows:1. A neurofibroma, considering sharp pain on the top right side my head; 40% cases2. An enlarged lymph node due to infection in the scalp, ear, throat, or Dan Chat Doctor.  30% case3. A sebaceous cyst 25% case4. Other benign tumors like lipoma 5% casesTherefore, the possibility is non-serious or benign but needs confirmation to relieve your tension; you need to see a physician for an examination and relevant management!regards,
Patient: I had an MRI yesterday of my lumbar. It states I have slight degenerative subcortical edema anteriorly-inferiorly at L1, L2 and L3. The marrow signal is otherwise unremarkable. It also states the conus terminates at the L1-2 and is unremarkable. There are a few small Tarlov cysts within the sacral canal. I was in a car accident 6 months ago and continue to have low back pressure/pain and right foot numbness and right hip pain when standing. What does all this mean?  Doctor: Hi! With history of trauma, It's possible to have secondary osteoarthritis development in low spine and edema may be causing pressure of nerve roots there...cysts are a finding with OA spine, nothing to worry...conservative treatment like lumbar sacral brace, physical therapy, anti-inflammatory medicines maybe required to abate symptoms. There are medicines to reduce edema also and back rest with physical therapy shall control the disease process. Consult a spine/orthopedics doctor for it Best wishesThank you Chat Doctor.

Patient: My almost 6 year old seems to ve getting a molar.  Can see the circular eruption.   When I brush his teeth, it sometimes bleeds from the middle of the circle.   Neither of my other children bled when getting molars.   Is this a normal part of teething?  Doctor: Hi. Thanks for the query. If there is bleeding from the gum of the erupting molar then it is probably due to inflammation of the gums around the erupting molar that can cause bleeding while brushing. This is because the inflamed tissue has abundance of premature blood vessels that gets ruptured when even slight injury is implicated that is even the toothbrush bristles. Do not worry as when the tooth will erupt completely the bleeding will subside on its own. For now, you can use a soft toothbrush to brush his teeth and make him do warm saline gargles. Keep the area clean and do not let food particles accumulate. He can also gargle with antiseptic mouthwash suitable for child Chat Doctor. . Hope this helps. Regards.

Patient: Hi Doctor, I have been concerned with a v small lump on my penis for at least 12 months now, I have been to my GUM clinic twice in this time. Both times they have said it is not a wart and that it is some kind of irritated gland or follicle. Is there a chance they have got this wrong or is it paranoia on my part?Many Thanks  Doctor: Hi. If the swelling is at the base of the penis it is most likely a sort f the follicle they have mentioned. Is it causing any problem ?IF it is at the shaft it still can be a blocked sweat gland. Leave it alone if there are no symptoms; it is there for 12 months you say... If you still have doubts show this to a surgeon for a proper diagnosis, and you can get it out by a small surgery.

The query is a bit ambiguous, but this is what I feel is the problem. I am sorry that your mother has been diagnosed with lung cancer with also spots in brain and that it is in stage 4.  She has been a pot smoker for forty years in her life. I am sorry, but stage 4 lung cancer has very poor outcome. The 5-year survival rates in an advanced stage are very less. She needs to quit using all forms of tobacco and pot too. Various chemotherapy options are available. They can be decided upon individual patient needs and benefits. I hope this helps you.

Patient: I grew up in Arizona and in 2001 I started coughing and was short of breath.  Found out I have asthma, am taking advair 100/50, do pretty well except in cold weather, I live in Tennessee now and the winters really hurt me.  Ok, started having chest pains upper back pain, somtimes really bad, somtimes its liveable. Could this be from my Asthma or somthing else in my lungs?  thanks  beverly  Doctor: HI, thanks for using Chat Doctor Asthma would not normally be associated with pain in the back. The pain may be related to another lung issue or something else entirely. Pain can be related to any structure in the area. This includes the skin (e.g. shingles), bones, muscles and other soft tissue and then underlying organs. It is possible that the pain is related to one of these structures. It would be best to visit your doctor for an assessment if it continues. I hope this helps

VITAMIN B12- SERUM = 147 (197-866) VITAMIN D (25 OH) TOTAL = 4.10 ng/ml. LFT : AST( SGOT )-SERUM/ PLASMA = 45 (5-40) ALT(SGOT)-SERUM/PLASMA = 77 (5-40) Colonoscopic Diagnosis: DISTAL ILEAL ULCERS .Examination done upto distal 10cm ileum.Multiple superficial to deep ulcers were present in distal ileum. Multiple Biopsies were taken For HPE.Rest of the colon shows normal mucosa. No polyps, strictures, growth, vascular malformationor any other lesion seen. (Rest tests shows normal study.) After one week treatment following tests were also carried out: CECT SCAN-Upper abdomen -Normal study. Hbsag = Non Reactive Anti HCV-IgG = 0.07 Index ( 1.00) After taking medicine for 15 days, i noticed abdominal pain and back pain upto neck in the evening. the day i took the medicine, i feel pain in the evening and when i stopped taking medicine, the pain is gone. doctor advised me following tests : small bowel anema = ( to be done) amylase = 74.00 U/L ( 13.00-53.00 ) lipase = 85 U/L ( 67..) tb quantiferon = (REPORT YET TO COME) mantoux test = (REPORT YET TO COME) Now i m not taking medicine and feels no pain. i,ve quitted drinking since last 15 days. now i request you to look into matter and advice is that abdominal pain occurs due to the medicine i took? Should i continue those medicines ? May be these medicines have not suited my body? med: meberverine, mesacol, rabcita dsr, folvite  Doctor: Hello there, Distal Ideal ulcers with raised ESR are suspicious for Intestinal Tuberculosis (TB). Looking at the tests prescribed for you, I think your doctor is already trying to rule out the presence or absence of TB. I think you can safely continue the current medications as I don't think they are the cause of your pain. If you don't mind I would like to know if you are you having any low grade fever, cough, weight loss? Have you noticed any swellings in your neck or armpits? Hope I have answered your query. Looking forward for further information from you. I will be available in case of any further queries. Get well soon.
Patient: i just had an echocardiogram done few days ago i have a left bundle branch block  i am about to be 24 years old. it showed i have a heart murmur and 2 leaky valves and thickening  doctor said it is nothing to worry about but my dad had to have surgery for leaky valves. the doctor said the murmur is leaky valves is it possible that the leaky valves means nothing and i can continue to excercise and live life as normal with no check ups?my chest is tight and feels like its is hard to breathe doctor said it is anxiety  Doctor: After being told that your heart is not normal, anxiety is completely normal. Many times that something does not appear to be normal, we cannot know what that will mean later. Minor valve leaks are sometimes tolerated for a lifetime. EKG findings also may be just something you should be aware of. A left bundle branch block is one of those things. Any time that someone wants an EKG from you, you should warn them that you already know that it is present. It also is of uncertain importance long term. However, it is a good idea to have someone listen to your heart and review overall importance to you every few years, just in case you change, or we learn something in the meantime.

Patient: Swollen calves ankles tightness in legs and a red blotchy rash no itching but warm in spots the rash proceeds up the legs into the inner thighs rash started yesterday and he had fever and sweats during the night. My hubby is 47. What could this be. He is not on meds. But he s been tired the past couple days and said today his legs hurt. Can an allergic reaction cause this  Doctor: Hi, it can be allergic, or it can be a vascular symptom. Until it is checked in person it is tough to mention allergic or vascular too? Only ankle tightness or notch sores or anything doesn't make any direction to follow. You can do one of the two things. First try doing some hot water fermentation and then little ankle toe movements. If the things gets better it will be good. If Not then you can meet a physician and take further advice for which test to do for what?

Patient: I went into a medical aid unit yesterday after suffering lower back issues (spasms) from simply bending over. This is not the first time it has happened, been a few years though, and it was about 16 hours before I was able to get a ride in. They injected me with a muscle relaxer (not sure what) then prescribed Diazepam 5 mg to take every 8 hours which I started at about 11 am yesterday and took as prescribed. I woke up this morning with a sore throat, thought it might just have been dry in the house (oil heater), it has not gone away, and I don t feel the meds are helping my back, they just make me sleepy. Not sure if I should go back to get meds changed?  Doctor: Muscle spasms of the back are often related to inflexible muscles related to the lower back complex (example tight hamstrings, trunk flexor muscles) along with a weak core and back muscle complex.Also, a poor HY Chat Doctor.
Patient: I have spinal stenosis and have had back surgery 3 years ago today. I have been pain free until last year and aching and pain in my right leg has gotten worse. The most pain is at night when I am in bed and I try to turn. I must stretch in am or I am in pain and can hardly walk. Why at night is the question?  Doctor: Hi, I think you should go for a physical therapy sessions for pain management and later strengthening the core and lower limbs as a whole. Now the question of why the pain comes more in the lying down position is due to the tightness of the hamstring muscle you have which pulls the spine into extension poison and that's where the nerve gets trapped and gives you an electric shock pain. Now why night? As every physiological system is low and got fatigue by the end of the day, so there is more of a lactic acid which leads to trouble than any other thing. I recommend you to try out physiotherapy as it will be of great benefit as I have seen 100% of successful results in their physical status. God bless you
Patient: sir my father is suffering from paralysis from past 4 months .His left part is effected .He is able to walk but slowly and he is having a small movement in his left hand. Is there any treatement so that he could recover fast.He is unable to his work on his own since his hand is not supporting.please give me a suggestion so that he could recover fastlyThank You  Doctor: Hi, I understand your concern for your father.1) Firstly since he has had a stroke earlier, you have to very cautious regarding the treatment. The blood pressure has to be in control. Make a chart of BP findings with date and time. Show this to your physician regularly.2) You need to make him follow a strict less salt or low sodium salt diet. Reduce oily foods.3) Since he is already paralyzed, regular physiotherapy sessions have to be taken to improve as much as possible. It is both time taking and painful, but you should do it. This will improve the functions of limbs to much extend.4) Protect him from bed sore by making him sleep on air beds, massage body regularly and apply Newsprint powder on lesions on her body if any. 5) Encourage him to do regular movement of body to improve his condition.6) Take prescribed medications without fail and have regular checkup done. You are a loving kid of your father, take good care of him. Hope I helped you with the suggestions. Let me know if I can assist you further. Best regards,
Patient: Hi, I m a 27yr old female. I ve had a lump on the back right side of my neck for about 2 1/2yrs. It s about 1.5in height and 1in wide. It s given me pain and a tingly sensation off and on ever since it came up. I feel like I also have one deep in the back of my left thigh which aches sometimes. I ve been told it s probably a lipoma. I ve also had drenching night sweats off and on for a couple years and more recently it s been every night. I keep my room very cool and a fan blowing directly on me. I m not overweight either so idk what this is. Any advice on what s going on would help! Thanks!  Doctor: Hello. Thank you for using Chat Doctor. I'm a pathologist. The lump you have sounds like an enlarged lymph node. Since you have night sweats as well, I am suspecting there is an ongoing infection. The best next step for you would be to undergo an FNAC (fine needle aspiration cytology) procedure, wherein the cells in the lump will be aspirated to examine, for the diagnosis. Also, you could do a complete blood count as well. Let me know what the reports are, so I can help you further. Have a happy health.
Patient: Hello Doctor, I recently suffered from Jaundice (Hepatitis A) was under treatment from 26 August 2014 to 4 September 2014. The SGPT count was increased to 10.25 now it has reduced to 2.8(tested on 13 September 2014). I rejoined my office from 11 September 2014. Although I feel I am recovered from Jaundice but from 14 September 2014 I am experiencing pains in my right side of abdominal below ribs and the pain extends till back. Now the intensity of pain has increased. One more point to note is the pain is not continues, the pain occurs only when I make movements especially after driving bike Is it due to lack of rest or is it some other problem?  Doctor: It could be related to your previous hepatitis. Although hepatitis A doesn't lead to chronicity, but incomplete recovery or reinfection cannot be ruled out. You should get a ct scan of abdomen to check around the hepatobiliary system as well as repeat all the liver function tests required for evaluation. But foremost thing, do not delay and visit your doctor. Certain pain relievers like Chat Doctor.  You should have a complete work up done.
Patient: I am 71 5 days ago experienced lightening pain left jaw and I felt unstable as if I might fall I walked carefully across st back to home to ly down. My right shoulder has been sore sense and I favor it. I was very upset and hot trying to negotiate w hoa manager to no avail. I have had two heart bypass on left of heart and stent on right year later. I started Levoquin yesterday for red ears and throat. Temp 100. Dull headache and just want to be still. Been in bed all day had two smoothies. Live alone w daughter close  Doctor: Here you have told you are a heart patient and already operated for it. As well, you had temperature too. And your right shoulder is sore. Now here as per me jaw pain can be associated pain with fever, it can be jaw muscle over strain too, and you Don't need to worry if its subsided. If It's not then you need to use hot pack on your painful jaw. Do not eat anything solid for next 2 days and have soft NAD liquid diet. Do not talk too much. As well Don't do anything which pains. Even then if it's not going then you need to get it checked properly with or tho doctor. Take one x-ray and see there is nothing wrong with jaw joint. Here or tho will guide you for physio treatment for mild strain on joint with ultrasound therapy. And if there is too much of instability then he may suggest for surgical option to improve stability part. But this will be last option so Don't worry. I am sure this will be useful if you follow it properly. Take care.

I can explain to you that these nightmares are mainly due to imbalance between REM (Rapid Eye Movement) and REM (Non-Rapid Eye movement) stages of sleep. In general, these two stages maintain sleep balance for its homeostasis, in your case i.e. in nightmares, the REM activity will be too more than normal, thus the balance is lost. As this is the phase in which the brain is very active, your heart rate will be more, because of all these you are experiencing that kind of restlessness. You can get rid of this problem by following strict sleep hygiene i.e. keeping a regular wake-sleep schedule is very important, which will help to prevent the sleep deprivation that can bring on nightmares, engaging in regular exercise, which will help alleviate your nightmare if they are due to anxiety and stress, You may find yoga and meditation are also helpful. Be cautious about use of alcohol, caffeine, and nicotine, which can remain in your system for more than 12 hours and often disrupt sleep patterns. Make your be Chat Doctor.  I would like to know are you taking any medications? As certain
Patient: my father is 84 yo and is having open prostatectomy, he has a coronary stent and a pacemaker, he has beign taking baby aspirin that was stop almost a week ago, his cardiologist s to put him on a low molecular weight heparin, 40 mg sc once a day. I guess in this case we should outweight the benefits of DVT against bleeding, any comments  Doctor: Thanks for your question on Healthcare on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Yes, definitely, complications like bleeding is more common than DVT at his age of 84 years. And for prevention of DVT, you can give nonmedical measures like lower limb movements, compression stockings etc. These measures prevent DVT without increasing risk for bleeding. So in my opinion, you should discuss these with your doctors and convince them for not using low molecular weight heparin. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your father. Thanks.
Patient: i had a total hip replacement with a DePuy Pennicle hip. The Lateral Femoral Cutaneous Nerve was completely severed. The pain has become unbearable. Now they are recommending Nerve Blocks. I also have elevated chromium and cobalt. Not really high but elevated. Do you think Nerve Blocks will help my pain?  Doctor: Hello, As what I feel is that taking nerve block isn't bad, and it will help block the pain sensation. Post this I will advise you to do total hip rehabilitation programming post surgery. This will help the muscles to be stronger and provide maximum stability of the newly installed joint. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Jay In Chat Doctor.

Patient: hello, i am a 41 year old mother of three and i noticed a little bump under myright arm lately. whenever i touch it or massage it , release gas through my mouth.

Patient: I have a history of ovarian fibroids , once was hemoraghic , but dicipated. 2 years ago i started mammograms, for right breast pain, and rarely, leakage. They have found a mass, but I was reassured, again last year, that it is non growing, encapsulated, and most likely benign . When I didn t ike that verbage, the doctor stated I needed to relax, it was just a mass, not cancer. .... I recently fell on ice, and injured my back. The MRI this week states that they accidently found : partly imaged complex appearing cycstic mass anterior to retroflexed uterus . This is incompletely evaluated but measures about up to 7.7 cm in long axis. it effaces the superior aspect of the bladder . Am I right to be freaking out? Should I be worried about cancer? Does this mean imenent surgery?  Doctor: Dear Ma'am, Sorry to hear about your condition, but I am glad that you are seeking medical attention for the same. Firstly the breast mass does appear to be benign by your description, and you just need to regularly follow up with your doctor regarding that. The complex cystic mass which was discovered recently on MRI needs to be evaluated further, and you need to visit a gynecologist for the same. The decision for surgery would only be decided after evaluating the nature of the cyst. Hope you get well soon.
