STUDY OBJECTIVE: To describe sleep characteristics and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder in patients with Guadeloupean atypical parkinsonism (Gd-PSP), a tauopathy resembling progressive supranuclear palsy that mainly affects the midbrain. It is possibly caused by the ingestion of sour sop (corossol), a tropical fruit containing acetogenins, which are mitochondrial poisons.DESIGN: Sleep interview, motor and cognitive tests, and overnight videopolysomnography.PATIENTS: Thirty-six age-, sex-, disease-duration- and disability-matched patients with Gd-PSP (n = 9), progressive supranuclear palsy (a tauopathy, n = 9), Parkinson disease (a synucleinopathy, n = 9) and controls (n = 9).SETTINGS: Tertiary-care academic hospital.RESULTS: REM sleep behavior disorder was found in 78% patients with Gd-PSP (43% of patients reported having this disorder several years before the onset of parkinsonism), 44% of patients with idiopathic Parkinson disease, 33% of patients with progressive supranuclear palsy, and no controls. The percentage of muscle activity during REM sleep was greater in patients with Gd-PSP than in controls (limb muscle activity, 8.3%+/-8.7% vs 0.1%+/- 0.2%; chin muscle activity, 24.3%+/- 23.7% vs 0.7%+/-2.0%) but similar to that of other patient groups. The latency and percentage of REM sleep were similar in patients with Gd-PSP, patients with Parkinson disease, and controls, whereas patients with progressive supranuclear palsy had delayed and shortened REM sleep.CONCLUSION: Although Gd-PSP is a tauopathy, most patients experience REM sleep behavior disorder. This suggests that the location of neuronal loss or dysfunction in the midbrain, rather than the protein comprising the histologic lesions (synuclein versus tau aggregation), is responsible for suppressing muscle atonia during REM sleep. Subjects with idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder should avoid eating sour sop.
INTRODUCTION: Vaccinations in school-aged children are required by state and local law to maintain high vaccination coverage rates, as well as low rates of vaccine-preventable diseases. Diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis are childhood diseases that can be life threatening; poliomyelitis, another childhood disease, can be disabling. In turn, vaccinations were developed to provide protection against these diseases. Today, several vaccinations are recommended for children, including but not limited to diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (DTaP) and poliomyelitis (IPV). DTaP requires five doses, and IPV requires four. Quadracel (diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis adsorbed and inactivated poliovirus vaccine, Sanofi Pasteur Inc.) is a new vaccination developed to condense the last dose of both DTaP and IPV so they do not have to be given separately, thus reducing the total number of vaccinations required.DISCUSSION: The Quadracel vaccine is an option for use in children who are completing the DTaP and IPV series. In a randomized, controlled, phase 3, pivotal trial, Quadracel proved to be as efficacious and safe as Daptacel (diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine adsorbed, Sanofi Pasteur Inc.) and IPOL (poliovirus vaccine inactivated, Sanofi Pasteur Inc.), given separately, to children between the ages of 4 and 6 years.CONCLUSION: Quadracel should be recommended to parents who have children between the ages of 4 and 6 years who meet the necessary administration criteria and need to finalize their DTaP and IPV series. Quadracel's administration in the vaccination series replaces one additional injection, which may benefit children who are afraid of receiving shots and parents who need to schedule one less doctor's appointment.

Botulism is a potentially lethal disease caused by one of seven homologous neurotoxic proteins usually produced by the bacterium, Clostridium botulinum. This neuromuscular disorder occurs through an exquisite series of molecular events, ultimately ending with the arrest of acetylcholine release and hence, flaccid paralysis. There are three types of botulism: food, wound, and infant botulism. Most strains of the bacterium produce a potent, respiratory muscle-paralyzing neurotoxin, botulinum toxin (BTX). It can lead to death unless appropriate therapy is promptly initiated. Due to the severity and potency of BTX, its importance as a biological weapon is of major concern to public health officials. Nevertheless, BTX is also medicament.
BACKGROUND: Miller-Fisher syndrome is characterised by the clinical triad of ophthalmoplegia, ataxia and areflexia and is considered a variant form of Guillain-Barré syndrome. In western countries the incidence is reported to be approximately 1-5% that of Guillain-Barré syndrome. Approximately 90% of patients have antibodies against the ganglioside GQ1b, which is of diagnostic and pathogenic importance.MATERIAL AND METHODS: We present two patients with Miller-Fisher syndrome and describe clinical features and possible mechanisms of GQ1b antibodies.RESULTS AND INTERPRETATION: Both patients presented with the classical triad of symptoms and GQ1b antibodies after upper respiratory tract infections. One of the patients had a more severe form with additional bulbar signs and was treated with plasma exchange. Both made almost complete recoveries within a few months.
Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are unique in that they have the capacity to differentiate into all of the cell types in the body. We know a lot about the complex transcriptional control circuits that maintain the naive pluripotent state under self-renewing conditions but comparatively less about how cells exit from this state in response to differentiation stimuli. Here, we examined the role of Otx2 in this process in mouse ESCs and demonstrate that it plays a leading role in remodeling the gene regulatory networks as cells exit from ground state pluripotency. Otx2 drives enhancer activation through affecting chromatin marks and the activity of associated genes. Mechanistically, Oct4 is required for Otx2 expression, and reciprocally, Otx2 is required for efficient Oct4 recruitment to many enhancer regions. Therefore, the Oct4-Otx2 regulatory axis actively establishes a new regulatory chromatin landscape during the early events that accompany exit from ground state pluripotency.
FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3- internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD) remains as one of the most frequently mutated genes in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), especially in those with normal cytogenetics. The FLT3-ITD and FLT3-TKD (tyrosine kinase domain) mutations are biomarkers for high risk AML and are associated with drug resistance and high risk of relapse. Multiple FLT3 inhibitors are in clinical development, including lestaurtinib, tandutinib, quizartinib, midostaurin, gilteritinib, and crenolanib. Midostaurin and gilteritinib have been approved by FDA for Flt3 mutated AML. Gilteritinib (ASP2215, Xospata) is a small molecule dual inhibitor of FLT3/AXL. The ADMIRAL study showed that longer overall survival and higher response rate are associated with gilteritinib in comparison with salvage chemotherapy for relapse /refractory (R/R) AML. These data from the ADMIRAL study may lead to the therapy paradigm shift and establish gilteritinib as the new standard therapy for R/R FLT3-mutated AML. Currently, multiple clinical trials are ongoing to evaluate the combination of gilteritinib with other agents and regimens. This study summarized clinical trials of gilteritinib for AML.
The recent successes of immune check point targeting therapies in treating cancer patients has driven a resurgence of interest in targeting these pathways in chronically infected patients. While still in early stages, basic and clinical data suggest that blockade of CTLA-4 and PD-1 can be beneficial in the treatment of chronic HIV, HBV, and HCV infection, as well as other chronic maladies. Furthermore, novel inhibitory receptors such as Tim-3, LAG-3, and TIGIT are the potential next wave of check points that can be manipulated for the treatment of chronic infection. Blockade of these pathways influences more than simply T cell responses, and may provide new therapeutic options for chronically infected patients.
Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a movement disorder characterized by abnormal involuntary facial movements induced by chronic therapy with classical antipsychotic medications. Currently, there is no satisfactory pharmacotherapy for TD, which represents a major limitation to therapy with classical antipsychotics. In order to develop or optimize therapies for TD, and to develop new APDs with lower indices of motor side effects, the pathology underlying TD must first be understood. The use of animal models has been used to further this objective. Here, we review different preparations that have been used to model TD and discuss the contribution of neuroimaging studies conducted in these models. Studies in animal models have lead to several hypotheses of TD pathology, although none has yet emerged as the ultimate underlying cause of this syndrome. We discuss alterations in functional indices, neuron and synapse morphology and changes in specific neurotransmitter systems that have been described in animal models of TD, and outline how these findings have contributed to our understanding of antipsychotic-induced dyskinesias. We conclude that several non-mutually exclusive theories of TD are supported by animal studies, including increases in oxidative stress leading to structural and functional changes in specific neurotransmitter systems. Elucidating the mechanisms underlying TD neuropathology partly through the use of animal models will lead to the development of APDs with superior side effect profiles or more effective therapies for TD.
BACKGROUND: Nicotine receptor partial agonists may help smokers to quit by a combination of maintaining moderate levels of dopamine to counteract withdrawal symptoms (acting as an agonist) and reducing smoking satisfaction (acting as an antagonist). Varenicline was developed as a nicotine receptor partial agonist from cytisine, a drug widely used in central and eastern Europe for smoking cessation. The first trial reports of varenicline were released in 2006, and further trials are underway.OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this review is to assess the efficacy and tolerability of nicotine receptor partial agonists, including varenicline and cytisine, for smoking cessation.SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group's specialised register for trials, using the terms ('varenicline' or 'cytisine' or 'Tabex' or 'nicotine receptor partial agonist') and 'smoking' in the title or abstract, or as keywords. We also searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and CINAHL using MeSH terms and free text, and we contacted authors of trial reports for additional information where necessary. The last search was in October 2006.SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials which compared the treatment drug with placebo. We also included comparisons with bupropion where available. We excluded trials which did not report a minimum follow-up period of six months from start of treatment.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We extracted data in duplicate on the type of participants, the dose and duration of treatment, the outcome measures, the randomization procedure, concealment of allocation, and completeness of follow up. The main outcome measured was abstinence from smoking after at least six months from the beginning of treatment. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence, and preferred biochemically validated rates where they were reported. Where appropriate we performed meta-analysis using the Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect model.MAIN RESULTS: We found five trials of varenicline compared with placebo for smoking cessation; three of these also included a bupropion experimental arm. We also found one relapse prevention trial, comparing varenicline with placebo. The six trials covered 4924 participants, 2451 of whom used varenicline. We identified one trial of cytisine (Tabex) for inclusion. The pooled odds ratio (OR) for continuous abstinence at 12 months for varenicline versus placebo was 3.22 (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.43 to 4.27). The pooled OR for varenicline versus bupropion was 1.66 (95% CI 1.28 to 2.16). The main adverse effect of varenicline was nausea, which was mostly at mild to moderate levels and usually subsided over time. The two trials which tested the use of varenicline beyond the 12-week standard regimen found the drug to be well-tolerated and effective during long-term use. The one cytisine trial included in this review found that more participants taking cytisine stopped smoking compared with placebo at two-year follow up, with an OR of 1.77 (95% CI 1.30 to 2.40).AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Varenicline increased the odds of successful long-term smoking cessation approximately threefold compared with pharmacologically unassisted quit attempts. In trials reported so far, more participants quit successfully with varenicline than with bupropion. The effectiveness of varenicline as an aid to relapse prevention has not been clearly established. The main adverse effect of varenciline is nausea, but this is mostly at mild to moderate levels and tends to reduce with habituation. There is a need for independent trials of varenicline versus placebo, to test the early findings. There is also a need for direct comparisons with nicotine replacement therapy, and for further trials with bupropion, to establish the relative efficacy of the treatments.Cytisine may also increase the chances of quitting, but the evidence at present is inconclusive.
BACKGROUND: The abundance of gene expression microarray data has led to the development of machine learning algorithms applicable for tackling disease diagnosis, disease prognosis, and treatment selection problems. However, these algorithms often produce classifiers with weaknesses in terms of accuracy, robustness, and interpretability. This paper introduces fuzzy support vector machine which is a learning algorithm based on combination of fuzzy classifiers and kernel machines for microarray classification.RESULTS: Experimental results on public leukemia, prostate, and colon cancer datasets show that fuzzy support vector machine applied in combination with filter or wrapper feature selection methods develops a robust model with higher accuracy than the conventional microarray classification models such as support vector machine, artificial neural network, decision trees, k nearest neighbors, and diagonal linear discriminant analysis. Furthermore, the interpretable rule-base inferred from fuzzy support vector machine helps extracting biological knowledge from microarray data.CONCLUSIONS: Fuzzy support vector machine as a new classification model with high generalization power, robustness, and good interpretability seems to be a promising tool for gene expression microarray classification.
Melioidosis is a tropical disease of high mortality caused by the environmental bacterium, Burkholderia pseudomallei. We have collected clinical isolates from the highly endemic Northern Territory of Australia routinely since 1989, and animal and environmental B. pseudomallei isolates since 1991. Here we provide a complete record of all B. pseudomallei multilocus sequence types (STs) found in the Northern Territory to date, and distribution maps of the eight most common environmental STs. We observed surprisingly restricted geographic distributions of STs, which is contrary to previous reports suggesting widespread environmental dissemination of this bacterium. Our data suggest that B. pseudomallei from soil and water does not frequently disperse long distances following severe weather events or by migration of infected animals.
Willis-Ekbom's disease (WED), formerly called restless legs syndrome, is more common in pregnant than in non-pregnant women, implying that the physiological and biochemical changes during pregnancy influence its development. During pregnancy, many hormone levels undergo significant changes, and some hormones significantly increase in activity and can interfere with other hormones. For example, the steroid hormone estradiol interferes with the neuroendocrine hormone dopamine. During pregnancy, the activity of the thyroid axis is enhanced to meet the increased demand for thyroid hormones during this state. Dopamine is a neuroendocrine hormone that diminishes the levels of thyrotropin and consequently of thyroxine, and one of the roles of the dopaminergic system is to counteract the activity of thyroid hormones. When the activity of dopamine is not sufficient to modulate thyroid hormones, WED may occur. Robust evidence in the medical literature suggests that an imbalance between thyroid hormones and the dopaminergic system underpins WED pathophysiology. In this article, we present evidence that this imbalance may also mediate transient WED during pregnancy. It is possible that the main hormonal alteration responsible for transient WED of pregnancy is the excessive modulation of dopamine release in the pituitary stalk by estradiol. The reduced quantities of dopamine then cause decreased modulation of thyrotropin, leading to enhanced thyroid axis activity and subsequent WED symptoms. Iron deficiency may also be a predisposing factor for WED during pregnancy, as it can both diminish dopamine and increase thyroid hormone.
PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This article focuses on the clinical presentation, pathophysiology, diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and management of narcolepsy type 1 and narcolepsy type 2, idiopathic hypersomnia, Kleine-Levin syndrome, and other central disorders of hypersomnolence, as defined in the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, Third Edition (ICSD-3).RECENT FINDINGS: In ICSD-3, the names of some central disorders of hypersomnolence have been changed: narcolepsy with cataplexy and narcolepsy without cataplexy have been renamed narcolepsy type 1 and narcolepsy type 2, respectively. A low level of hypocretin-1/orexin-A in the CSF is now theoretically sufficient to diagnose narcolepsy type 1, as it is a highly specific and sensitive biomarker. Conversely, other central hypersomnias are less well-defined disorders with variability in the phenotype, and few reliable biomarkers have been discovered so far. The epidemiologic observation that influenza A (H1N1) infection and vaccination are potential triggering factors of narcolepsy type 1 (discovered during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic) has increased interest in this rare disease, and progress is being made to better understand the process (highly suspected to be autoimmune) responsible for the destruction of hypocretin neurons. Treatment of narcolepsy remains largely symptomatic, usually initially with modafinil or armodafinil or with higher-potency stimulants such as methylphenidate or amphetamines. Several newer wake-promoting agents and psychostimulants have also been developed, including sodium oxybate, which has a role in the treatment of cataplexy and as an adjunctive wake-promoting agent, and pitolisant, a selective histamine H3 receptor inverse agonist that is currently only available in Europe.SUMMARY: Although far less common than many other sleep disorders, central hypersomnias are among the most severe and disabling diseases in the field of sleep medicine, and their early recognition is of major importance for patients, especially children, to maximize their quality of life and functioning in activities of daily living.
In swim-up-selected spermatozoa of 38 normozoospermic patients, capacitated spermatozoa exhibited enhanced pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) activity and increased expression of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD). The G6PD inhibitor DHEA and the inhibitors of NADPH oxidase apocynin and diphenylene iodonium (DPI) prevented both superoxide generation and capacitation in human spermatozoa, but whereas DPI and DHEA inhibited PPP, apocynin did not influence it, suggesting that PPP activation during capacitation is not a response to increased oxidative stress but exerts a role by supplying reducing equivalents to oxygen.
Although best known as a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), tamoxifen is a drug with a wide range of activities. Tamoxifen has demonstrated some efficacy has a therapeutic for bipolar mania and is believed to exert these effects through inhibition of protein kinase C (PKC). As the symptoms of amphetamine treatment in rodents are believed to mimic the symptoms of a manic episode, many of the preclinical studies for this indication have demonstrated that tamoxifen inhibits amphetamine action. The amphetamine-induced increase in extracellular dopamine which gives rise to the 'manic' effects is due to interaction of amphetamine with the dopamine transporter. We and others have demonstrated that PKC reduces amphetamine-induced reverse transport through the dopamine transporter. In this review, we will outline the actions of tamoxifen as a SERM and further detail another known action of tamoxifen-inhibition of PKC. We will summarize the literature showing how tamoxifen affects amphetamine action. Finally, we will present our hypothesis that tamoxifen, or an analog, could be used therapeutically to reduce amphetamine abuse in addition to treating mania.
Fanconi anemia (FA), an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a progressive pancytopenia associated with congenital anomalies and high predisposition to malignancies, is a genetically and clinically heterogeneous disease. At least eight complementation groups (FA-A to FA-H) have been identified. Previously, we studied mutations of the FANCA gene, responsible for FA-A, and found pathogenic mutations in 12 of 15 unclassified Japanese FA patients. Here, we further studied an additional 5 FA patients for sequence alterations of the FANCA gene and found pathogenic mutations in 2 of them. We further analyzed mutations of the FANCC and FANCG genes, responsible for FA-C and FA-G, respectively, in the remaining 6 FA patients. Although there was no alterations in the FANCC gene in these 6 patients, two novel mutations of the FANCG gene, causing aberrant RNA splicing, were detected in 2 FA patients. One was a base substitution from G to C of the invariant GT dinucleotides at the splice donor site of intron 3, resulting in the skipping of exon 3, as well as the skipping of exons 3 and 4. The other was a base substitution from C to T in exon 8, creating a nonsense codon (Q356X). This mutation resulted in the exclusion of a sequence of 18 nucleotides containing the mutation from the mRNA, without affecting the splicing potential of either the authentic or the cryptic splice donor site. Collectively, 14 of the 20 unclassified Japanese FA patients belong to the FA-A group, 2 belong to the FA-G group, and none belongs to the FA-C group.
Interpatient variability in the safety and efficacy of oral anticoagulation with warfarin presents several challenges to clinicians, thus underscoring the emergent need for new orally available anticoagulants with predictable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles and ability to target circulating clotting factors. Seven compounds including rivaroxaban, apixaban, betrixaban, and eribaxaban are orally available direct inhibitors of activated factor X currently in development for the prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism and for thromboprophylaxis in patients with atrial fibrillation or following an acute coronary syndrome. At doses used in phase 2 and 3 clinical trials, rivaroxaban and apixaban demonstrated a predictable onset of effect, maximal plasma concentration, and half-life that was unaffected by age, renal, or hepatic disease. In clinical trials for the treatment and prevention of venous thromboembolism, rivaroxaban and apixaban produced equivalent or superior reductions in the development or progression of venous thromboembolism compared with either low molecular weight heparin or warfarin. Trials comparing the efficacy of rivaroxaban or apixaban to standard therapy for stroke prophylaxis in patients with atrial fibrillation are in process. Rivaroxaban, the sentinel compound in this class, is already approved in the European Union and Canada. It is likely to be approved for use in the United States in 2010.
Turnover of mRNA in the cytoplasm of human cells is thought to be redundantly conducted by the monomeric 5'-3' exoribonuclease hXRN1 and the 3'-5' exoribonucleolytic RNA exosome complex. However, in addition to the exosome-associated 3'-5' exonucleases hDIS3 and hDIS3L, the human genome encodes another RNase II/R domain protein-hDIS3L2. Here, we show that hDIS3L2 is an exosome-independent cytoplasmic mRNA 3'-5' exonuclease, which exhibits processive activity on structured RNA substrates in vitro. hDIS3L2 associates with hXRN1 in an RNA-dependent manner and can, like hXRN1, be found on polysomes. The impact of hDIS3L2 on cytoplasmic RNA metabolism is revealed by an increase in levels of cytoplasmic RNA processing bodies (P-bodies) upon hDIS3L2 depletion, which also increases half-lives of investigated mRNAs. Consistently, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analyses demonstrate that depletion of hDIS3L2, like downregulation of hXRN1 and hDIS3L, causes changed levels of multiple mRNAs. We suggest that hDIS3L2 is a key exosome-independent effector of cytoplasmic mRNA metabolism.
BACKGROUND: The clinical, morphological, and electrocardiographical relevance of delayed enhancement (DE) in cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) was studied in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM).METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 56 patients underwent both gadolinium-enhanced CMR and 12-lead electrocardiogram. The CMR demonstrated DE at the left ventricular (LV) wall in 39 patients. The patients with DE included more cases with dilated phase of HCM, higher New York Heart Association (NYHA) classes and incidence of ventricular tachyarrhythmias (VT), lower LV ejection fraction (LVEF) and mean LV wall thickness (WT), and a larger ratio of maximum to minimum LVWT. The QRS duration was prolonged and the QRS axis deviated toward left with increases in the DE volume (r = 0.58 and r = 0.41, P < .01). Abnormal Q waves were present in 5 patients and the location coincided with the DE segments in 4 patients, but the concordance was not significant. The amplitude of T waves correlated with the ratio of the apex to basal LVWT (r = 0.38, P < .01) and was more negative in cases with DE at the apex.CONCLUSIONS: In HCM, the DE was associated with higher NYHA classes and prevalence of VT, impaired global LV function and asymmetrical hypertrophy, and conduction disturbance, abnormal Q waves, and giant negative T waves.
Adipose tissue is a major metabolic organ, and it has been traditionally classified as either white adipose tissue (WAT) or brown adipose tissue (BAT). WAT and BAT are characterized by different anatomical locations, morphological structures, functions, and regulations. WAT and BAT are both involved in energy balance. WAT is mainly involved in the storage and mobilization of energy in the form of triglycerides, whereas BAT specializes in dissipating energy as heat during cold- or diet-induced thermogenesis. Recently, brown-like adipocytes were discovered in WAT. These brown-like adipocytes that appear in WAT are called beige or brite adipocytes. Interestingly, these beige/brite cells resemble white fat cells in the basal state, but they respond to thermogenic stimuli with increased levels of thermogenic genes and increased respiration rates. In addition, beige/brite cells have a gene expression pattern distinct from that of either white or brown fat cells. The current epidemic of obesity has increased the interest in studying adipocyte formation (adipogenesis), especially in beige/brite cells. This review summarizes the developmental process of adipose tissues that originate from the mesenchymal stem cells and the features of these three different types of adipocytes.
In eukaryotic organisms, initiation of mRNA turnover is controlled by progressive shortening of the poly-A tail, a process involving the mega-Dalton Ccr4-Not complex and its two associated 3'-5' exonucleases, Ccr4p and Pop2p (Caf1p). RNA degradation by the 3'-5' DEDDh exonuclease, Pop2p, is governed by the classical two metal ion mechanism traditionally assumed to be dependent on Mg(2+) ions bound in the active site. Here, we show biochemically and structurally that fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe) Pop2p prefers Mn(2+) and Zn(2+) over Mg(2+) at the concentrations of the ions found inside cells and that the identity of the ions in the active site affects the activity of the enzyme. Ion replacement experiments further suggest that mRNA deadenylation could be subtly regulated by local Zn(2+) levels in the cell. Finally, we use site-directed mutagenesis to propose a mechanistic model for the basis of the preference for poly-A sequences exhibited by the Pop2p-type deadenylases as well as their distributive enzymatic behavior.
BACKGROUND: The aim of this paper is to describe the clinical features and molecular findings of a unique case of Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON)/mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) overlap syndrome presenting as nonischemic central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO).METHODS: An 11-year-old Chinese girl presented with sudden onset of bilateral blurred vision. The clinical history, imaging studies, and molecular analysis results were reviewed. The PubMed and OVID databases were used for literature review.RESULTS: Nonischemic CRVO in the subject's right eye and tortuosity of small and medium-sized retinal arterioles in the left eye were found at initial presentation. Bilateral optic disc pallor was then noted with recovery of CRVO. Severe headache and several stroke-like episodes occurred subsequently, with elevated lactate levels in serum and cerebrospinal fluid. LHON/MELAS overlap syndrome was diagnosed, and mitochondrial DNA sequencing revealed G13513A heteroplasmic mutation. Vision was 20/30 in the right eye and 20/800 in the left eye at the last visit.CONCLUSIONS: Mitochondrial DNA G13513A mutation can cause LHON/MELAS overlap syndrome. Nonischemic CRVO is a rare manifestation of LHON/MELAS. Atypical findings in cases of LHON should raise the suspicion of overlap syndrome or other mitochondrial diseases.
A 7-year-old girl was admitted to the hospital for anaemia, secondary to intestinal blood los (melaena). She was found to have 45,X Turner's syndrome. Her identical twin sister also had Turner's syndrome with a 45,X chromosome complement. According to various criteria the probability of monozygosity was 0.9905. Although the incidence of twinning is greater than usual in families of patients with Turner's syndrome, affected cases have only been observed in twin sisters on six occasions. It seems therefore that the 45,X chromosome complement itself is not a factor predisposing to twinning, but that in some families, a factor is at play, which cuases either twinning or the 45,X aneuploidy, or both.
LYMPHOMA RISK: Lymphoma is a very severe complication of primary Sjögren's syndrome: 5 to 10% of patients followed for more than 10 years will develop a lymphoma. Predictive factors include serum monoclonal immunoglobulins or cryoglobulins and a B clone population in accessory salivary glands. TYPICAL CLINICAL AND HISTOLOGICAL PRESENTATION: Mucosal involvement (parotid as well as gastric or pulmonary localizations) is frequent. According to the recent classification of lymphomas, most lymphomas developing in patients with Sjögren's syndrome are B lymphomas of the marginal zone: MALT lymphomas or low-grade nodal monocytoid lymphomas which are sometimes not identified until transformation to the giant cell stage. SIMILARITIES WITH HEPATITIS C LYMPHOMAS: The pathophysiology of lymphoma in Sjögrën's syndrome remains unknown. To date, there is no argument favoring a viral infection or a deregulation of a unique oncogene or anti-oncogene. Certain similarities between lymphomas in Sjögren's syndrome and lymphomas associated with hepatitic C virus would suggest a common pathogenisis: possibly a permanent stimulation of auto-reactive B cells carrying a surface immunoglobulin with rheumatoid factor activity in the target organs of the autoimmune disease. These B lymphocytes would then proliferate secondarily.
Cutaneous pigmentation is a major determinant of the cutaneous response to ultraviolet radiation, and consequently of the risk of developing skin cancer. Over the past 10 years, several genes involved in melanogenesis have been identified, including the melanocortin 1 receptor gene. Recent work on the melanocortin 1 receptor suggests that it is a key player in determining whether eumelanin or pheomelanin is predominantly produced both in vitro and in vivo. In the mouse, variants of this receptor, which differ in their ability to activate adenylyl cyclase, are associated with different coat colors. In humans, melanocortin 1 receptor variants are associated with red hair and fair skin, and work in progress from our laboratory suggests that certain melanocortin 1 receptor variants may preferentially be associated with hair color rather than skin type. In addition, melanocortin 1 receptor variants are a risk factor, possibly independent of skin type, for melanoma susceptibility.
Cell migration is dependent on a series of integrated cellular events including the membrane recycling of the extracellular matrix receptor integrins. In this paper, we investigate the role of autophagy in regulating cell migration. In a wound-healing assay, we observed that autophagy was reduced in cells at the leading edge than in cells located rearward. These differences in autophagy were correlated with the robustness of MTOR activity. The spatial difference in the accumulation of autophagic structures was not detected in rapamycin-treated cells, which had less migration capacity than untreated cells. In contrast, the knockdown of the autophagic protein ATG7 stimulated cell migration of HeLa cells. Accordingly, atg3(-/-) and atg5(-/-) MEFs have greater cell migration properties than their wild-type counterparts. Stimulation of autophagy increased the co-localization of β1 integrin-containing vesicles with LC3-stained autophagic vacuoles. Moreover, inhibition of autophagy slowed down the lysosomal degradation of internalized β1 integrins and promoted its membrane recycling. From these findings, we conclude that autophagy regulates cell migration, a central mechanism in cell development, angiogenesis, and tumor progression, by mitigating the cell surface expression of β1 integrins.
In mammalian cells, proteins involved in mRNA silencing and degradation localize to discrete cytoplasmic foci called processing or P-bodies. Here we show that microscopically visible P-bodies are greatly diminished following West Nile viral infection, but the component proteins are not depleted. On the other hand, many P-body components including LSM1, GW182, DDX3, DDX6 and XRN1, but not others like DCP1a and EDC4 are recruited to the viral replication sites, as evidenced by their colocalization at perinuclear region with viral NS3. Kinetic studies suggest that the component proteins are first released from P-bodies in response to WNV infection within 12 h post-infection, followed by recruitment to the viral replication sites by 24-36 h post-infection. Silencing of the recruited proteins individually with siRNA interfered with viral replication to varying extents suggesting that the recruited proteins are required for efficient viral replication. Thus, the P-body proteins might provide novel drug targets for inhibiting viral infection.
BACKGROUND: Flibanserin, a novel serotonin (5-HT)(1A) agonist and 5-HT(2A) antagonist, has been shown to increase sexual desire and reduce distress in women with Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder (HSDD). In marmoset monkeys, flibanserin has demonstrated pro-social effects on male-female pairmates, while the classic 5-HT(1A) agonist 8-OH-DPAT suppresses female sexual behavior and increases aggressive interactions between pairmates. Activation of 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(2A) receptors is known to stimulate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. This study aims to characterize the effects of repeated flibanserin and 8-OH-DPAT administration on the marmoset HPA axis and to elucidate endocrine correlates of altered marmoset pair behavior.METHODS: Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol were examined at baseline and during 5-HT(1A) agonist and restraint challenges in 8 female marmoset monkeys receiving daily flibanserin (15mg/kg) and an additional 8 female marmosets receiving 8-OH-DPAT (0.1mg/kg) for 15-16weeks. Corresponding vehicle treatments were administered in a counterbalanced, within-subject design. All females were housed in stable male-female pairs. Treatment-induced changes in ACTH and cortisol levels were correlated with previously assessed marmoset pair behavior.RESULTS: While morning basal cortisol levels and HPA responses to a 5-HT(1A) agonist challenge were not altered by chronic flibanserin or 8-OH-DPAT, both treatments increased the responsiveness of the marmoset HPA axis to restraint. Enhanced ACTH responses to restraint correlated with reduced sexual receptivity and increased aggression in 8-OH-DPAT-, but not in flibanserin-treated female marmosets.CONCLUSIONS: Unaltered HPA responses to a 5-HT(1A) agonist challenge after chronic flibanserin and 8-OH-DPAT treatments indicate little or no de-sensitization of the HPA axis to repeated 5-HT(1A) manipulation. Chronic 8-OH-DPAT, but not flibanserin, leads to aggravated ACTH responses to stress that may contribute to anti-sexual and anti-social behavior between 8-OH-DPAT-treated females and their male pairmates. Despite similar flibanserin and 8-OH-DPAT induced ACTH responses to restraint stress, flibanserin-treated females show unchanged cortisol profiles. This is possibly due to flibanserin's regional selectivity in 5-HT(1A) activation and concurrent 5-HT(2A) inhibition. The contrasting restraint-related cortisol responses emulate contrasting behavioral phenotypes of diminished pair-bond of 8-OH-DPAT-treated females compared to the more affiliative pair-bond of flibanserin-treated females.
OBJECTIVES: Experimental evidence has indicated the benefit of simvastatin in the treatment of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Recently, acute simvastatin treatment was not shown to be beneficial in neurological outcome using modified Rankin Scale. Cognitive function is another important dimension of outcome assessment and yet had not been investigated in statin studies for aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. We therefore explored whether acute simvastatin treatment would improve cognitive outcomes.METHODS: The study recruited SAH patients with acute simvastatin treatment enrolled in a randomized controlled double-blinded clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01038193). A control cohort of SAH patients without simvastatin treatment was identified with propensity score matching of age and admission grade. Primary outcome measure was Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Secondary outcome measures were delayed ischaemic deficit (DID), delayed cerebral infarction, modified Rankin Scale (mRS), and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE).RESULTS: Fifty-one SAH patients with acute simvastatin treatment and 51 SAH patients without simvastatin treatment were recruited for analysis. At 3 months, there were no differences in MoCA scores (MoCA: 21+/-6 vs. 21+/-5, p=0.772). MoCA-assessed cognitive impairment (MoCA<26) was not different (75% vs. 80%, OR 0.7, 95%CI 0.3 to 1.8, p=0.477). There were also no differences in DID, delayed cerebral infarction, favorable mRS outcome, and MMSE scores, and MMSE-assessed cognitive impairment between both groups.CONCLUSIONS: The current study does not support that acute simvastatin treatment improves cognitive outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.
INTRODUCTION: Present-day rational drug design approaches are based on exploiting unique features of the target biomolecules, small- or macromolecule drug candidates and physical forces that govern their interactions. The 2013 Nobel Prize in chemistry awarded 'for the development of multiscale models for complex chemical systems' once again demonstrated the importance of the tailored drug discovery that reduces the role of the trial-and-error approach to a minimum. The intentional dissemination of Bacillus anthracis spores in 2001 via the so-called anthrax letters has led to increased efforts, politically and scientifically, to develop medical countermeasures that will protect people from the threat of anthrax bioterrorism.AREAS COVERED: This article provides an overview of the recent rational drug design approaches for discovering inhibitors of anthrax toxin. The review also directs the readers to the vast literature on the recognized advances and future possibilities in the field.EXPERT OPINION: Existing options to combat anthrax toxin lethality are limited. With the only anthrax toxin inhibiting therapy (protective antigen-targeting with a monoclonal antibody, raxibacumab) approved to treat inhalational anthrax, the situation, in our view, is still insecure. Further, the FDA's animal rule for drug approval, which clears compounds without validated efficacy studies on humans, creates a high level of uncertainty, especially when a well-characterized animal model does not exist. Better identification and validation of anthrax toxin therapeutic targets at the molecular level as well as elucidation of the parameters determining the corresponding therapeutic windows are still necessary for more effective therapeutic options.
Studies were conducted to ascertain the temporal and dose-dependent effects of nicotinic ligand exposure on functional activity of different nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subtypes, as expressed by cells of the PC12 rat pheochromocytoma (ganglia-type nAChR) or the TE671/RD human (muscle-type nAChR) clonal line. Chronic (3-72-h) agonist (nicotine or carbamylcholine) treatment of cells led to a complete (TE671) or nearly complete (PC12) loss of functional nAChR responses, which is referred to as "functional inactivation." Some inactivation of nAChR function was also observed for the nicotinic ligands d-tubocurarine (d-TC), mecamylamine, and decamethonium. Half-maximal inactivation of nAChR function was observed within 3 min for TE671 cells and within 10 min for PC12 cells treated with inactivating ligands. Functional inactivation occurred with dose dependencies that could not always be reconciled with those obtained for acute agonist activation of nAChR function or for acute inhibition of those responses by d-TC, decamethonium, or mecamylamine. Treatment of TE671 or PC12 cells with the nicotinic antagonist pancuronium or alcuronium alone had no effect on levels of expression of functional nAChRs. However, evidence was obtained that either of these antagonists protected TE671 cell muscle-type nAChRs or PC12 cell ganglia-type nAChRs from functional inactivation on long-term treatment with agonists. Recovery of TE671 cell nAChR function following treatment with carbamylcholine, nicotine, or d-TC occurred with half-times of 1-3 days whether cells were maintained in situ or harvested and replated after removal of ligand. By contrast, 50% recovery of functional nAChRs on PC12 cells occurred within 2-6 h after drug removal. In either case the time course for recovery from nAChR functional inactivation is much slower than recovery from nAChR "functional desensitization," which is a reversible process that occurs on shorter-term (0-5-min) agonist exposure of cells. These results indicate that ganglia-type and muscle-type nAChRs are similar in their sensitivities to functional inactivation by nicotinic ligands but differ in their rates of recovery from and onset of those effects. The ability of drugs such as the agonists d-TC, decamethonium, and mecamylamine to induce functional inactivation may relate to their activities as partial/full agonists, channel blockers, and/or allosteric regulators. Effects of drugs such as pancuronium and alcuronium are likely to reflect simple competitive inhibition of primary ligand binding at functional activation sites.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
Bow hunter's stroke results from vertebrobasilar insufficiency caused by mechanical occlusion or stenosis of the vertebral artery (VA) at the C1-2 level on head rotation. Surgical treatment of this condition may be chosen to avoid life-threatening accidents or because patients complain that conservative treatments such as verbal warnings or use of a neck brace to limit head and neck rotation are ineffective and thus restrict their lifestyle. Posterior fusion involving C1-2 has long been used to limit atlantoaxial rotational movements. However, it has the serious disadvantage that the range of head motion is severely reduced. Recently, decompression of the atlantoaxial portions of the affected VA has been used because it does not limit physiological neck movements. However, no long-term follow-up review of patients who have undergone this procedure has been conducted, and it is unclear whether this procedure always provides relief of symptoms. To answer this question, the results of C1-2 posterior fusion were compared with decompression of the VA for the treatment of bow hunter's stroke.
Teleost fishes are the largest and most diverse group of vertebrates. The diversity of teleosts has been attributed to a whole-genome duplication (WGD) event in the ray-finned fish lineage. Recent comparative genomic studies have revealed that teleost genomes have experienced frequent gene-linkage disruptions compared to other vertebrates, and that protein-coding sequences in teleosts are evolving faster than in mammals, irrespective of their duplication status. A significant number of conserved noncoding elements (CNEs) shared between cartilaginous fishes and tetrapods have diverged beyond recognition in teleost fishes. The divergence of CNEs seems to have been initiated in basal ray-finned fishes before the WGD. The fast evolving singleton and duplicated genes as well as the divergent CNEs might have contributed to the diversity of teleost fishes.
Recently it has been shown that most cases of the Miller-Dieker syndrome (MDS) are caused by deletion 17p13.3. All familial cases have been associated with a balanced reciprocal translocation in a carrier parent and unbalanced translocations in their affected offspring. We report a new case of familial MDS in whom the mother carries a pericentric inversion of chromosome 17. She has had two children with MDS, one of whom was shown to carry a recombinant 17 consisting of dup(17q) and del(17p). The high frequency of familial MDS and its consistent association with balanced chromosomal rearrangements in one of the parents makes it important to do high-resolution chromosome analysis on all patients with MDS and possibly all patients with lissencephaly. Finding a familial balanced rearrangement makes prenatal diagnosis of this condition feasible.
Pacritinib (SB1518) is a Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), JAK2(V617F), and Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 inhibitor that does not inhibit JAK1. It demonstrated a favorable safety profile with promising efficacy in phase 1 studies in patients with primary and secondary myelofibrosis (MF). This multicenter phase 2 study further characterized the safety and efficacy of pacritinib in the treatment of patients with MF. Eligible patients had clinical splenomegaly poorly controlled with standard therapies or were newly diagnosed with intermediate- or high-risk Lille score. Patients with any degree of cytopenia were eligible. Thirty-five patients were enrolled. At entry, 40% had hemoglobin <10 g/dL and 43% had platelets <100 000× 10(9)/L. Up to week 24, 8 of 26 evaluable patients (31%) achieved a ≥35% decrease in spleen volume determined by magnetic resonance imaging and 14 of 33 (42%) attained a ≥50% reduction in spleen size by physical examination. Median MF symptom improvement was ≥50% for all symptoms except fatigue. Grade 1 or 2 diarrhea (69%) and nausea (49%) were the most common treatment-emergent adverse events. The study drug was discontinued in 9 patients (26%) due to adverse events (4 severe). Pacritinib is an active agent in patients with MF, offering a potential treatment option for patients with preexisting anemia and thrombocytopenia. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT00745550.
Quality control mechanisms in the endoplasmic reticulum prevent deployment of aberrant or unwanted proteins to distal destinations and target them to degradation by a process known as endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation, or ERAD. Attempts to characterize ERAD by identifying a specific component have revealed that the most general characteristic of ERAD is that the protein substrates are initially translocated to the ER and eventually eliminated in the cytosol by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Hence, dislocation from the ER back to the cytosol is a hallmark in ERAD and p97/Cdc48p, a cytosolic AAA-ATPase that is essential for ERAD, appears to provide the driving force for this process. Moreover, unlike many ERAD components that participate in degradation of either lumenal or membrane substrates, p97/Cdc48p has a more general role in that it is required for ERAD of both types of substrates. Although p97/Cdc48p is not dedicated exclusively to ERAD, its ability to physically associate with ERAD substrates, with VIMP and with the E3 gp78 suggest that the p97/Cdc48Ufdl/Npl4 complex acts as a coordinator that maintains coupling between the different steps in ERAD.
While the health of the general population is not adversely affected by the exposure the pesticides in food and environment, workers, who have during their occupation been intensely exposed to pesticides, exhibit a higher prevalence of slight neurotoxic symptoms. In the present study the electroencephalograms of 3 of a group 10 workmen, who had been continually exposed to hexachlorcyclohexane, show pathological findings. The electromyograms of 8 of these 10 workman demonstrate a disturbance of the peripherical motoneuron. All probands, who exhibit o pathological EEG, also show a polyneuropathy.
Studies on oocyte transcriptome are important to understand the biological pathways involved in oogenesis, totipotence and early embryonic development. Moreover, genes regulating physiological pathways in gametes could represent potential candidates for reproductive disorders. In addition to oocyte specific transcription factors, also the members of the p53 family could be etiologically involved due to their biological functions. In fact, their role in the control of cell cycle, apoptosis, and germ-line genome stability is well known. Female reproductive aging is one of the causes of fertility reduction and it is often associated with egg aneuploidy increase. In order to verify the potential involvement of p73 in reproductive aging, we determined its expression in single mature MII oocytes from two groups of women, younger than 35 or older than 38 years, respectively. We found that TAp73 isoforms are down regulated in oocytes from women older than 38 years. We confirmed these data in pools of mouse oocytes. TAp73 down regulation in oocytes from women of advanced reproductive age could explain both the reduction of fertility and the increase of newborns with chromosomal abnormalities.
An oral fixed combination of netupitant/palonosetron (NEPA; Akynzeo(®)) is available for use in the prevention of acute and delayed chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV). Netupitant is a highly selective neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist and palonosetron is a serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist with a distinct pharmacological profile. Complete response rates during the delayed, acute and overall phases were significantly higher with single-dose netupitant 300 mg plus palonosetron 0.5 mg than with single-dose palonosetron 0.5 mg in cycle 1 of cisplatin-based highly emetogenic chemotherapy (HEC) in a phase II trial and with single-dose netupitant/palonosetron 300/0.5 mg than with single-dose palonosetron 0.5 mg in cycle 1 of anthracycline-cyclophosphamide (AC) moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (MEC) in a phase III trial; the greater efficacy of netupitant/palonosetron was maintained over repeated cycles of AC MEC in the phase III trial. In another phase III trial, netupitant/palonosetron 300/0.5 mg was effective over repeated cycles of non-AC MEC or HEC. Netupitant/palonosetron was well tolerated, with no cardiac safety concerns. The convenience of administering netupitant/palonosetron as a single dose in a fixed combination has the potential to improve adherence to CINV prevention guidelines. In conclusion, netupitant/palonosetron is an important option to consider in the prevention of acute and delayed CINV in patients receiving MEC or HEC.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the flare rate and the change in Safety of Estrogens in Lupus Erythematosus: National Assessment Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SELENA SLEDAI) score with disease flare in pediatric systemic lupus erythematosus (pSLE).METHODS: A retrospective chart review of 62 patients with pSLE (ages 5-20 yrs). A flare was defined as the start of, or increase in, the dose of corticosteroids and/or the addition of an immunosuppressive medication. All pre-flare, flare, and post-flare visits were recorded with a SELENA SLEDAI score calculated for each visit. The flare rate was calculated by dividing the total number of flares in the cohort by the total followup years.RESULTS: Sixty-two patients were eligible. Forty-seven patients had 112 flares. The average number of flares/patient was 1.8 +/- 2.0 and the mean inter-flare time was 15.4 +/- 17.9 months. The flare rate in pSLE was 0.46 flares/patient-year of followup. The median time to first flare from the date of diagnosis was 14.3 months. Patients with cytopenia, pleuritis, or pericarditis, or a positive antibody to Smith nuclear antigen at the time of diagnosis had a significantly higher flare rate than those who did not. The average SELENA SLEDAI score at presentation was 12.5 +/- 5.4, at the pre-flare visit 6.3 +/- 3.5, and during a flare 7.9 +/- 5.1.CONCLUSION: This is the first large study to report a flare rate (0.46 flares/patient-year of followup) in pSLE. The flare rate was similar to what has been reported in pSLE previously but significantly lower than that reported in adults with lupus. The average change in the SELENA SLEDAI score with disease flare is 2 points.
Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a pluripotent hematopoietic disorder that is currently considered incurable. The tyrosine kinase product of the Philadelphia chromosome, P210 BCR-ABL, provided a pathogenetic explanation for the initiation of the CML chronic phase and is the molecular therapeutic target for the disease. Imatinib mesylate, an orally available BCR-ABL kinase inhibitor, can induce haematologic and cytogenetic remission of CML. However, imatinib resistance occurs frequently, resulting in relapse. New treatment strategies are focusing on resistant CML stem cells and the bone marrow stroma. The identification of novel pathways and mechanisms in the bone marrow microenvironment could significantly contribute to the development of such strategies. In this work, we used a high-resolution label-free MS(E) proteomic approach to identify differential protein expression in the CML bone marrow plasma of responsive and resistant patients. Oxidative lipid metabolism and regulation of the switch from canonical to noncanonical WNT signaling may contribute to CML resistance in the bone marrow compartment.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the value of a panel fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in the detection of common chromosome abnormalities in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).METHODS: Twenty cases of MDS patients, whose karyotypes were unknown by the FISH examiner beforehand, were analyzed with a panel FISH using YAC248F5 (5q31), YAC938G5 (7q32), CEP8 and YAC 912C3 (20q12) probes to detect the frequently occurring chromosome abnormalities (-5/5q, -/7q-, +8, 20q-) in MDS. Then the results were compared to those of conventional cytogenetics (CC).RESULTS: Among 20 cases, 13 cases were found to carry common chromosome abnormalities by panel FISH (trisomy 8, five cases; -5/5q-, one case; 20q-, five cases; 5q- accompanying 20q-, one case; complex abnormalities, one case). However, on CC examination, only five cases were found to have common chromosomal abnormalities (20q-, four cases; 5q- accompanying 20q-, one case). In addition, trisomy 21, marker chromosome and complex abnormalities comprising -5, -7 and marker chromosomes were seen in one case each, the rest were normal.CONCLUSION: Panel FISH is a useful tool of molecular cytogenetics in the detection of common chromosome abnormalities in MDS.
The pathophysiology of achalasia is largely unknown, and involves the destruction of ganglion cell in the esophageal myenteric plexus. High-resolution esophageal manometry is the key investigation. Endoscopic pneumodilatation and laparoscopic Heller myotomy have comparable short-term success rates, around 90%. The main complication after pneumodilatation is esophageal perforation, occurring in about 1% of cases. Peroral endoscopic myotomy is a promising treatment modality, however with frequent post-procedural gastroesophageal reflux.
The eukaryotic complexity involves the expression and regulation of genes via RNA-DNA, RNA-RNA, DNA-protein and RNA-protein interactions. Recently, the role of RNA molecules in the regulation of genes in higher organisms has become more evident, especially with the discovery that about 97% of the transcriptional output in higher organisms are represented as noncoding RNAs: rRNA, snoRNAs, tRNA, transposable elements, 5' and 3' untranslated regions, introns, intergenic regions and microRNAs. MicroRNAs function by negatively regulating gene expression via degradation or translational inhibition of their target mRNAs and thus participate in a wide variety of physiological and pathological cellular processes including: development, cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis pathways. MicroRNA expression profiles in many types of cancers have been identified. Recent reports have revealed that the expression profiles of microRNAs change in various human cancers and appear to function as oncogenes or tumor suppressors. Abnormal microRNA expression has increasingly become a common feature of human cancers. In this review, we summarize the latest progress on the involvement of microRNAs in different types of cancer and their potential use as potential diagnostic and prognostic tumor biomarkers in the future.
Cell competition is a social cellular phenomenon in which unfit cells are selectively eliminated to maintain tissue homeostasis.1-3 Recent studies have revealed that mechanical forces induce competitive cell-cell interactions in Drosophila.4-6 This mechanical cell competition has also been reported to play an important role in mammalian cells, using Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells depleted of a polarity regulator Scribble in a tetracycline-inducible manner (scribKD cells).7scribKD cells are hypersensitive to crowding due to the lower homeostatic density than wild-type (WT) cells,7,8 and in the context of cell competition, scribKD cells are compacted and eliminated by WT cells.7-10 Although p38 and p53 are involved in this process,7,10 the molecular mechanism by which WT cells recognize and mechanically eliminate scribKD cells remains unclear. Here, we report that scribKD cells secrete fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) to drive cell competition. Knockdown of FGF21 in scribKD cells or loss of FGFR1 in WT cells suppresses cell competition, suggesting that WT cells recognize scribKD cells through FGF21. FGF21-containing culture medium of scribKD cells activates cell motility. Moreover, FGF21 promotes the compression and elimination of scribKD cells by attracting surrounding WT cells. We also demonstrate that activation of the apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1)-p38 pathway in scribKD cells induces FGF21 to drive cell competition. Our findings reveal a mechanism whereby WT cells mechanically eliminate scribKD cells and propose a new function for FGF21 in cell-cell communication.
An intraoperative remote afterloading endocurietherapy technique with high-activity 60Co for the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme is described. The technique can be used for initial management of the unresectable tumor or for retreatment of patients with recurrent tumor who have been treated previously with surgery and postoperative radiotherapy. Neither intraoperative nor postoperative complications were encountered in our treatment of 11 patients in this Phase I toxicity study.
Senescent and damaged mitochondria undergo selective mitophagic elimination through mechanisms requiring two Parkinson's disease factors, the mitochondrial kinase PINK1 (PTEN-induced putative kinase protein 1; PTEN is phosphatase and tensin homolog) and the cytosolic ubiquitin ligase Parkin. The nature of the PINK-Parkin interaction and the identity of key factors directing Parkin to damaged mitochondria are unknown. We show that the mitochondrial outer membrane guanosine triphosphatase mitofusin (Mfn) 2 mediates Parkin recruitment to damaged mitochondria. Parkin bound to Mfn2 in a PINK1-dependent manner; PINK1 phosphorylated Mfn2 and promoted its Parkin-mediated ubiqitination. Ablation of Mfn2 in mouse cardiac myocytes prevented depolarization-induced translocation of Parkin to the mitochondria and suppressed mitophagy. Accumulation of morphologically and functionally abnormal mitochondria induced respiratory dysfunction in Mfn2-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts and cardiomyocytes and in Parkin-deficient Drosophila heart tubes, causing dilated cardiomyopathy. Thus, Mfn2 functions as a mitochondrial receptor for Parkin and is required for quality control of cardiac mitochondria.
OBJECT: The h index is a recently developed bibliometric that assesses an investigator's scientific impact with a single number. It has rapidly gained popularity in the physical and, more recently, medical sciences.METHODS: The h index for all 1120 academic neurosurgeons working at all Electronic Residency Application Service-listed training programs was determined by reference to Google Scholar. A random subset of 100 individuals was investigated in PubMed to determine the total number of publications produced.RESULTS: The median h index was 9 (range 0-68), with the 75th, 90th, and 95th percentiles being 17, 26, and 36, respectively. The h indices increased significantly with increasing academic rank, with the median for instructors, assistant professors, associate professors, and professors being 2, 5, 10, and 19, respectively (p < 0.0001, Kruskal-Wallis; all groups significantly different from each other except the difference between instructor and assistant professor [Conover]). Departmental chairs had a median h index of 22 (range 3-55) and program directors a median of 17 (range 0-62). Plot of the log of the rank versus h index demonstrated a remarkable linear pattern (R(2) = 0.995, p < 0.0001), suggesting that this is a power-law relationship.CONCLUSIONS: A survey of the h index for all of academic neurosurgery is presented. Results can be used for benchmark purposes. The distribution of the h index within an academic population is described for the first time and appears related to the ubiquitous power-law distribution.
Bone degradation by osteoclasts depends on the formation of a sealing zone, composed of an interlinked network of podosomes, which delimits the degradation lacuna into which osteoclasts secrete acid and proteolytic enzymes. For resorption to occur, the sealing zone must be coherent and stable for extended periods of time. Using titanium roughness gradients ranging from 1 to 4.5 µm R(a) as substrates for osteoclast adhesion, we show that microtopographic obstacles of a length scale well beyond the range of the 'footprint' of an individual podosome can slow down sealing-zone expansion. A clear inverse correlation was found between ring stability, structural integrity and sealing-zone translocation rate. Direct live-cell microscopy indicated that the expansion of the sealing zone is locally arrested by steep, three-dimensional 'ridge-like barriers', running parallel to its perimeter. It was, however, also evident that the sealing zone can bypass such obstacles, if pulled by neighbouring regions, extending through flanking, obstacle-free areas. We propose that sealing-zone dynamics, while being locally regulated by surface roughness, are globally integrated via the associated actin cytoskeleton. The effect of substrate roughness on osteoclast behaviour is significant in relation to osteoclast function under physiological and pathological conditions, and may constitute an important consideration in the design of advanced bone replacements.
Recently developed molecular prognostic tests in patients with early Binet stage chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) are costly and often require a high level of technologic expertise. Recent data give evidence for the prognostic relevance of the percentage of smudge cells in B-CLL. In our study we analysed the prognostic potential of this novel marker in a cohort of 100 CLL patients. The percentage of smudge cells ranged from 0% to 70% (median 21%). Patients with <or=20% smudge cells (according to ROC analysis) had a significantly shorter time to first treatment and overall survival than patients with >20% smudge cells. Multivariate Cox regression analysis identified percentages of smudge cells, stage according to Binet and CD38 expression as independent prognostic markers. The percentage of smudge cells was significantly lower in CD38+, ZAP-70+ and unmutated IgVH patients. Combined analysis of smudge cell percentages with CD38 expression provided complementary prognostic information identifying three patient subgroups with good, intermediate and poor prognosis. Comparing gene expression profiles in a subset of 12 patients we identified eight differentially expressed genes in groups with high vs. low percentage of smudge cells suggesting a role of these differentially expressed genes, especially for Tribbles homolog 2 (Trib2), in the disease progression of high risk CLL patients. In conclusion, our data confirm previous studies showing that the simple and inexpensive microscopic detection of smudge cells on blood smears prepared for routine diagnostic purposes is a novel independent factor predicting overall survival in CLL.
Cisplatin is currently used in tumor chemotherapy to induce the death of malignant cells through blockage of DNA replication. It is a commonly used chemotherapeutic agent binding mono- or bifunctionally to guanines in DNA. Escherichia coli K12 mutant strains deficient in nucleotide excision repair (NER) were submitted to increasing concentrations of cisplatin, and the results revealed that uvrA and uvrB mutants are sensitive to this agent, while uvrC and cho mutants remain as the wild type strain. The time required for both gene expression turn-off and return to normal weight DNA in wild-type E. coli was not accomplished even after 4 h post-treatment with cisplatin, while the same process takes place within 1.5 h after ultraviolet radiation (UV). Besides, a heavily damaging action of cisplatin can be seen not only by persistent nicks on genomic DNA, but also by NER gene expression exceeding manifold that seen after equivalent lethal doses of UV. Moreover, cisplatin caused an increase in uvrB gene expression from its putative upstream promoter P3 in an SOS-independent manner.
The arrangement of nucleosomes in chromatin plays a role in transcriptional regulation by restricting the accessibility of transcription factors and RNA polymerase II to cis-acting elements and promoters. For gene activation, the chromatin structure is altered to an open configuration. The mechanism for this process has been extensively analyzed. However, the mechanism by which repressive chromatin is reconstituted to terminate transcription has not been fully elucidated. Here, we investigated the mechanisms by which chromatin is reconstituted in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombefbp1 gene, which is robustly induced upon glucose starvation but tightly repressed under glucose-rich conditions. We found that the chromatin structure in the region upstream from fbp1 is closed by a two-step process. When cells are returned to glucose-rich medium following glucose starvation, changes in the nucleosome pattern alter the chromatin configuration at the transcription factor binding site to an inaccessible state, after which the nucleosome density upstream from fbp1 gradually increases via histone loading. Interestingly, this histone loading was observed in the absence of the Tup family corepressors Tup11 and Tup12. Analysis of strains carrying either gene disruptions or mutations affecting nine fission yeast histone chaperone genes demonstrated that the histone chaperone Asf1 induces nucleosome loading during glucose repression. These data establish a previously unappreciated chromatin reconstitution mechanism in fbp1 repression.
In cancer research, background models for mutation rates have been extensively calibrated in coding regions, leading to the identification of many driver genes, recurrently mutated more than expected. Noncoding regions are also associated with disease; however, background models for them have not been investigated in as much detail. This is partially due to limited noncoding functional annotation. Also, great mutation heterogeneity and potential correlations between neighboring sites give rise to substantial overdispersion in mutation count, resulting in problematic background rate estimation. Here, we address these issues with a new computational framework called LARVA. It integrates variants with a comprehensive set of noncoding functional elements, modeling the mutation counts of the elements with a β-binomial distribution to handle overdispersion. LARVA, moreover, uses regional genomic features such as replication timing to better estimate local mutation rates and mutational hotspots. We demonstrate LARVA's effectiveness on 760 whole-genome tumor sequences, showing that it identifies well-known noncoding drivers, such as mutations in the TERT promoter. Furthermore, LARVA highlights several novel highly mutated regulatory sites that could potentially be noncoding drivers. We make LARVA available as a software tool and release our highly mutated annotations as an online resource (larva.gersteinlab.org).
The nuclear lamina consists of a proteinaceous layer or meshwork situated subjacent to the inner nuclear membrane. It is a karyoskeletal structure formed by a polymer containing one to three major polypeptides collectively termed the lamins. In all cells examined of vertebrates and invertebrates, the lamins exhibit very similar Mr ranging from 60 000 to 80 000. In vertebrates, two groups of lamins can be distinguished by their isoelectric value, one being near-neutral and the other acidic (isoelectric pH values of 5.6 and lower). The lamins represent a family of polypeptides with regions highly conserved during evolution. In certain species, e.g., the amphibian, Xenopus laevis, they exhibit cell type-specific expression during embryonic development, terminal differentiation of certain somatic cells, and gametogenesis. The nuclear lamina of diverse cell types can be composed of one, two or three different lamin polypeptides, without obvious differences in its morphology.
We present an autosomal-recessive frontonasal dysplasia (FND) characterized by bilateral extreme microphthalmia, bilateral oblique facial cleft, complete cleft palate, hypertelorism, wide nasal bridge with hypoplasia of the ala nasi, and low-set, posteriorly rotated ears in two distinct families. Using Affymetrix 250K SNP array genotyping and homozygosity mapping, we mapped this clinical entity to chromosome 12q21. In one of the families, three siblings were affected, and CNV analysis of the critical region showed a homozygous 3.7 Mb deletion containing the ALX1 (CART1) gene, which encodes the aristaless-like homeobox 1 transcription factor. In the second family we identified a homozygous donor-splice-site mutation (c.531+1G > A) in the ALX1 gene, providing evidence that complete loss of function of ALX1 protein causes severe disruption of early craniofacial development. Unlike loss of its murine ortholog, loss of human ALX1 does not result in neural-tube defects; however, it does severely affect the orchestrated fusion between frontonasal, nasomedial, nasolateral, and maxillary processes during early-stage embryogenesis. This study further expands the spectrum of the recently recognized autosomal-recessive ALX-related FND phenotype in humans.
BACKGROUND: Four nonvitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are approved for the prevention of stroke in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and for the treatment of venous thromboembolism. These include the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran and the direct factor Xa inhibitors rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban. Bleeding is a complication for all anticoagulants and concerns regarding bleeding risk and the suitability of effective reversal strategies may be a barrier to their prescription. Despite the reduced risk of bleeding compared with vitamin K antagonists, questions persist regarding the management of bleeding related to NOAC use.MAIN TEXT: To date, although a number of assays are responsive to NOACs, no single routine laboratory test has been identified to accurately measure the clinical anticoagulation state of patients on NOACs or established as a reliable predictor of bleeding risk. In addition, the establishment of a reliable human bleeding model to test novel inhibitors of the coagulation cascade has proved challenging. Although routine monitoring of anticoagulant levels is not necessary in patients taking NOACs, anticoagulant reversal and a means of measuring reversal may be required for patients who present with bleeding or require urgent surgery. Prothrombin complex concentrates are pooled plasma products containing varying amounts of inactive vitamin K-dependent clotting factors in addition to vitamin K-dependent proteins and can replenish factors in the intrinsic and extrinsic coagulation cascade, reversing an anticoagulant effect. Only one agent, idarucizumab, has been approved for rapid reversal of dabigatran-induced anticoagulation and one more agent, andexanet alfa, has been submitted for approval to reverse the anticoagulatory effects of direct and indirect factor Xa inhibitors.CONCLUSIONS: This review discusses the laboratory tests available for assessing anticoagulation, human models of bleeding, and the use of current strategies-including prothrombin complex concentrates for reversal of anticoagulation by NOACs-to manage bleeding in patients.
We analyzed data from 388 subjects with Fanconi anemia reported to the International Fanconi Anemia Registry (IFAR). Of those, 332 developed hematologic abnormalities at a median age of 7 years (range, birth to 31 years). Actuarial risk of developing hematopoietic abnormalities was 98% (95% confidence interval, 93% to 99%) by 40 years of age. Common hematologic abnormalities were thrombocytopenia and pancytopenia. These were often associated with decreased bone marrow (BM) cellularity (75% of cases studied). Clonal cytogenetic abnormalities developed in 23 of 68 persons with BM failure who had adequate studies. Actuarial risk of clonal cytogenetic abnormalities during BM failure was 67% (47% to 87%) by 30 years of age. Fifty-nine subjects developed myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Actuarial risk of MDS or AML was 52% (37% to 67%) by 40 years of age. Risk was higher in persons with than in those without a prior clonal cytogenetic abnormality (3% [0% to 9%] v 35% [0% to 79%]; P = .006). One hundred twenty persons died of hematologic causes including BM failure, MDS or AML and treatment related complications. Actuarial risk of death from hematologic causes was 81% (67% to 90%) by 40 years of age.
BACKGROUND: Hepatic hemorrhage occurs in less than 5% of patients with hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets (HELLP) syndrome but it is a profound cause of maternal/perinatal morbidity and mortality.OBJECTIVES: To determine when liver bleeding occurs during the development of HELLP syndrome.SEARCH STRATEGY: The English literature was searched for all reports of HELLP syndrome associated with liver bleeding.SELECTION CRITERIA: Eighty-seven case summaries of liver bleeding in the setting of HELLP syndrome were included. The standard definition of HELLP syndrome was used with expansion into the Mississippi classification system, supplemented by patients with partial HELLP syndrome.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Demographic and clinical data were collected and recorded in an Excel database.MAIN RESULTS: Liver bleeding was detected in 18 (20.7%) patients with class 1 HELLP syndrome, 24 (27.6%) with class 2 HELLP syndrome, and 12 (13.8%) with class 3 or partial HELLP syndrome. In 33 (37.9%) patients, the exact class of HELLP syndrome at the time liver bleeding was detected could not be determined from the published descriptions.CONCLUSIONS: Liver bleeding can occur early during HELLP syndrome development, not only in patients with advanced, class 1 illness.
The three p53 family members, p53, p63 and p73, are structurally similar and share many biochemical activities. Yet, along with their common fundamental role in protecting genomic fidelity, each has acquired distinct functions related to diverse cell autonomous and non-autonomous processes. Similar to the p53 family, the Hippo signaling pathway impacts a multitude of cellular processes, spanning from cell cycle and metabolism to development and tumor suppression. The core Hippo module consists of the tumor-suppressive MST-LATS kinases and oncogenic transcriptional co-effectors YAP and TAZ. A wealth of accumulated data suggests a complex and delicate regulatory network connecting the p53 and Hippo pathways, in a highly context-specific manner. This generates multiple layers of interaction, ranging from interdependent and collaborative signaling to apparent antagonistic activity. Furthermore, genetic and epigenetic alterations can disrupt this homeostatic network, paving the way to genomic instability and cancer. This strengthens the need to better understand the nuances that control the molecular function of each component and the cross-talk between the different components. Here, we review interactions between the p53 and Hippo pathways within a subset of physiological contexts, focusing on normal stem cells and development, as well as regulation of apoptosis, senescence and metabolism in transformed cells.
Recent years have seen an explosion of research into increasingly prevalent neurodegenerative diseases. Arimoclomol (BRX-220), being developed by CytRx Corp, is an oral therapeutic candidate for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), the most common form of motor neuron disease. ALS is a fatal, incurable disorder, which can present as sporadic (90 to 95% of cases) or familial (5 to 10% of cases) forms. The etiology of sporadic ALS remains unknown and much of the understanding of ALS pathogenesis has been derived through study of its familial forms; in particular, through study of autosomal dominant mutations in the SOD1 (copper/zinc superoxide dismutase) gene, which cause approximately 20% of familial ALS cases. Under conditions of excessive stress, arimoclomol induces amplification of the cytoprotective heat shock response in order to protect motor neurons from death. Comprehensive in vivo and in vitro studies demonstrated its effect in the prevention of neuronal loss and promotion of motor neuron survival, even after symptom onset. Clinical trials have reported good tolerability and safety. This paper discusses the rationale for arimoclomol use in ALS, the preclinical and clinical evidence collected to date, the likelihood of its promising preclinical results translating to humans, and the relevance of this research for neurodegeneration as a whole.
A 15-year-old, woman, Crohn's disease patient, who carried the TPMT *3C heterozygous mutant, complained of alopecia 3 days after starting 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) and then developed severe myelosuppression 6 weeks after starting 6-MP. The alopecia involved scalp hair only (body hair preserved) and was dominant in the temporal region. Following these side effects, transient remission of Crohn's disease occurred. Myelosuppression due to 6-MP is a rare but life-threatening side effect that is difficult to predict despite continuous monitoring of complete blood cell counts. In the present case, 6-MP-induced alopecia preceded myelosuppression and progressed rapidly as the myelosuppression worsened.
miRNAs and DNA methylation are both critical regulators of gene expression. Aberration in miRNA expression or DNA methylation is a causal factor for numerous pathological conditions. DNA methylation can inhibit the transcription of miRNAs, just like coding genes, by methylating the CpG islands in the promoter regions of miRNAs. Conversely, certain miRNAs can directly target DNA methyltransferases and bring about their inhibition, thereby affecting the whole genome methylation pattern. Recently, methylation patterns have also been revealed in mRNA. Surprisingly, the two most commonly studied methylation states in mRNA (m6A and m5C) are found to be enriched in 3'-UTRs (untranslated regions), the target site for the majority of miRNAs. Whereas m5C is reported to stabilise mRNA, m6A has a destabilising effect on mRNA. However, the effect of mRNA methylation on its interaction with miRNAs is largely unexplored. The review highlights the complex interplay between microRNA and methylation at DNA and mRNA level.
Over the last decade, it has become increasingly clear that the cardiovascular and renal systems are interdependent. Primary disorders of either system have been shown to disturb the other system. As a result, a class of cardiorenal syndrome (CRS) has been identified where in a vicious cycle is established in which acute/chronic dysfunction of either the kidney or the heart exacerbates the loss of function in the other organ. The ADQI organization has proposed a classification derived from a consensus conference held in 2008. CRS is classified as a disorder of the heart and kidneys whereby acute or chronic dysfunction in one organ may induce acute or chronic dysfunction in the other. The general definition has been expanded into five subtypes: CRS type 1 = acute worsening of heart function (acute heart failure-acute coronary syndrome) leading to kidney injury and/or dysfunction; CRS type 2 = chronic abnormalities in heart function (chronic heart failure-chronic heart disease) leading to kidney injury or dysfunction; CRS type 3 = acute worsening of kidney function (acute kidney injury) leading to heart injury and/or dysfunction; CRS type 4 = chronic kidney disease (chronic kidney disease) leading to heart injury, disease and/or dysfunction; and CRS type 5 = systemic conditions leading to simultaneous injury and/or dysfunction of heart and kidney. A major problem with previous terminology was that it did not allow for identification of pathophysiological interactions occurring in the different types of combined heart/kidney disorders. The subdivision into different subtypes seems to provide a better approach to this syndrome.
The ubiquitous tandem kinase JIL-1 is essential for Drosophila development. Its role in defining decondensed domains of larval polytene chromosomes is well established, but its involvement in transcription regulation has remained controversial. For a first comprehensive molecular characterisation of JIL-1, we generated a high-resolution, chromosome-wide interaction profile of the kinase in Drosophila cells and determined its role in transcription. JIL-1 binds active genes along their entire length. The presence of the kinase is not proportional to average transcription levels or polymerase density. Comparison of JIL-1 association with elongating RNA polymerase and a variety of histone modifications suggests two distinct targeting principles. A basal level of JIL-1 binding can be defined that correlates best with the methylation of histone H3 at lysine 36, a mark that is placed co-transcriptionally. The additional acetylation of H4K16 defines a second state characterised by approximately twofold elevated JIL-1 levels, which is particularly prominent on the dosage-compensated male X chromosome. Phosphorylation of the histone H3 N-terminus by JIL-1 in vitro is compatible with other tail modifications. In vivo, phosphorylation of H3 at serine 10, together with acetylation at lysine 14, creates a composite histone mark that is enriched at JIL-1 binding regions. Its depletion by RNA interference leads to a modest, but significant, decrease of transcription from the male X chromosome. Collectively, the results suggest that JIL-1 participates in a complex histone modification network that characterises active, decondensed chromatin. We hypothesise that one specific role of JIL-1 may be to reinforce, rather than to establish, the status of active chromatin through the phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10.
The beta-clip fold includes a diverse group of protein domains that are unified by the presence of two characteristic waist-like constrictions, which bound a central extended region. Members of this fold include enzymes like deoxyuridine triphosphatase and the SET methylase, carbohydrate-binding domains like the fish antifreeze proteins/Sialate synthase C-terminal domains, and functionally enigmatic accessory subunits of urease and molybdopterin biosynthesis protein MoeA. In this study, we reconstruct the evolutionary history of this fold using sensitive sequence and structure comparisons methods. Using sequence profile searches, we identified novel versions of the beta-clip fold in the bacterial flagellar chaperone FlgA and the related pilus protein CpaB, the StrU-like dehydrogenases, and the UxaA/GarD-like hexuronate dehydratases (SAF superfamily). We present evidence that these versions of the beta-clip domain, like the related type III anti-freeze proteins and C-terminal domains of sialic acid synthases, are involved in interactions with carbohydrates. We propose that the FlgA and CpaB-like proteins mediate the assembly of bacterial flagella and Flp pili by means of their interactions with the carbohydrate moieties of peptidoglycan. The N-terminal beta-clip domain of the hexuronate dehydratases appears to have evolved a novel metal-binding site, while their C-terminal domain is likely to adopt a metal-binding TIM barrel-like fold. Using structural comparisons, we show that the beta-clip fold can be further classified into two major groups, one that includes the SAF, SET, dUTPase superfamilies, and the other that includes the phage lambda head decoration protein, the beta subunit of urease and the C-terminal domain of the molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis protein MoeA. Structural comparisons also suggest the beta-clip fold was assembled through the duplication of a three-stranded unit. Though the three-stranded units are likely to have had a common origin, we present evidence that complete beta-clip domains were assembled through such duplications, independently on multiple occasions. There is also evidence for circular permutation of the basic three-stranded unit on different occasions in the evolution of the beta-clip unit. We also describe how assembly of this fold from a basic three-stranded unit has been utilized to accommodate a variety of activities in its different versions.
Complex diseases are common genetic disorders showing familial aggregation but no typical Mendelian inheritance. Hirschsprung disease (HSCR), a developmental disorder characterized by the absence of enteric neurons in distal segments of the gut, shows a complex pattern of inheritance, with the RET protooncogene acting as a major gene and additional susceptibility loci playing minor roles. In the last years, we have identified a "protective" RET haplotype, which is underrepresented in HSCR patients with respect to controls. Here, we demonstrate that the protective effect of this haplotype is due to a variant located in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of the RET gene, which slows down the physiological mRNA decay of the gene transcripts. Such a functional effect of this common RET variant explains the under-representation of the whole haplotype and its role as a modifying factor in HSCR pathogenesis.
OBJECTIVE: To examine whether the maintenance of elevated magnesium serum concentrations by intravenous administration of magnesium sulfate can reduce the occurrence of cerebral ischemic events after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled study.SETTING: Neurosurgical intensive care unit of a University hospital.INTERVENTIONS: One hundred ten patients were randomized to receive intravenous magnesium sulfate or to serve as controls. Magnesium treatment was started with a bolus of 16 mmol, followed by continuous infusion of 8 mmol/hr. Serum concentrations were measured every 8 hrs, and infusion rates were adjusted to maintain target levels of 2.0-2.5 mmol/L. Intravenous administration was continued for 10 days or until signs of vasospasm had resolved. Thereafter, magnesium was administered orally and tapered over 12 days.MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Delayed ischemic infarction (primary end point) was assessed by analyzing serial computed tomography scans. Transcranial Doppler sonography and digital subtraction angiography were used to detect vasospasm. Delayed ischemic neurologic deficit was determined by continuous detailed neurologic examinations; clinical outcome after 6 months was assessed using the Glasgow outcome scale. Good outcome was defined as Glasgow outcome scale score 4 and 5.The incidence of delayed ischemic infarction was significantly lower in magnesium-treated patients (22% vs. 51%; p = .002); 34 of 54 magnesium patients and 27 of 53 control patients reached good outcome (p = .209). Delayed ischemic neurologic deficit was nonsignificantly reduced (9 of 54 vs. 15 of 53 patients; p = .149) and transcranial Doppler-detected/angiographic vasospasm was significantly reduced in the magnesium group (36 of 54 vs. 45 of 53 patients; p = .028). Fewer patients with signs of vasospasm had delayed cerebral infarction.CONCLUSION: These data indicate that high-dose intravenous magnesium can reduce cerebral ischemic events after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage by attenuating vasospasm and increasing the ischemic tolerance during critical hypoperfusion.
Cell isolation via antibody-targeted magnetic beads is a powerful tool for research and clinical applications, most recently for isolating circulating tumor cells (CTC). Nonetheless fundamental features of the cell-bead interface are still unknown. Here we apply a clinically relevant antibody against the cancer target HER2 (ErbB2) for magnetic cell isolation. We investigate how many target proteins per cell are sufficient for a cell to be isolated. To understand the importance of primary antibody affinity, we compared a series of point mutants with known affinities and show that even starting with subnanomolar affinity, improving antibody affinity improved cell isolation. To test the importance of the connection between the primary antibody and the magnetic bead, we compared bridging the antibody to the beads with Protein L, secondary antibody, or streptavidin: the high-stability streptavidin-biotin linkage improved sensitivity by an order of magnitude. Cytoskeletal polymerization did not have a major effect on cell isolation, but isolation was inhibited by cholesterol depletion and enhanced by cholesterol loading of cells. Analyzing a panel of human cancer cell lines spanning a wide range of expression showed that the standard approach could only isolate the highest expressing cells. However, our optimization of cholesterol level, primary antibody affinity, and antibody-bead linkage allowed efficient and specific isolation of cells expressing low levels of HER2 or epithelial cell adhesion molecule. These insights should guide future approaches to cell isolation, either magnetically or using other means, and extend the range of cellular antigens and biomarkers that can be targeted for CTC isolation in cancer research and diagnosis.
IMPORTANCE: Narrowband UV-B (NB-UV-B) phototherapy is used extensively to treat vitiligo. Afamelanotide, an analogue of α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, is known to induce tanning of the skin.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of combination therapy for generalized vitiligo consisting of afamelanotide implant and NB-UV-B phototherapy.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This study was performed in 2 academic outpatient dermatology centers and 1 private dermatology practice. We enrolled men and women 18 years or older with Fitzpatrick skin phototypes (SPTs) III to VI and a confirmed diagnosis of nonsegmental vitiligo that involved 15% to 50% of total body surface area. Vitiligo was stable or slowly progressive for 3 months. Patients were randomized to combination therapy (n = 28) vs NB-UV-B monotherapy (n = 27). After 1 month of NB-UV-B phototherapy, 16 mg of afamelanotide was administered subcutaneously to the combination therapy group monthly for 4 months while NB-UV-B phototherapy continued; the other group continued to receive NB-UV-B monotherapy.INTERVENTIONS: Narrowband UV-B monotherapy vs combined NB-UV-B phototherapy and afamelanotide.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Response on the Vitiligo Area Scoring Index and Vitiligo European Task Force scoring system.RESULTS: Response in the combination therapy group was superior to that in the NB-UV-B monotherapy group (P < .05) at day 56. For the face and upper extremities, a significantly higher percentage of patients in the combination therapy group achieved repigmentation, and at earlier times (face, 41.0 vs 61.0 days [P = .001]; upper extremities, 46.0 vs 69.0 days [P = .003]). In the combination therapy group, repigmentation was 48.64% (95% CI, 39.49%-57.80%) at day 168 vs 33.26% (95% CI, 24.18%-42.33%) in the NB-UV-B monotherapy group. Notable adverse events included erythema in both groups and minor infections and nausea in the combination therapy group. Comparison between Fitzpatrick SPTs showed patients with SPTs IV to VI in the combination therapy group had improvement in the Vitiligo Area Scoring Index at days 56 and 84 (P < .05); no significant difference was noted in patients with SPT III.CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: A combination of afamelanotide implant and NB-UV-B phototherapy resulted in clinically apparent, statistically significant superior and faster repigmentation compared with NB-UV-B monotherapy. The response was more noticeable in patients with SPTs IV to VI.TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01430195.
We studied the anatomical correlates of reflex hot water epilepsy (HWE) using multimodality investigations viz. magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), electroencephalography (EEG), and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Five men (mean age: 27.0 ΁ 5.8 years) with HWE were subjected to MRI of brain, video-EEG studies, and SPECT scan. These were correlated with phenotypic presentations. Seizures could be precipitated in three patients with pouring of hot water over the head and semiology of seizures was suggestive of temporal lobe epilepsy. Ictal SPECT showed hyperperfusion in: left medial temporal - one, left lateral temporal - one, and right parietal - one. Interictal SPECT was normal in all five patients and did not help in localization. MRI and interictal EEG was normal in all the patients. The clinical and SPECT studies suggested temporal lobe as the seizure onset zone in some of the patients with HWE.
Bilirubin, a major end product of heme breakdown, is an important constituent of bile, responsible for its characteristic colour. Over recent decades, our understanding of bilirubin metabolism has expanded along with the processes of elimination of other endogenous and exogenous anionic substrates, mediated by the action of multiple transport systems at the sinusoidal and canalicular membrane of hepatocytes. Several inherited disorders characterised by impaired bilirubin conjugation (Crigler-Najjar syndrome type I and type II, Gilbert syndrome) or transport (Dubin-Johnson and Rotor syndrome) result in various degrees of hyperbilirubinemia of either the predominantly unconjugated or predominantly conjugated type. Moreover, disrupted regulation of hepatobiliary transport systems can explain jaundice in many acquired liver disorders. In this review, we discuss the recent data on liver bilirubin handling based on the discovery of the molecular basis of Rotor syndrome. The data show that a substantial fraction of bilirubin conjugates is primarily secreted by MRP3 at the sinusoidal membrane into the blood, from where they are subsequently reuptaken by sinusoidal membrane-bound organic anion transporting polypeptides OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. OATP1B proteins are also responsible for liver clearance of bilirubin conjugated in splanchnic organs, such as the intestine and kidney, and for a number of endogenous compounds, xenobiotics and drugs. Absence of one or both OATP1B proteins thus may have serious impact on toxicity of commonly used drugs cleared by this system such as statins, sartans, methotrexate or rifampicin. The liver-blood cycling of conjugated bilirubin is impaired in cholestatic and parenchymal liver diseases and this impairment most likely contributes to jaundice accompanying these disorders.
Accumulating evidence highlights the potential role of mixed proteinopathies (i.e., abnormal protein aggregation) in the development of clinical manifestations of neurodegenerative diseases (NDD). Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited NDD caused by autosomal-dominant expanded CAG trinucleotide repeat mutation in the gene coding for Huntingtin (Htt). Previous studies have suggested the coexistence of phosphorylated-Tau, α-synuclein (α-Syn) and TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) inclusions in HD. However, definite evidence that HD pathology in humans can be accompanied by other proteinopathies is still lacking. Using human post-mortem putamen samples from 31 controls and 56 HD individuals, we performed biochemical analyses of the expression, oligomerization and aggregation of Tau, α-Syn, TDP-43, and Amyloid precursor protein (APP)/Aβ. In HD brain, we observed reduced soluble protein (but not mRNA) levels of Htt, α-Syn, and Tau. Our results also support abnormal phosphorylation of Tau in more advanced stages of disease. Aberrant splicing of Tau exons 2, 3 (exclusion) and 10 (inclusion) was also detected in HD patients, leading to higher 0N4R and lower 1N3R isoforms. Finally, following formic acid extraction, we observed increased aggregation of TDP-43, α-Syn, and phosphorylated-Tau during HD progression. Notably, we observed that 88% of HD patients with Vonsattel grade 4 neuropathology displayed at least one non-Htt proteinopathy compared to 29% in controls. Interestingly, α-Syn aggregation correlated with Htt, TDP-43 and phosphorylated-Tau in HD but not in controls. The impact of this work is twofold: (1) it provides compelling evidences that Tau, α-Syn and TDP-43 proteinopathies are increased in HD, and (2) it suggests the involvement of common mechanisms leading to abnormal accumulation of aggregation-prone proteins in NDD. Further studies will be needed to decipher the impact of these proteinopathies on clinical manifestation of HD.
BACKGROUND: Muscle pain without elevation of serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) (myalgia) is the most common medication-related adverse effect of statin therapy; it occurs in up to 10% of patients who are prescribed statin therapy. Although much is known regarding risk factors for overt myositis, very few studies have provided information on this common form of statin intolerance.METHODS: We defined a detailed clinical and laboratory phenotype of a cohort of patients referred to the lipid clinic of a governmental health maintenance organization for statin intolerance attributable to muscle pain without CPK elevation (myalgia) and characterized their response to alternative lipid-lowering therapy. Baseline and follow-up data were analyzed for 104 patients with statin intolerance attributable to myalgia and 211 statin-tolerant control patients identified from the referral population.RESULTS: Among patients with myalgia, more were white and had hypertension. The prevalence of known risk factors for overt myositis, including renal disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, thyroid disease, and electrolyte abnormalities, did not differ between statin intolerant and statin tolerant patients. Although individual cases were identified in which the addition of interacting medications was temporally associated with development of statin intolerance, overall use of interacting medications was not more frequent among statin-intolerant patients. The majority of patients were intolerant of two or more statins; however, in more than one-half the cases, successful rechallenge with an alternative statin was accomplished. Despite this and extensive use of nonstatin lipid medications after lipid clinic referral, control of plasma lipoproteins remained significantly worse in statin-intolerant patients.CONCLUSIONS: Statin intolerance attributable to myalgia is a significant barrier to effective treatment of hyperlipidemia. Conventional clinical risk factors for myositis do not appear to predictive of statin-associated myalgia. These findings underscore the need to better define the pathophysiology of statin-induced myalgia and develop methodologies to guide treatment of statin-intolerant patients.
Potocki-Lupski syndrome (PTLS; MIM #610883), characterized by neurobehavioral abnormalities, intellectual disability and congenital anomalies, is caused by a 3.7-Mb duplication in 17p11.2. Neurobehavioral studies determined that ∼70-90% of PTLS subjects tested positive for autism or autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We previously chromosomally engineered a mouse model for PTLS (Dp(11)17/+) with a duplication of a 2-Mb genomic interval syntenic to the PTLS region and identified consistent behavioral abnormalities in this mouse model. We now report extensive phenotyping with behavioral assays established to evaluate core and associated autistic-like traits, including tests for social abnormalities, ultrasonic vocalizations, perseverative and stereotypic behaviors, anxiety, learning and memory deficits and motor defects. Alterations were identified in both core and associated ASD-like traits. Rearing this animal model in an enriched environment mitigated some, and even rescued selected, neurobehavioral abnormalities, suggesting a role for gene-environment interactions in the determination of copy number variation-mediated autism severity.
The mechanism of L-DOPA for antinociception was investigated. Nociceptive behaviors in mice after an intrathecal (i.t.) administration of substance P were evaluated. L-DOPA (i.t.) dose-dependently attenuated the substance P-induced nociceptive behaviors. Co-administration of benserazide (i.t.), a DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor, abolished the antinociceptive effect of L-DOPA. The L-DOPA-induced antinociception was antagonized by sulpiride, a D2 blocker, but not by SCH 23390, a D1 blocker. These results suggest that L-DOPA relieves pain after conversion to dopamine, with the dopamine sedating pain transmission by way of the dopamine D2 receptor.
BACKGROUND: Our recent studies suggested that the chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 1-like (CHD1L) gene plays an oncogenic role in human hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the status of CHD1L protein expression in ovarian cancer and its clinical/prognostic significance are obscure.METHODS: In this study, immunohistochemistry (IHC) for CHD1L was performed on a tissue microarray (TMA) containing 102 primary ovarian carcinomas and 44 metastatic lesions (omental metastasis). Receiver-operator curve (ROC) analysis was used to evaluate patients' survival status.RESULTS: There is an augmented tendency of CHD1L expression in ovarian carcinoma metastasis than in primary lesions (P<0.05). A significant association was found between positive expression of CHD1L and tumors histological type (P <0.05). By univariate survival analysis of the ovarian carcinoma cohorts, positive expression of CHD1L was significantly correlated with shortened patient survival (mean 66.7 months versus 97.4 months, P<0.05). Moreover, CHD1L expression was evaluated to be a significant and independent prognostic factor in multivariate analysis (P<0.05).CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide evidence that positive expression of CHD1L protein is significantly correlated with the metastasis proceeding of ovarian carcinoma, and CHD1L protein expression, as examined by IHC, may act as a novel prognostic biomarker for patients with ovarian carcinoma.
Cystic fibrosis is the most common, severe, inherited disease in the Caucasian population. As a consequence, the demand for genetic counselling of patients with cystic fibrosis and their families is large. In Denmark the incidence of cystic fibrosis is 1:4700, which is quite low compared to other European countries. We have investigated 268 Danish cystic fibrosis patients with respect to DNA markers (haplotypes) and the most common mutation delta F508. The delta F508 mutation is found on 88% of all cystic fibrosis chromosomes, the highest frequency reported so far. This had had an important impact on genetic counselling, prenatal diagnosis and eventually population screening. In the Danish population 78% of all couples at risk will be informative for delta F508 and will be identifiable by simple screening methods.
OBJECTIVES: Mutations in the SLC26A4 gene (7q22.3-7q31.1) are considered one of the most common causes of genetic hearing loss. There are two clinical forms related to these mutations: syndromic and non-syndromic deafness. The first one is named Pendred Syndrome (PS) when deafness is associated with thyroid goiter; the second is called DFNB4, when no other symptoms are present. Both are transmitted as an autosomal recessive trait, but simple heterozygotes can develop both forms of deafness. Actually it is thought that Pendred Syndrome occurs when both alleles of SLC26A4 gene are mutated; DFNB4 seems due to monoallelic mutations. PS and DFNB4 can be associated with inner ear malformations. In most of the cases (around 80%), these consist in Enlarged Vestibular Aqueduct (EVA). EVA can also be present without SLC26A4 mutations. Understanding the role of new SLC26A4 variants should facilitate clinical assessment, as well as diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. This investigation aims to detect and report genetic causes of two unrelated Italian boys with hearing loss.METHODS: Patients and family members underwent clinical, audiological and genetic evaluations. To identify genetic mutations, DNA sequencing of SLC26A4 gene (including all 21 exons, exon-intron boundaries and promoter region) was carried out.RESULTS: Both probands were affected by congenital, progressive and fluctuating mixed hearing loss. Temporal bone imaging revealed a bilateral EVA with no other abnormalities in both cases. Probands were heterozygotes for previously undescribed mutations in the SLC26A4 gene: R409H/IVS2+1delG (proband 1) and L236P/K590X (proband 2). No other mutations were detected in GJB2, GJB6 genes or mitochondrial DNA (mit-DNA).CONCLUSIONS: The IVS2+1delG and K590X mutations have not yet been described in literature but there is some evidence to suggest that they have a pathological role. The results underlined the importance of considering the complete DNA sequencing of the SLC26A4 gene for differential molecular diagnosis of deafness, especially in those patients affected by congenital, progressive and fluctuating mixed hearing loss with bilateral EVA.
The ideal cancer treatment would specifically target cancer cells yet have minimal or no adverse effects on normal somatic cells. Telomerase, the ribonucleoprotein reverse transcriptase that maintains the ends of human chromosome, is an attractive cancer therapeutic target for exactly this reason [1]. Telomerase is expressed in more than 85% of cancer cells, making it a nearly universal cancer marker, while the majority of normal somatic cells are telomerase negative. Telomerase activity confers limitless replicative potential to cancer cells, a hallmark of cancer which must be attained for the continued growth that characterizes almost all advanced neoplasms [2]. In this review we will summarize the role of telomeres and telomerase in cancer cells, and how properties of telomerase are being exploited to create targeted cancer therapies including telomerase inhibitors, telomerase-targeted immunotherapies and telomerase-driven virotherapies. A frank and balanced assessment of the current state of telomerase inhibitors with caveats and potential limitations will be included.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between the circadian locomotor output cycles kaput (CLOCK) gene rs1554483 G/C polymorphism and susceptibility to Alzheimer's disease in Chinese people.METHODS: This case-control study determined apolipoprotein E (APOE) and CLOCK rs1554483 G/C genotypes using polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism.RESULTS: Unrelated patients with Alzheimer's disease (n = 130) and healthy controls (n = 188) were analysed for an association between the CLOCK gene rs1554483 G/C polymorphism and susceptibility to Alzheimer's disease. In the whole sample and in APOE ε4 isoform noncarriers, the prevalence of CLOCK gene rs1554483 G allele carriers was significantly higher in patients with Alzheimer's disease than in controls. Among APOE ε4 carriers, the prevalence of CLOCK rs1554483 G allele carriers was not significantly different between patients with Alzheimer's disease and controls.CONCLUSION: Among APOE ε4 noncarriers, but not APOE ε4 carriers, the CLOCK rs1554483 G allele was associated with increased susceptibility to Alzheimer's disease.
Mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) overactivation promotes cardiac fibrosis. We studied the ability of the non-steroidal MR antagonist finerenone to prevent fibrotic remodeling. In neonatal rat cardiac fibroblasts, finerenone prevented aldosterone-induced nuclear MR translocation. Treatment with finerenone decreased the expression of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) (74 ± 15% of control, p = 0.005) and prevented aldosterone-induced upregulation of CTGF and lysyl oxidase (LOX) completely. Finerenone attenuated the upregulation of transforming growth factor ß (TGF-ß), which was induced by the Rac1 GTPase activator l-buthionine sulfoximine. Transgenic mice with cardiac-specific overexpression of Rac1 (RacET) showed increased left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic (63.7 ± 8.0 vs. 93.8 ± 25.6 µl, p = 0.027) and end-systolic (28.0 ± 4.0 vs. 49.5 ± 16.7 µl, p = 0.014) volumes compared to wild-type FVBN control mice. Treatment of RacET mice with 100 ppm finerenone over 5 months prevented LV dilatation. Systolic and diastolic LV function did not differ between the three groups. RacET mice exhibited overactivation of MR and 11ß hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2. Both effects were reduced by finerenone (reduction about 36%, p = 0.030, and 40%, p = 0.032, respectively). RacET mice demonstrated overexpression of TGF-ß, CTGF, LOX, osteopontin as well as collagen and myocardial fibrosis in the left ventricle. In contrast, expression of these parameters did not differ between finerenone-treated RacET and control mice. Finerenone prevented left atrial dilatation (6.4 ± 1.5 vs. 4.7 ± 1.4 mg, p = 0.004) and left atrial fibrosis (17.8 ± 3.1 vs. 12.8 ± 3.1%, p = 0.046) compared to vehicle-treated RacET mice. In summary, finerenone prevented from MR-mediated structural remodeling in cardiac fibroblasts and in RacET mice. These data demonstrate anti-fibrotic myocardial effects of finerenone.
OBJECTIVES: To identify a better set of DNA methylation markers to detect superficial, low grade cancer cell in urine sediment for improving cancer treatment, morbidity, and mortality.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Methylation-specific PCR (MSP) assay was used to detect promoter hypermethylation in 4 genes (E-cadherin, p16, p14, and RASSF1A) to identify reliable biomarkers for bladder cancer diagnosis in primary tumor DNA and urine sediment DNA from 57 bladder cancer patients. Urine DNA was compared with 20 healthy controls.RESULTS: Fifty-one (90%) tumor DNA and 47 urine DNA (83%) samples from bladder cancer patients revealed hypermethylation in at least 1 of the 4 analyzed genes, whereas all urine samples from normal controls were negative. The sensitivity of MSP assay for detecting E-cadherin, p16, p14 and RASSF1A in tumor cells in voided urine was 35%, 35%, 33%, and 65%, respectively. Diagnostic sensitivity was 75% for combining RASSF1A and p14, and 83% for RASSF1A, p14 and E-cadherin. Urine cytology, however, detect only 13 (28%) cases of cancer or suspicious cancer. For detecting superficial and invasive bladder tumor, urine cytology revealed a sensitivity of 23% (6/26) and 35% (7/20), respectively. In contrast, MSP detected hypermethylation in the urine of 80% (37/46) bladder cancer patients. Moreover, hypermethylation analysis of E-cadherin, p14 or RASSF1A genes in urine sediment DNA detected in 85% (22/26) of superficial, 85% (11/13) of low grade, 75% (15/20) of invasive and 79% (26/33) of high grade bladder cancers. Importantly, hypermethylation was detected in the urine DNA of 90% (18/20) superficial tumors with negative or atypia cytology.CONCLUSIONS: Hypermethylation of E-cadherin, p14 or RASSF1A in urine sediment DNA is a potential biomarker for detecting superficial, low grade cancer. Besides, hypermethylation of these 3 genes is a valuable adjunct diagnostic marker to urine cytology, which can enhance the diagnostic accuracy and follow-up treatment of bladder cancer patients.
Despite decades of laboratory research and clinical trials, a safe and effective treatment for traumatic brain injury (TBI) has yet to be put into successful clinical use. I suggest that much of the problem can be attributed to a reductionist perspective and attendant research strategy directed to finding or designing drugs that target a single receptor mechanism, gene, or brain locus. This approach fails to address the complexity of TBI, which leads to a cascade of systemic toxic events in the brain and throughout the body that may persist over long periods of time. Attention is now turning to pleiotropic drugs: drugs that act on multiple genomic, proteomic and metabolic pathways to enhance morphological and functional outcomes after brain injury. Of the various agents now in clinical trials, the neurosteroid progesterone (PROG) is gaining attention despite the widespread assumption that it is "just a female hormone" with limited, if any, neuroprotective properties. This perspective should change. PROG is also a powerful developmental hormone that plays a critical role in protecting the fetus during gestation. I argue here that development, neuroprotection and cellular repair have a number of properties in common. I discuss evidence that PROG is pleiotropically neuroprotective and may be a useful therapeutic and neuroprotective agent for central nervous system injury and some neurodegenerative diseases.
Only a minority of the genes, identified in the Caenorhabditis elegans genome sequence data by computer analysis, have been characterized experimentally. We attempted to determine the expression patterns for a random sample of the annotated genes using reporter gene fusions. A low success rate was obtained for evolutionarily recently duplicated genes. Analysis of the data suggests that this is not due to conditional or low-level expression. The remaining explanation is that most of the annotated genes in the recently duplicated category are pseudogenes, a proportion corresponding to 20% of all of the annotated C. elegans genes. Further support for this surprisingly high figure was sought by comparing sequences for families of recently duplicated C. elegans genes. Although only a preliminary analysis, clear evidence for a gene having been recently inactivated by genetic drift was found for many genes in the recently duplicated category. At least 4% of the annotated C. elegans genes can be recognized as pseudogenes simply from closer inspection of the sequence data. Lessons learned in identifying pseudogenes in C. elegans could be of value in the annotation of the genomes of other species where, although there may be fewer pseudogenes, they may be harder to detect.
Commotio cordis is a recognised cause of sudden death in which an apparently minor blow to the chest causes ventricular fibrillation and cardiac arrest. It is best known for causing death during games of youth baseball in the United States, but individual cases have been recorded as a result of a wide range of activities, principally sporting. The underlying biochemical and mechano-electric causes have been well documented. However, there are few reported cases where commotio cordis is implicated as the cause of death in homicide cases. We present three cases from the north-east of England where an assault caused death by this mechanism.
The transcription factor HIF1 is mostly regulated by the oxygen-dependent proteasomal degradation of the labile subunit HIF1A. Recent data showed degradation of HIF1A in the lysosome through chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA). However the molecular mechanism involved has not been elucidated. This study shows that the KFERQ-like motif, that has been identified in all CMA substrates, is required to mediate the interaction between HIF1A and the chaperone HSPA8. Moreover, mutations in the KFERQ-like motif of HIF1A preclude the interaction with the CMA receptor LAMP2A, thus inhibiting its lysosomal degradation. Importantly, we show for the first time that the ubiquitin ligase STUB1 is required for degradation of HIF1A in the lysosome by CMA. Indeed, mutations in STUB1 that inhibit either the ubiquitin ligase activity or its ability to bind to HSPA8, both prevent degradation of HIF1A by CMA. Moreover, we show that HIF1A binds to and is translocated into intact lysosomes isolated from rat livers. This new pathway for degradation of HIF1A does not depend on the presence of oxygen and is activated in response to nutrient deprivation such that the levels of HIF1A bound to CMA positive lysosomes significantly increase in starved animal livers and the binding of HIF1A to LAMP2A increases in response to serum deprivation. Moreover, excessive degradation of HIF1A by CMA compromises cells' ability to respond to and survive under hypoxia, suggesting that this pathway might be of pathophysiological importance in conditions that combine hypoxia with starvation.
BACKGROUND: A human genetic variant (Ser96Ala) in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) histidine-rich Ca(2+)-binding (HRC) protein has been linked to ventricular arrhythmia and sudden death in dilated cardiomyopathy. However, the precise mechanisms affecting SR function and leading to arrhythmias remain elusive.METHODS AND RESULTS: We generated transgenic mice with cardiac-specific expression of human Ala96 HRC or Ser96 HRC in the null background to assess function in absence of endogenous protein. Ala96 HRC decreased (25% to 30%) cardiomyocyte contractility and Ca2+ kinetics compared with Ser96 HRC in the absence of any structural or histological abnormalities. Furthermore, the frequency of Ca2+ waves was significantly higher (10-fold), although SR Ca2+ load was reduced (by 27%) in Ala96 HRC cells. The underlying mechanisms involved diminished interaction of Ala96 HRC with triadin, affecting ryanodine receptor (RyR) stability. Indeed, the open probability of RyR, assessed by use of ryanodine binding, was significantly increased. Accordingly, stress conditions (5 Hz plus isoproterenol) induced aftercontractions (65% in Ala96 versus 12% in Ser96) and delayed afterdepolarizations (70% in Ala96 versus 20% in Ser96). The increased SR Ca2+ leak was accompanied by hyperphosphorylation (1.6-fold) of RyR at Ser2814 by calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II. Accordingly, inclusion of the calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II inhibitor KN93 prevented Ser2814 phosphorylation and partially reversed the increases in Ca2+ spark frequency and wave production. Parallel in vivo studies revealed ventricular ectopy on short-term isoproterenol challenge and increased (4-fold) propensity to arrhythmias, including nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, after myocardial infarction in Ala96 HRC mice.CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that aberrant SR Ca2+ release and increased susceptibility to delayed afterdepolarizations underlie triggered arrhythmic activity in human Ala96 HRC carriers.
The interferon (IFN)-induced signal transduction and transcription activation complex, ISGF3, is assembled from three proteins, STAT1, STAT2, and IRF9. Of these components, STAT2 provides a fundamental and essential transcriptional activation function for ISGF3. In the present study, we show that ISGF3-mediated transcription is dependent on STAT2 interactions with DRIP150, a subunit of the multimeric Mediator coactivator complex. Other Mediator subunits, DRIP77 and DRIP130, were found either to bind STAT2 without augmenting ISGF3 transcriptional activity or to enhance ISGF3 transcription without binding STAT2, but only DRIP150 both enhanced IFN-dependent transcription and coimmunoprecipitated with STAT2. Endogenous DRIP150 and STAT2 were able to interact in solution, and DNA affinity chromatography and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that DRIP150 binds to the mature, activated ISGF3-DNA complex and is recruited to target gene promoters in an IFN-dependent fashion. IFN-dependent recruitment of DRIP130 to an ISGF3 target promoter and SRB10-STAT2 coprecipitation suggest indirect association with a multisubunit Mediator complex. The site of STAT2 interaction was mapped to DRIP150 residues 188 to 566, which are necessary and sufficient for interaction with STAT2. Expression of this DRIP150 fragment, but not DRIP150 fragments outside the STAT2 interaction region, suppressed ISGF3-mediated transcriptional activity in a dominant-negative fashion, suggesting a direct functional role of this domain in mediating STAT2-DRIP150 interactions. These findings indicate that the IFN-activated ISGF3 transcription factor regulates transcription through contact with DRIP150 and implicate the Mediator coactivator complex in IFN-activated gene regulation.

Granzyme B is known to be a serine protease contained in granules of cytotoxic T cells. We have previously reported an influence of granzyme B expression in T regulatory cells (Tregs) on the risk of acute graft versus host disease (GVHD) onset. However, it is still unknown if conventional T cells (Tcon) use the granzyme B pathway as a mechanism of alloimmunity. We hypothesized that granzyme B in Tcon may affect recurrence within the first 6 months after allogeneic transplantation (allo-HSCT). A total of 65 patients with different hematological malignancies were included in this study. Blood samples were collected on day +30 after allo-HSCT. The percentage of granzyme B positive conventional T cells in patients who developed relapse in the first 6 months after allo-HSCT was 11.3 (4.5-35.3) compared to the others in continuous complete remission-1.3 (3.65-9.7), р = 0.011. The risk of relapse after allo-HSCT was in 3.9 times higher in patients with an increased percentage of granzyme B positive conventional T cells. The findings demonstrated that the percentage of granzyme B positive conventional T cells on day +30 after allo-HSCT could be a predictable marker of relapse within the first 6 months after allo-HSCT.
For a long time, lysosomes were considered merely to be cellular 'incinerators' involved in the degradation and recycling of cellular waste. However, now there is compelling evidence indicating that lysosomes have a much broader function and that they are involved in fundamental processes such as secretion, plasma membrane repair, signalling and energy metabolism. Furthermore, the essential role of lysosomes in autophagic pathways puts these organelles at the crossroads of several cellular processes, with significant implications for health and disease. The identification of a master regulator, transcription factor EB (TFEB), that regulates lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy has revealed how the lysosome adapts to environmental cues, such as starvation, and targeting TFEB may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for modulating lysosomal function in human disease.
Hendra virus is a highly pathogenic paramyxovirus classified as a biosafety level four agent. The fusion (F) protein of Hendra virus is critical for promoting viral entry and cell-to-cell fusion. To be fusogenically active, Hendra virus F must undergo endocytic recycling and cleavage by the endosomal/lysosomal protease cathepsin L, but the route of Hendra virus F following internalization and the recycling signals involved are poorly understood. We examined the intracellular distribution of Hendra virus F following endocytosis and showed that it is primarily present in Rab5- and Rab4-positive endosomal compartments, suggesting that cathepsin L cleavage occurs in early endosomes. Hendra virus F transmembrane domain (TMD) residues S490 and Y498 were found to be important for correct Hendra virus F recycling, with the hydroxyl group of S490 and the aromatic ring of Y498 important for this process. In addition, changes in association of isolated Hendra virus F TMDs correlated with alterations to Hendra virus F recycling, suggesting that appropriate TMD interactions play an important role in endocytic trafficking.
Versaphilic Anaeromyxobacter dehalogenans strains implicated in hexavalent uranium reduction and immobilization are present in the fractured saprolite subsurface environment at the U.S. Department of Energy Integrated Field-Scale Subsurface Research Challenge (IFC) site near Oak Ridge, TN. To provide insight into the in situ distribution of Anaeromyxobacter strains in this system with a nonuniform groundwater flow, 16S rRNA gene-targeted primers and linear hybridization (TaqMan) probes were designed for Oak Ridge IFC Anaeromyxobacter isolates FRC-D1 and FRC-W, along with an Anaeromyxobacter genus-targeted probe and primer set. Multiplex quantitative real-time PCR (mqPCR) was applied to samples collected from Oak Ridge IFC site areas 1 and 3, which are not connected by the primary groundwater flow paths; however, transport between them through cross-plane fractures is hypothesized. Strain FRC-W accounted for more than 10% of the total quantifiable Anaeromyxobacter community in area 1 soils, while strain FRC-D1 was not detected. In FeOOH-amended enrichment cultures derived from area 1 site materials, strain FRC-D1 accounted for 30 to 90% of the total Anaeromyxobacter community, demonstrating that this strain was present in situ in area 1. The area 3 total Anaeromyxobacter abundance exceeded that of area 1 by 3 to 5 orders of magnitude, but neither strain FRC-W- nor FRC-D1-like sequences were quantifiable in any of the 33 area 3 groundwater or sediment samples tested. The Anaeromyxobacter community in area 3 increased from <10(5) cells/g sediment outside the ethanol biostimulation treatment zone to 10(8) cells/g sediment near the injection well, and 16S rRNA gene clone library analysis revealed that representatives of a novel phylogenetic cluster dominated the area 3 Anaeromyxobacter community inside the treatment loop. The combined applications of genus- and strain-level mqPCR approaches along with clone libraries provided novel information on patterns of microbial variability within a bacterial group relevant to uranium bioremediation.
Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play crucial roles in tumor development of osteosarcoma (OS). LncRNA PCAT6 was involved in the progression of multiple human cancers. However, the biological function of PCAT6 in OS remains largely unknown. We found that PCAT6 was elevated in OS tissues relative to that in their adjacent normal tissues. The upregulation of PCAT6 was positively associated with metastasis status and advanced stages and predicted poor overall and progression-free survivals in patients with OS. Functionally, silencing PCAT6 inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion abilities of OS cells. Mechanistically, PCAT6, acting as a competitive endogenous RNA, upregulated expression of TGFBR1 and TGFBR2 to activate TGF-β pathway via sponging miR-185-5p. This study uncovers a novel underlying molecular mechanism of PCAT6-miR-185-5p-TGFBR1/2-TGF-β signaling axis in promoting tumor progression in OS, which indicates that PCAT6 may serve as a promising prognostic factor and therapeutic target again OS.
Paget's disease of bone is characterized by the progressive and extensive replacement, in one or several bones, of normal bone tissue by a bone tissue of rough and irregular structure, the excessive and disorderly renewal of which gradually produces hyperdensity and hypertrophy of the bones involved. The condition results from the action of abnormal and overactive osteoclasts containing virus-like intranuclear and intracytoplasmic inclusions. The disease profoundly alters the physiology of bones in the region affected. The viral-looking inclusions that enter the osteoclasts seem to induce a loss of control of bone renewal and remodelling, as shown by histology and radiology. The resorption-formation mechanism persists but it is unbalanced, facilitating bone resorption during two to five years, then bone formation. In that way, subjects with Paget's disease, who have reached the age of physiological osteopenia, show an often important increase in bone density and mass. Paget's disease of bone is a disease grafted on the skeleton: it is partly dependent on the skeletal status of the host. The activity of Paget's disease is evaluated by measuring the ratio of plasma alkaline phosphatase levels to the volumes of normal and pagetic bones; the author suggests a mathematical formula for calculating this ratio.
Reversible haemolytic anaemia associated with decreased red cell half-life and reticulocytosis was studied in 10 patients with Zieve's syndrome. Since the underlying cause of the red cell destruction is as yet unknown, we determined the critical metabolic functions of the red cells in order to define the assumed intracorpuscular defect causing haemolysis. The glucose metabolizing enzymes had normal or raised values. - In view of the diminished ATP and raised 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2.3 DPG) levels - a combination which suggests a pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency - additional procedures were carried out in order to detect an abnormal activity of the red cell PK. Studies of biochemical properties of PK such as thermostability, Michaelis-Menten constants, and activation and inhibition tests brought results markedly deviating from the norm.-Fractions containing old cells particularly disclosed PK instability. A defective red cell matabolism resulted which was measurable through ATP-instability, altered glucose utilization and lactate production. - Experimental cell aging procedures led to a markedly decreased red cell metabolism. These assays revealed that mutations of PK-control mechanisms might be involved as factor triggering haemolytic anaemia of Zieve's syndrome.
GC level distributions of a species' nuclear genome, or of its compositional fractions, encode key information on structural and functional properties of the genome and on its evolution. They can be calculated either from absorbance profiles of the DNA in CsCl density gradients at sedimentation equilibrium, or by scanning long contigs of largely sequenced genomes. In the present study, we address the quantitative characterization of the compositional heterogeneity of genomes, as measured by the GC distributions of fixed-length fragments. Special attention is given to mammalian genomes, since their compartmentalization into isochores implies two levels of heterogeneity, intra-isochore (local) and inter-isochore (global). This partitioning is a natural one, since large-scale compositional properties vary much more among isochores than within them. Intra-isochore GC distributions become roughly Gaussian for long fragments, and their standard deviations decrease only slowly with increasing fragment length, unlike random sequences. This effect can be explained by 'long-range' correlations, often overlooked, that are present along isochores.
Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion and predisposes to the development of hyperplastic or neoplastic changes in the parathyroid and pituitary glands and the endocrine pancreas, along with numerous other characteristic tumors and features. The management of each entity differs to some degree from their sporadic counterparts, while the lack of a genotype-phenotype correlation requires lifelong clinical, biochemical and radiological screening for the development of new tumors. While the syndrome itself is relatively rare (a prevalence of 1-10/100 000), it is likely that health-care practitioners from numerous specialities will occasionally encounter a patient with MEN1 and therefore a basic knowledge of the syndrome is important. In addition, many of the associated tumors are seen commonly in sporadic form, and a judicious policy is therefore required in deciding how thoroughly patients who develop these tumors should be screened for MEN1. The current literature on MEN1 is reviewed and key learning points are suggested for the clinician.
Idiopathic toe-walking is a diagnosis of exclusion when a child presents with bilateral toe-to-toe gait. Although toe-walking is considered part of the normal gait spectrum in development, it is abnormal when persisting past the age of two. Toe-walking may be caused by cerebral palsy, congenital contracture of the Achilles tendon or paralytic muscular disorders such as Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. Idiopathic toe-walking may be associated with developmental disorders such as autism or other myopathic or neuropathic disorders. The majority of disorders causing toe-walking can be ruled out through the history and physical examination, resulting in a diagnosis of idiopathic toe-walking. However, it may be difficult to differentiate mild forms of cerebral palsy, specifically mild spastic diplegia, and idiopathic toe-walking. The treatment options for idiopathic toe-walking include observation, conservative methods and surgical methods. Most children can be treated in the primary care setting with either observation or conservative treatment. Patients with severe contracture of the Achilles tendon, or persistent toe-walking, may need surgical intervention. The prognosis of idiopathic toe-walking is favorable with both conservative and surgical treatment allowing children to attain normal function and range of plantarflexion. The following article provides an overview of the background information, differential diagnosis and treatment options for idiopathic toe-walking.
BACKGROUND: Global scale brain research collaborations such as the ENIGMA (Enhancing Neuro Imaging Genetics through Meta Analysis) consortium are beginning to collect data in large quantity and to conduct meta-analyses using uniformed protocols. It becomes strategically important that the results can be communicated among brain scientists effectively. Traditional graphs and charts failed to convey the complex shapes of brain structures which are essential to the understanding of the result statistics from the analyses. These problems could be addressed using interactive visualization strategies that can link those statistics with brain structures in order to provide a better interface to understand brain research results.RESULTS: We present ENIGMA-Viewer, an interactive web-based visualization tool for brain scientists to compare statistics such as effect sizes from meta-analysis results on standardized ROIs (regions-of-interest) across multiple studies. The tool incorporates visualization design principles such as focus+context and visual data fusion to enable users to better understand the statistics on brain structures. To demonstrate the usability of the tool, three examples using recent research data are discussed via case studies.CONCLUSIONS: ENIGMA-Viewer supports presentations and communications of brain research results through effective visualization designs. By linking visualizations of both statistics and structures, users can gain more insights into the presented data that are otherwise difficult to obtain. ENIGMA-Viewer is an open-source tool, the source code and sample data are publicly accessible through the NITRC website ( http://www.nitrc.org/projects/enigmaviewer_20 ). The tool can also be directly accessed online ( http://enigma-viewer.org ).
The transcriptional co-activator p300 is a histone acetyltransferase (HAT) that is typically recruited to transcriptional enhancers and regulates gene expression by acetylating chromatin. Here we show that the activation of p300 directly depends on the activation and oligomerization status of transcription factor ligands. Using two model transcription factors, IRF3 and STAT1, we demonstrate that transcription factor dimerization enables the trans-autoacetylation of p300 in a highly conserved and intrinsically disordered autoinhibitory lysine-rich loop, resulting in p300 activation. We describe a crystal structure of p300 in which the autoinhibitory loop invades the active site of a neighbouring HAT domain, revealing a snapshot of a trans-autoacetylation reaction intermediate. Substrate access to the active site involves the rearrangement of an autoinhibitory RING domain. Our data explain how cellular signalling and the activation and dimerization of transcription factors control the activation of p300, and therefore explain why gene transcription is associated with chromatin acetylation.
It remains unclear whether flecainide, a Class I antiarrhythmic drug, improves left ventricular pressure gradient (LVPG) or symptoms in patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Our study evaluated the long-term efficacy of flecainide, compared to disopyramide, when administered orally, on LVPG and symptoms in obstructive HCM patients. Among 164 obstructive HCM patients, 15 were administered oral flecainide therapy and 33 administered oral disopyramide therapy. LVPG declined from 79.8 ± 36.6 to 39.2 ± 36.7 mmHg (p = 0.003) after flecainide therapy and from 74.5 ± 26.4 to 31.4 ± 24.8 mmHg (p < 0.001) after disopyramide therapy. The percent reduction in LVPG was -47.9 ± 43.2 % in patients treated with flecainide, comparable to the results for those treated with disopyramide (-57.1 ± 33.0 %; p = 0.425). We found no significant differences in improvement in NYHA functional class between patients treated with flecainide and those treated with disopyramide (p = 0.331). Patients treated with flecainide exhibited no significant adverse side effects, and there was no need for myectomy or alcohol septal ablation to reduce LVPG and symptoms. Improvements in LVPG and symptoms were similar in patients treated with flecainide and patients treated with disopyramide, suggesting that flecainide is a potentially useful alternative for symptomatic obstructive HCM patients, particularly those with disopyramide-induced vagolytic side effects, narrow angle glaucoma, or prostatic hyperplasia and pre-existing urination difficulties. Our data must be viewed with caution, however, in view of the small number of study patients. Flecainide therapy will require further proof of safety before it can be routinely recommended in patients with symptomatic obstructive HCM.
BACKGROUND: Clinically significant mutations of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are associated with increased susceptibility for breast and ovarian cancer. Although these mutations are uncommon, public interest in testing for them is growing.PURPOSE: To determine benefits and harms of screening for inherited breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility in the general population of women without cancer presenting for primary health care in the United States.DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE (1966 to 1 October 2004), Cochrane Library databases, reference lists, reviews, Web sites, and experts.STUDY SELECTION: Eligibility was determined by inclusion criteria specific to key questions about risk assessment, genetic counseling, mutation testing, prevention interventions, and potential adverse effects.DATA EXTRACTION: After review of studies, data were extracted, entered into evidence tables, and summarized by using descriptive or statistical methods. Study quality was rated by using predefined criteria.DATA SYNTHESIS: Tools assessing risks for mutations and referral guidelines have been developed; their accuracy, effectiveness, and adverse effects in primary care settings are unknown. Risk assessment, genetic counseling, and mutation testing did not cause adverse psychological outcomes, and counseling improved distress and risk perception in the highly selected populations studied. Intensive cancer screening studies are inconclusive. Chemoprevention trials indicate risk reduction for breast cancer in women with varying levels of risk, as well as increased adverse effects. Observational studies of prophylactic surgeries report reduced risks for breast and ovarian cancer in mutation carriers.LIMITATIONS: No data describe the range of risk associated with BRCA mutations, genetic heterogeneity, and moderating factors; studies conducted in highly selected populations contain biases; and information on adverse effects is incomplete.CONCLUSIONS: A primary care approach to screening for inherited breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility has not been evaluated, and evidence is lacking to determine benefits and harms for the general population.
OBJECTIVE: To review the literature and describe the pharmacologic, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic properties; clinical safety; and efficacy of dapagliflozin, a new drug currently under review by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.DATA SOURCES: A MEDLINE (1995-November 2011) and ClinicalTrials.gov search was conducted using the terms dapagliflozin, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor, and SGLT2 inhibitor. Reference citations from publications identified were also reviewed.STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: All English-language studies, including abstracts, evaluating dapagliflozin use in humans were included in this review.DATA SYNTHESIS: Dapagliflozin is the first-in-class oral sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor that represents a new potential therapeutic option for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Its mechanism of action is insulin- and insulin-sensitivity independent. Preliminary data suggest that dapagliflozin decreases hemoglobin A(1c), fasting plasma glucose, and postprandial plasma glucose, while also promoting weight loss. In Phase 1, 2, and 3 clinical trials, dapagliflozin has exhibited a safety and tolerability profile similar to that of placebo.CONCLUSIONS: Dapagliflozin is a novel oral antihyperglycemic agent that has demonstrated promise as monotherapy and as synergistic combination therapy with currently available agents in Phase 3 clinical trials. On January 19, 2012, the FDA issued a complete response letter to AstraZeneca and Bristol-Myers Squibb regarding the new drug application for dapagliflozin. The FDA is requesting additional clinical data-from ongoing studies and potentially new clinical trials-to better describe the risk-benefit profile of the drug. Both manufacturers remain committed to the development of dapagliflozin, and there are currently 8 Phase 3 trials ongoing. Dapagliflozin has the potential to be the next new oral agent in the diabetes drug armamentarium.
In situ hybridization of five new and one previously described alpha-satellite sequences isolated from chromosome 21 libraries gave the following chromosomal distribution patterns: (a) two sequences (pTRA-1 and -4) hybridizing to chromosomes 13, 14, 15, 21, and 22 (also 19 and 20); (b) one sequence (pTRA-7) hybridizing to chromosome 14; and (c) three sequences (pTRA-2, -11 and -15) hybridizing to chromosomes 13, 14, and 21, with significant but weaker signals on 15 and 22. These results suggested the sharing of alphoid domains between different acrocentric chromosomes and the coexistence of multiple domains on each chromosome. Analysis of somatic cell hybrids carrying a single human acrocentric chromosome using pTRA-2 demonstrated a higher-order repeating structure common to chromosomes 13, 14, and 21, but not to 15 and 22, providing direct evidence for sequence homogenization in this domain among the former three chromosomes. We present a model of evolution and genetic exchange of alpha sequences on the acrocentric chromosomes which can satisfactorily explain these and previous observations of (a) two different alphoid subfamilies, one common to chromosomes 13 and 21 and the other common to chromosomes 14 and 22, (b) a different alphoid subfamily on chromosome 22, and (c) nonrandom participation of chromosomes 13 and 14, and 14 and 21 in Robertsonian translocations.
BACKGROUND: The single-stranded RNA Flavivirus, Zika virus (ZIKV), has recently re-emerged and spread rapidly across the western hemisphere's equatorial countries, primarily through Aedes mosquito transmission. While symptoms in adult infections appear to be self-limiting and mild, severe birth defects, such as microcephaly, have been linked to infection during early pregnancy. Recently, Tang et al. (Cell Stem Cell 2016, doi: 10.1016/j.stem.2016.02.016) demonstrated that ZIKV efficiently infects induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs), resulting in cell cycle abnormalities and apoptosis. Consequently, hNPCs are a suggested ZIKV target.METHODS: We analyzed the transcriptomic sequencing (RNA-seq) data (GEO: GSE78711) of ZIKV (Strain: MR766) infected hNPCs. For comparison to the ZIKV-infected hNPCs, the expression data from hNPCs infected with human cytomegalovirus (CMV) (Strain: AD169) was used (GEO: GSE35295). Utilizing a combination of Gene Ontology, database of human diseases, and pathway analysis, we generated a putative systemic model of infection supported by known molecular pathways of other highly related viruses.RESULTS: We analyzed RNA-sequencing data for transcript expression alterations in ZIKV-infected hNPCs, and then compared them to expression patterns of iPSC-derived hNPCs infected with CMV, a virus that can also induce severe congenital neurological defects in developing fetuses. We demonstrate for the first time that many of cellular pathways correlate with clinical pathologies following ZIKV infection such as microcephaly, congenital nervous system disorders and epilepsy. Furthermore, ZIKV activates several inflammatory signals within infected hNPCs that are implicated in innate and acquired immune responses, while CMV-infected hNPCs showed limited representation of these pathways. Moreover, several genes related to pathogen responses are significantly upregulated upon ZIKV infection, but not perturbed in CMV-infected hNPCs.CONCLUSION: The presented study is the first to report enrichment of numerous pro-inflammatory pathways in ZIKV-infected hNPCs, indicating that hNPCs are capable of signaling through canonical pro-inflammatory pathways following viral infection. By defining gene expression profiles, new factors in the pathogenesis of ZIKV were identified which could help develop new therapeutic strategies.
BACKGROUND: The cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19 isoenzyme plays an important role in clopidogrel metabolization. A recently explored CYP2C19*17 allelic variant has been linked to increased transcriptional activity, resulting in extensive metabolization of CYP2C19 substrates, which may lead to an enhanced platelet response to clopidogrel treatment. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of CYP2C19*17 on ADP-induced platelet aggregation, the risk of bleeding, and stent thrombosis in clopidogrel-treated patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention.METHODS AND RESULTS: The study population included 1524 patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention after pretreatment with 600 mg clopidogrel. Genotypes were determined with a TaqMan assay. ADP-induced platelet aggregation was assessed on a Multiplate analyzer. The primary clinical safety end point was the 30-day incidence of bleeding defined according to Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction criteria, and the primary clinical efficacy end point was the 30-day incidence of stent thrombosis. For both heterozygous (*wt/*17; n=546) and homozygous (*17/*17; n=76) allele carriers, significantly lower ADP-induced platelet aggregation values were found compared with wild-type homozygotes (*wt/*wt; n=902; P=0.039 and P=0.008, respectively). CYP2C19*17 allele carriage was significantly associated with an increased risk of bleeding; the highest risk was observed for CYP2C19*17 homozygous patients (P=0.01, chi(2) test for trend). Multivariate analysis confirmed the independent association of CYP2C19*17 allele carriage with platelet aggregation values (P<0.001) and the occurrence of bleeding (P=0.006). No significant influence of CYP2C19*17 on the occurrence of stent thrombosis was found (P=0.79).CONCLUSIONS: CYP2C19*17 carrier status is significantly associated with enhanced response to clopidogrel and an increased risk of bleeding.
OBJECTIVE: Although vulvodynia occurs in approximately 7% of adult American women, we hypothesize that vulvodynia also occurs in young girls and that they respond to treatments that are similar to those used in women with this disorder.MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective case study of vulvodynia in preadolescent girls seen in our referral practice. Records of all office visits and any telephone or e-mailed follow-up were reviewed.RESULTS: Between October 1996 and April 2006, 6 girls ages 4 to 11 years were evaluated and diagnosed with vulvodynia. Pain had been present for several months to 7 years, and most patients had been seen by several physicians before having this diagnosis made. Treatment was typically initiated with a tricyclic antidepressant, and 5 of the 6 girls noted improvement in their symptoms, including 2 who had marked improvement, and another 3 with substantial improvement who were able to discontinue therapy without a recurrence.CONCLUSIONS: Vulvodynia does occur among young girls and, when treated as a neuropathic pain disorder, was found to dramatically improve or remit in the majority of those treated in this small case series. This underrecognized disorder should be considered in cases of ongoing vulvar discomfort, regardless of age.
We present comparisons of the clinical pictures in a series of 60 patients with nemaline myopathy in whom mutations had been identified in the genes for nebulin or skeletal muscle alpha-actin. In the patients with nebulin mutations, the typical form of nemaline myopathy predominated, while severe, mild or intermediate forms were less frequent. Autosomal recessive inheritance had been verified or appeared likely in all nebulin cases. In the patients with actin mutations, the severe form of nemaline myopathy was the most common, but some had the mild or typical form, and a few showed other associated features such as intranuclear rods or actin accumulation. Most cases were sporadic, but in addition there were instances of both autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive inheritance, while two families showed mosaicism for dominant mutations. Although no specific phenotype was found to be associated with mutations in either gene, clinical and histological features together with pedigree data may be used in guiding mutation detection. Finding the causative mutation(s) determines the mode of inheritance and permits prenatal diagnosis if requested, but will not as such permit prognostication.
PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Familial chilblain lupus belongs to the group of type I interferonopathies and is characterized by typical skin manifestations and acral ischaemia. This review aims to give an overview of clinical signs and the pathophysiological mechanisms.RECENT FINDINGS: There are several mutations that can lead to this autosomal dominant disease. Most frequent is a mutation of the gene for TREX-1. However, as well cases of families with mutations in the SAMHD1 gene and, recently, with one for the gene that codes for the protein stimulator of interferon genes have been described. These genes are involved in the process of the detection of intracellular DNA, and their mutation results in an increased production of type I interferons and their gene products, resulting in auto-inflammation and auto-immunity. JAK inhibitors have been successfully used to treat this disorder. Familial chilblain is a rare disorder with very distinct clinical signs. Its pathophysiological mechanism gives insight into the process of interferon-induced inflammation in auto-immune diseases.
The use of fecal microbiota transplantation in recurrent Clostridium difficile infection and coexistent inflammatory bowel disease remains unclear. A 61-year-old man with ulcerative pancolitis was diagnosed with a third recurrence of Clostridium difficile infection, previously treated with metronidazole, vancomycin and fidaxomicin. Fecal microbiota transplantation of an unrelated healthy donor was performed by the lower route. After a twelve month follow-up, the patient remains asymptomatic without Clostridium difficile infection relapses or inflammatory bowel disease flare-ups. Fecal microbiota transplantation is relatively simple to perform, well-tolerated, safe and effective in recurrent Clostridium difficile infection with ulcerative pancolitis, as an alternative in case of antibiotic therapy failure.
Human parechovirus (HPeV) belongs to the Picornaviridae family of RNA viruses. HPeV infections can be asymptomatic, lead to mild respiratory and/or gastrointestinal symptoms, or less frequently cause severe diseases such as sepsis, meningitis, encephalitis, and myocarditis. Severe neurological HPeV infections occur most commonly in infants and neonates. There are currently 16 recognized types of HPeV. HPeV type 3 (HPeV3) has been the predominant type associated with severe central nervous system disease in neonates and newborns since its discovery in 1999. Although HPeV-related infections have been reported in adults, symptomatic HPeV3 infections in adolescents and adults are uncommon. A case of severe HPeV3 myocarditis and encephalitis in an adolescent is described.
INTRODUCTION: To guide the use of modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) vaccine in response to a release of smallpox virus, the immunogenicity and safety of shorter vaccination intervals, and administration by jet injector (JI), were compared to the standard schedule of administration on Days 1 and 29 by syringe and needle (S&N).METHODS: Healthy adults 18-40years of age were randomly assigned to receive MVA vaccine subcutaneously by S&N on Days 1 and 29 (standard), Days 1 and 15, or Days 1 and 22, or to receive the vaccine subcutaneously by JI on Days 1 and 29. Blood was collected at four time points after the second vaccination for plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) (primary endpoint) and ELISA (secondary endpoint) antibody assays. For each subject, the peak PRNT (or ELISA) titer was defined by the highest PRNT (or ELISA) titer among all available measurements post second vaccination. Non-inferiority of a non-standard arm compared to the standard arm was met if the upper limit of the 98.33% confidence interval of the difference in the mean log2 peak titers between the standard and non-standard arm was less than 1.RESULTS: Non-inferiority of the PRNT antibody response was not established for any of the three non-standard study arms. Non-inferiority of the ELISA antibody response was established for the Day 1 and 22 compressed schedule and for administration by JI. Solicited local reactions, such as redness and swelling, tended to be more commonly reported with JI administration. Four post-vaccination hypersensitivity reactions were observed.CONCLUSIONS: Evaluations of the primary endpoint of PRNT antibody responses do not support alternative strategies of administering MVA vaccine by S&N on compressed schedules or administration by JI on the standard schedule.TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01827371.
Severe neutropenia disorders are characterized by extremely low levels of peripheral blood neutrophils, a maturation block of bone marrow progenitor cells and recurring severe bacterial and fungal infections. Recent reports indicated that severe neutropenia is a consequence of an impaired survival and abnormal cell cycle progression of myeloid progenitor cells in both cyclic and severe congenital neutropenia. Mutations in the neutrophil elastase gene were identified in all patients with cyclic neutropenia and most of the patients with severe congenital neutropenia. We hypothesize that expression of mutant neutrophil elastase protein results in deregulation of intracellular activity and premature cell death of myeloid-committed progenitor cells in these disorders, resulting in the lack of peripheral blood neutrophils. The potential molecular mechanisms of mutant-protein-mediated neutropenia is discussed.
To construct a regulatory map of the genome of the human pathogen, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, we applied two complementary high-resolution approaches: strand-specific RNA-seq, to survey the global transcriptome, and ChIP-seq, to monitor the genome-wide dynamics of RNA polymerase (RNAP) and the anti-terminator NusA. Although NusA does not bind directly to DNA, but rather to RNAP and/or to the nascent transcript, we demonstrate that NusA interacts with RNAP ubiquitously throughout the chromosome, and that its profile mirrors RNAP distribution in both the exponential and stationary phases of growth. Generally, promoter-proximal peaks for RNAP and NusA were observed, followed by a decrease in signal strength reflecting transcriptional polarity. Differential binding of RNAP and NusA in the two growth conditions correlated with transcriptional activity as reflected by RNA abundance. Indeed, a significant association between expression levels and the presence of NusA throughout the gene body was detected, confirming the peculiar transcription-promoting role of NusA. Integration of the data sets pinpointed transcriptional units, mapped promoters and uncovered new anti-sense and non-coding transcripts. Highly expressed transcriptional units were situated mainly on the leading strand, despite the relatively unbiased distribution of genes throughout the genome, thus helping the replicative and transcriptional complexes to align.
CONTEXT: Germline AIP mutations usually cause young-onset acromegaly with low penetrance in a subset of familial isolated pituitary adenoma families. We describe our experience with a large family with R304* AIP mutation and discuss some of the diagnostic dilemmas and management issues.OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to identify and screen mutation carriers in the family.PATIENTS: Forty-three family members participated in the study.SETTING: The study was performed in university hospitals.OUTCOME: We conducted genetic and endocrine screening of family members.RESULTS: We identified 18 carriers of the R304* mutation, three family members with an AIP-variant A299V, and two family members who harbored both changes. One of the two index cases presented with gigantism and pituitary apoplexy, the other presented with young-onset acromegaly, and both had surgery and radiotherapy. After genetic and clinical screening of the family, two R304* carriers were diagnosed with acromegaly. They underwent transsphenoidal surgery after a short period of somatostatin analog treatment. One of these two patients is in remission; the other achieved successful pregnancy despite suboptimal control of acromegaly. One of the A299V carrier family members was previously diagnosed with a microprolactinoma; we consider this case to be a phenocopy. Height of the unaffected R304* carrier family members is not different compared to noncarrier relatives.CONCLUSIONS: Families with AIP mutations present particular problems such as the occurrence of large invasive tumors, poor response to medical treatment, difficulties with fertility and management of pregnancy, and the finding of AIP sequence variants of unknown significance. Because disease mostly develops at a younger age and penetrance is low, the timing and duration of the follow-up of carriers without overt disease requires further study. The psychological and financial impact of prolonged clinical screening must be considered. Excellent relationships between the family, endocrinologists, and geneticists are essential, and ideally these families should be managed in centers with specialist expertise.
The cochlea, a coiled structure located in the ventral region of the inner ear, acts as the primary structure for the perception of sound. Along the length of the cochlear spiral is the organ of Corti, a highly derived and rigorously patterned sensory epithelium that acts to convert auditory stimuli into neural impulses. The development of the organ of Corti requires a series of inductive events that specify unique cellular characteristics and axial identities along its three major axes. Here, we review recent studies of the cellular and molecular processes regulating several aspects of cochlear development, such as axial patterning, cochlear outgrowth and cellular differentiation. We highlight how the precise coordination of multiple signaling pathways is required for the successful formation of a complete organ of Corti.
As the drug development pipeline for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) rapidly advances, clinical trial outcomes need to be optimized. Effective assessment of disease burden, natural history progression, and response to therapy in clinical trials for Duchenne muscular dystrophy are critical factors for clinical trial success. By choosing optimal biomarkers to better assess therapeutic efficacy, study costs and sample size requirements can be reduced. Currently, functional measures continue to serve as the primary outcome for the majority of DMD clinical trials. Quantitative measures of muscle health, including magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy, electrical impedance myography, and ultrasound, sensitively identify diseased muscle, disease progression, and response to a therapeutic intervention. Furthermore, such non-invasive techniques have the potential to identify disease pathology prior to onset of clinical symptoms. Despite robust supportive evidence, non-invasive quantitative techniques are still not frequently utilized in clinical trials for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Non-invasive quantitative techniques have demonstrated the ability to quantify disease progression and potential response to therapeutic intervention, and should be used as a supplement to current standard functional measures. Such methods have the potential to significantly accelerate the development and approval of therapies for DMD.
Earlier studies have shown frequent mutations in the BRAF and NRAS genes in cutaneous melanoma, but these alterations have not been examined in the rare category of melanoma from black Africans. Moreover, the frequency of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations in melanocytic tumors is not known. We therefore examined 165 benign and malignant melanocytic lesions (including 118 invasive melanomas and 18 metastases collected as consecutive cases from various time periods and from two different pathology departments; the 51 nodular melanomas were randomly selected from a larger, consecutive, population-based series of nodular melanomas) with respect to alterations in the EGFR, BRAF and NRAS genes. Mutations in EGFR (exons 18-21) were not detected. EGFR protein expression was observed in a subgroup of melanomas, but without associations with clinicopathologic phenotype or prognosis. Cytoplasmic EGFR expression was, however, significantly increased from benign nevi to melanomas. Mutations in BRAF and NRAS were detected in superficial melanoma (25 and 29%, respectively), nodular melanoma (29 and 28%, respectively) and lentigo maligna melanoma (15 and 16%, respectively). In a series of melanomas from black Africans (n=26), only two BRAF mutations (8%) were found, both being different from the common T1799A substitution. Moreover, melanomas from black Africans exhibited mutations in NRAS exon 1 only (12%), whereas NRAS exon 2 mutations were predominant in melanomas from Caucasians. Thus, the frequencies of BRAF and NRAS mutations were particularly low in melanomas from black Africans, supporting a different pathogenesis of these tumors.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the current nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatment options for symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD).DATA SOURCES: Literature was obtained through searches of MEDLINE Ovid (1950-March week 3, 2008) and EMBASE Drugs and Pharmacology (all years), as well as a bibliographic review of articles identified by the searches. Key terms included premenstrual syndrome, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, PMS, PMDD, and treatment.STUDY SELECTION/DATA EXTRACTION: All pertinent clinical trials, retrospective studies, and case reports in human subjects published in the English language were identified and evaluated for the safety and efficacy of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments of PMS/PMDD. Data from these studies and information from review articles were included in this review.DATA SYNTHESIS: Selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have been proven safe and effective for the treatment of PMDD and are recommended as first-line agents when pharmacotherapy is warranted. Currently fluoxetine, controlled-release paroxetine, and sertraline are the only Food and Drug Administration-approved agents for this indication. Suppression of ovulation using hormonal therapies is an alternative approach to treating PMDD when SSRIs or second-line psychotropic agents are ineffective; however, adverse effects limit their use. Anxiolytics, spironolactone, and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs can be used as supportive care to relieve symptoms. Despite lack of specific evidence, lifestyle modifications and exercise are first-line recommendations for all women with PMS/PMDD and may be all that is needed to treat mild-to-moderate symptoms. Herbal and vitamin supplementation and complementary and alternative medicine have been evaluated for use in PMS/PMDD and have produced unclear or conflicting results. More controlled clinical trials are needed to determine their safety and efficacy and potential for drug interactions.CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare providers need to be aware of the symptoms of PMS and PMDD and the treatment options available. Treatment selection should be based on individual patient symptoms, concomitant medical history, and need for contraception.
Resistance training (RT) is a popular method of conditioning to enhance sport performance as well as an effective form of exercise to attenuate the age-mediated decline in muscle strength and mass. Although the benefits of RT on skeletal muscle morphology and function are well established, its effect on left ventricular (LV) morphology remains equivocal. Some investigations have found that RT is associated with an obligatory increase in LV wall thickness and mass with minimal alteration in LV internal cavity dimension, an effect called concentric hypertrophy. However, others report that short- (<5 years) to long-term (>18 years) RT does not alter LV morphology, arguing that concentric hypertrophy is not an obligatory adaptation secondary to this form of exertion. This disparity between studies on whether RT consistently results in cardiac hypertrophy could be caused by: (i) acute cardiopulmonary mechanisms that minimise the increase in transmural pressure (i.e. ventricular pressure minus intrathoracic pressure) and LV wall stress during exercise; (ii) the underlying use of anabolic steroids by the athletes; or (iii) the specific type of RT performed. We propose that when LV geometry is altered after RT, the pattern is usually concentric hypertrophy in Olympic weightlifters. However, the pattern of eccentric hypertrophy (increased LV mass secondary to an increase in diastolic internal cavity dimension and wall thickness) is not uncommon in bodybuilders. Of particular interest, nearly 40% of all RT athletes have normal LV geometry, and these athletes are typically powerlifters. RT athletes who use anabolic steroids have been shown to have significantly higher LV mass compared with drug-free sport-matched athletes. This brief review will sort out some of the factors that may affect the acute and chronic outcome of RT on LV morphology. In addition, a conceptual framework is offered to help explain why cardiac hypertrophy is not always found in RT athletes.
PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Acute and chronic sinusitis can give rise to a wide array of intracranial and orbital complications. These complications include brain abscess, subdural empyema, epidural abscess, meningitis, venous sinus thrombosis, frontal bone osteomyelitis, and orbital cellulitis and abscess. Despite numerous medical advances, these complications carry a risk of mortality and significant morbidity.RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies have shown improvement in both the mortality and the morbidity associated with the neurologic complications of acute and chronic sinusitis. However, there are still a large portion of patients with long-term sequelae, and the literature reports a morbidity rate of approximately 30%. The most common post-treatment morbidities include permanent changes in vision, seizures, and hemiparesis. Although the overall incidence of neurologic complications from a sinogenic source are rare, the potential long-term complications can be devastating making prompt diagnosis and treatment vital to improving outcomes.
Prothymosin alpha (proTalpha) is a 109 amino acid long polypeptide presenting distinct immunoenhancing activity in vitro and in vivo. Recent reports suggest that in apoptotic cells, proTalpha is cleaved by caspases at its carboxy(C)-terminus generating potentially bioactive fragments. In this study, we identified the peptide segment of proTalpha presenting maximum immunomodulatory activity. Calf thymus proTalpha was trypsinised, and the five fragments produced (spanning residues 1-14, 21-30, 31-87, 89-102 and 103-109) were tested for their ability to stimulate healthy donor- and cancer patient-derived peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) proliferation in autologous mixed lymphocyte reaction (AMLR), natural killer and lymphokine-activated killer cell activity, intracellular production of perforin, upregulation of adhesion molecules and CD25 expression. ProTalpha(89-102) and proTalpha(103-109) significantly fortified healthy donor-lymphocytes' immune responses to levels comparable to those induced by intact proTalpha. These effects were more pronounced in cancer patients, where peptides proTalpha(89-102) and proTalpha(103-109) partly, however significantly, restored the depressed AMLR and cytolytic ability of PBMC, by simulating the biological activity exerted by intact proTalpha. ProTalpha(1-14), proTalpha(21-30) and proTalpha(31-87) marginally upregulated lymphocyte activation. This is the first report showing that proTalpha's immunomodulating activity can be substituted by its C-terminal peptide(s). Whether generation and externalization of such immunoactive proTalpha fragments occurs in vivo, needs further investigation. However, if these peptides can trigger immune responses, they may eventually be used therapeutically to improve some PBMC functions of cancer patients.
BACKGROUND: Bundled care payments are increasingly being explored for neurosurgical interventions. In this setting, skilled nursing facility (SNF) is less desirable from a cost perspective than discharge to home, underscoring the need for better preoperative prediction of postoperative disposition.OBJECTIVE: To assess the capability of the Risk Assessment and Prediction Tool (RAPT) and other preoperative variables to determine expected disposition prior to surgery in a heterogeneous neurosurgical cohort, through observational study.METHODS: Patients aged 50 yr or more undergoing elective neurosurgery were enrolled from June 2016 to February 2017 (n = 623). Logistic regression was used to identify preoperative characteristics predictive of discharge disposition. Results from multivariate analysis were used to create novel grading scales for the prediction of discharge disposition that were subsequently compared to the RAPT Score using Receiver Operating Characteristic analysis.RESULTS: Higher RAPT Score significantly predicted home disposition (P < .001). Age 65 and greater, dichotomized RAPT walk score, and spinal surgery below L2 were independent predictors of SNF discharge in multivariate analysis. A grading scale utilizing these variables had superior discriminatory power between SNF and home/rehab discharge when compared with RAPT score alone (P = .004).CONCLUSION: Our analysis identified age, lower lumbar/lumbosacral surgery, and RAPT walk score as independent predictors of discharge to SNF, and demonstrated superior predictive power compared with the total RAPT Score when combined in a novel grading scale. These tools may identify patients who may benefit from expedited discharge to subacute care facilities and decrease inpatient hospital resource utilization following surgery.
Transthyretin (TTR), synthesized by the choroid plexuses (CP) has an important role in transporting thyroxine from blood to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). However, the role of TTR on thyroxine transport from CSF to either blood or brain is not clear. By using the incubated isolated ovine brain tissues technique, we found the CP accumulated most 125I-T4 compared to ventricular ependymal, frontal cortex or cerebellum. The accumulation was higher in the young CP than the old. There was dose-dependent inhibition by TTR on 125I-T4 accumulation in the brain tissues, and kinetics of T4 accumulation in presence of TTR was obtained by plotting a double reciprocal of B (bound) versus TTR concentration curve. The KD of 125I-T4 binding to TTR was higher in the CP compared to other tissues, suggesting that CP competes with TTR for T4 binding to a greater extent than the other tissues. Using the isolated perfused CP preparation, TTR significantly inhibited 125I-T4 efflux across CP from the CSF to blood side. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) was also able to inhibit 125I-T4 accumulation in the incubated tissues, but required higher concentrations to reach the level of inhibition seen with TTR. In conclusion, this study found a significant role for CSF TTR in preventing T4 loss to blood across the CP, and TTR inhibited both CP and selected brain tissue uptake in a dose-dependent manner. The physiological relevance of TTR may relate to preventing T4 loss from CSF and encouraging redistribution of hormone around the brain in CSF.
The microorganisms inhabiting the human gut are abundant (10(14) cells) and diverse (approximately 500 species per individual). It is now acknowledged that the microbiota has coevolved with its host to achieve a symbiotic relationship, leading to physiological homeostasis. The gut microbiota ensures vital functions, such as food digestibility, maturation of the host immune system, and protection against pathogens. Over the last few decades, the gut microbiota has also been associated with numerous diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, obesity, and metabolic diseases. In most of these pathologies, a microbial dysbiosis has been found, indicating shifts in the taxonomic composition of the gut microbiota and changes in its functionality. Our understanding of the influence of the gut microbiota on human health is still growing. Working with microorganisms residing in the gut is challenging since most of them are anaerobic and a vast majority (approximately 75%) are uncultivable to date. Recently, a wide range of new approaches (meta-omics) has been developed to bypass the uncultivability and reveal the intricate mechanisms that sustain gut microbial homeostasis. After a brief description of these approaches (metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, metaproteomics, and metabolomics), this review will discuss the importance of considering the gut microbiome as a structured ecosystem and the use of meta-omics to decipher dysfunctions of the gut microbiome in diseases.
Cardiorenal syndrome (CRS) clinical types, prevalence, aetiology, and acute cardiovascular morbidity impact on the outcome of acute kidney function perturbation were determined. Forty-seven of 101 (46.53%) patients with perturbed kidney function had CRS. Types 3 and 5 CRS were found in 10 and 37 patients, respectively. Type 3 CRS was due to acute glomerulonephritis (AGN; n = 7), captopril (n = 1), frusemide (n = 1), and hypovolaemia (n = 1). Malaria-associated haemoglobinuria (n = 20), septicaemia (n = 11), lupus nephritis (n = 3), tumour lysis syndrome (n = 2), and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (n = 1) caused Type 5 CRS. The cumulative mortality in hypertensive CRS was similar to nonhypertensive CRS (51.4% versus 40.9%; P = .119). Mortality in CRS and non-CRS was similar (45.7% versus 24.5%; P = .053). Type 5 survived better than type 3 CRS (66.7% versus 12.5%; P = .001). Risk factors for mortality were Type 3 CRS (P = .001), AGN-associated CRS (P = .023), dialysis requiring CRS (P = .008), and heart failure due to causes other than anaemia (P = .003). All-cause-mortality was 34.2%. Preventive measures aimed at the preventable CRS aetiologies might be critical to reducing its prevalence.
By identifying genomic sequence regions conserved among several species, comparative genomics offers opportunities to discover putatively functional elements without any prior knowledge of what these functions might be. Comparative analyses across mammals estimated 4-5% of the human genome to be functionally constrained, a much larger fraction than the 1-2% occupied by annotated protein-coding or RNA genes. Such functionally constrained yet unannotated regions have been referred to as conserved non-coding sequences (CNCs) or ultra-conserved elements (UCEs), which remain largely uncharacterized but probably form a highly heterogeneous group of elements including enhancers, promoters, motifs, and others. To facilitate the study of such CNCs/UCEs, we present our resource of Conserved Elements from Genomic Alignments (CEGA), accessible from http://cega.ezlab.org. Harnessing the power of multiple species comparisons to detect genomic elements under purifying selection, CEGA provides a comprehensive set of CNCs identified at different radiations along the vertebrate lineage. Evolutionary constraint is identified using threshold-free phylogenetic modeling of unbiased and sensitive global alignments of genomic synteny blocks identified using protein orthology. We identified CNCs independently for five vertebrate clades, each referring to a different last common ancestor and therefore to an overlapping but varying set of CNCs with 24 488 in vertebrates, 241 575 in amniotes, 709 743 in Eutheria, 642 701 in Boreoeutheria and 612 364 in Euarchontoglires, spanning from 6 Mbp in vertebrates to 119 Mbp in Euarchontoglires. The dynamic CEGA web interface displays alignments, genomic locations, as well as biologically relevant data to help prioritize and select CNCs of interest for further functional investigations.
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic inflammatory disease characterized by joint pain, swelling, stiffness, and progressive destruction of the small joints of the hands and feet. Treatment of RA has improved over the past decade. With multiple cytokines well-known now to play a role in the pathogenesis of RA, including tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-6, many targeted biological treatments against these cytokines have emerged, changing the treatment of this disease. Tocilizumab (TCZ) is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody against the IL-6 receptor and has been approved in many countries, including the United States, for the treatment of moderate to severe RA in patients who have not adequately responded to one or more disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) or cannot tolerate other approved drug classes for RA. The aim of this review is to discuss the role of IL-6 in RA, and to provide an overview of the mode of action, pharmacokinetics, and safety of TCZ. Furthermore, efficacy studies of TCZ as both monotherapy and combination therapy will be evaluated. There have been several important clinical trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of TCZ in RA patients; this review summarizes this data from 14 key trials with emphasis on Phase III trials. Review of these trials provides strong evidence that its use, both as monotherapy and in combination with methotrexate or other DMARDs, is an effective treatment in reducing the signs and symptoms of RA. TCZ showed tolerable safety but care is required for its use since there are some important safety concerns including elevated liver enzymes, elevated low-density lipoprotein, infections, and gastrointestinal perforations. Additionally, given the efficacy of TCZ in the treatment of RA, this review discusses how TCZ may be beneficial in the treatment of other autoimmune diseases, spinal disease, cardiovascular disease, organ transplantation, and malignancies where elevated levels of IL-6 may play a role in the pathogenesis of these diseases.
PURPOSE: The enzyme cholesterol 24S-hydroxylase (Cyp46A1) is responsible for the conversion of cholesterol to its more polar metabolite 24S-hydroxycholesterol, thereby enabling the intracerebral elimination of cholesterol. An intronic single nucleotide polymorphism in the gene CYP46A1 (IVS2 -150 T>C; rs754203) has recently been associated with primary open angle glaucoma (POAG). This association, however, lacks confirmation in other studies. The purpose of the present study was to investigate a hypothesized association between rs754203 and the presence of POAG in a Central European population of Caucasian descent.METHODS: The present institutional study comprised a total of 581 unrelated subjects: 330 patients with POAG, and 251 control subjects. Main outcome measures are genotype distributions and allelic frequencies determined by polymerase chain reaction.RESULTS: No significant differences in either genotype distribution or allelic frequencies were found between patients with POAG and control subjects (p>0.05). The presence of the rs754203 T-allele was associated with a nonsignificant odds ratio of 0.81 (95% CI: 0.63-1.04; p=0.11) for POAG.CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the rs754203 polymorphism itself is unlikely a genetic risk factor for POAG in Caucasian individuals.
Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) is an immunosuppressive cytokine that inhibits the proinflammatory functions of T cells, and it is a major factor in abrogating T cell activity against tumors. Canonical TGF-β signaling results in the activation of Smad proteins, which are transcription factors that regulate target gene expression. We found that the cell surface molecule platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) facilitated noncanonical (Smad-independent) TGF-β signaling in T cells. Subcutaneously injected tumor cells that are dependent on TGF-β-mediated suppression of immunity for growth grew more slowly in PECAM-1(-/-) mice than in their wild-type counterparts. T cells isolated from PECAM-1(-/-) mice demonstrated relative insensitivity to the TGF-β-dependent inhibition of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) production, granzyme B synthesis, and cellular proliferation. Similarly, human T cells lacking PECAM-1 demonstrated decreased sensitivity to TGF-β in a manner that was partially restored by reexpression of PECAM-1. Co-incubation of T cells with TGF-β and a T cell-activating antibody resulted in PECAM-1 phosphorylation on an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) and the recruitment of the inhibitory Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase-2 (SHP-2). Such conditions also induced the colocalization of PECAM-1 with the TGF-β receptor complex as identified by coimmunoprecipitation, confocal microscopy, and proximity ligation assays. These studies indicate a role for PECAM-1 in enhancing the inhibitory functions of TGF-β in T cells and suggest that therapeutic targeting of the PECAM-1-TGF-β inhibitory axis represents a means to overcome TGF-β-dependent immunosuppression within the tumor microenvironment.
Bartter syndrome (BS) is a rare renal tubular disorder presenting with hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis, which is classified into five types. KCNJ1 mutations usually cause the neonatal form of BS, type II BS (OMIM 241200). However, this report concerns a female patient with a novel, compound heterozygous KCNJ1 mutation that causes late-onset BS. The unique clinical findings of this case include persistently elevated 1,25(OH)(2) vitamin D levels, possibly due to increase prostaglandin E(2) levels, and medullary nephrocalcinosis. Treatment with COX-2 inhibitors resolved her hypercalciuria and improved her height and weight; renal function remains stable and there is no progression of nephrocalcinosis.
The proposed research will investigate two microbial communities that are of direct relevance to Department of Energy interests. One is the microbial community associated with the in situ bioremediation of uranium-contaminated groundwater. The second is a microbial community that harvests energy from waste organic matter in the form of electricity. These studies will address DOE needs for (1) remediation of metals and radionuclides at DOE sites and (2) the development of cleaner forms of energy and biomass conversion to energy. Our previous studies have demonstrated that the microbial communities involved in uranium bioremediation and energy harvesting are both dominated by microorganisms in the family Geobacteraceae and that the organisms in this family are responsible for uranium bioremediation and electron transfer to electrodes. The initial objectives of this study are to (1) describe the genetic potential of the Geobacteraceae that predominate in the environments of interest; (2) identify conserved patterns of gene expression within the Geobacteraceae family in response to a range of environmental conditions; (3) begin to identify mechanisms controlling the expression of key genes related to survival, growth, and activity in subsurface environments and on electrodes; and (4) use the results from subobjectives 1-3 to develop a conceptual model for predicting gene expression of Geobacteraceae in the environments of interest. This will serve as the basis for a subsequent simulation model of the growth and activity of Geobacteraceae in the subsurface and on electrodes.
HP1 proteins are major components of heterochromatin, which is generally perceived to be an inert and transcriptionally inactive chromatin structure. Yet, HP1 binding to chromatin is highly dynamic and robust silencing of heterochromatic genes can involve RNA processing. Here, we demonstrate by a combination of in vivo and in vitro experiments that the fission yeast HP1(Swi6) protein guarantees tight repression of heterochromatic genes through RNA sequestration and degradation. Stimulated by positively charged residues in the hinge region, RNA competes with methylated histone H3K9 for binding to the chromodomain of HP1(Swi6). Hence, HP1(Swi6) binding to RNA is incompatible with stable heterochromatin association. We propose a model in which an ensemble of HP1(Swi6) proteins functions as a heterochromatin-specific checkpoint, capturing and priming heterochromatic RNAs for the RNA degradation machinery. Sustaining a functional checkpoint requires continuous exchange of HP1(Swi6) within heterochromatin, which explains the dynamic localization of HP1 proteins on heterochromatin.
The ubiquitin-proteasome system has recently emerged as a major target for drug development in cancer therapy. The proteasome inhibitor bortezomib has clinical activity in multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma. Here we report that Eeyarestatin I (EerI), a chemical inhibitor that blocks endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated protein degradation, has antitumor and biologic activities similar to bortezomib and can synergize with bortezomib. Like bortezomib, EerI-induced cytotoxicity requires the up-regulation of the Bcl-2 homology3 (BH3)-only pro-apoptotic protein NOXA. We further demonstrate that both EerI and bortezomib activate NOXA via an unanticipated mechanism that requires cooperation between two processes. First, these agents elicit an integrated stress response program at the ER to activate the CREB/ATF transcription factors ATF3 and ATF4. We show that ATF3 and ATF4 form a complex capable of binding to the NOXA promoter, which is required for NOXA activation. Second, EerI and bortezomib also block ubiquitination of histone H2A to relieve its inhibition on NOXA transcription. Our results identify a class of anticancer agents that integrate ER stress response with an epigenetic mechanism to induce cell death.
BACKGROUND: Cerebral cavernous malformations (CCM) present as either sporadic or autosomal dominant conditions with incomplete penetrance of symptoms. Differences in genetic and environmental factors might be minimized among first-degree relatives. We therefore studied clinical expression in a family with several affected members.METHODS: We studied a three-generation family with the onset of CCM as a cerebral haemorrhage in the younger (four-year-old) sibling. Identification and enumeration of CCMs were performed in T2-weighted or gradient-echo MRIs of the whole brains. Genetic analysis comprised SCCP, sequencing and restriction polymorphism of the Krit1 gene in the proband and at risk relatives.RESULTS: The phenotypes of cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs) in carriers of Krit1 mutations were very variable. We identified a novel frameshift mutation caused by a 1902A insertion in exon 17 of the Krit1 gene, which leads to a premature TAA triplet and predicts the truncating phenotype Y634X. A very striking finding was the absence of both clinical symptoms and CCMs in the eldest sibling harbouring the 1902insA.CONCLUSIONS: Patients in this family, harbouring the same mutation, illustrate the very variable clinical and radiological expression of a Krit1 mutation. The early and critical onset in the proband contrasts with minor clinical findings in affected relatives. This consideration is important in genetic counselling.
The pharmacologic management of type 2 diabetes has changed dramatically in the past two decades. We have moved from a situation of only having two choices, insulin and sulfonylureas, to a position of myriad choices from 11 categories of medications (insulin, sulfonylureas, biguanides, α-glucosidase inhibitors, gliptins (dipeptidyl peptidase 4 [DPP IV] inhibitors), bromocriptine, glucagon-like peptide analogues, thiazolidinediones, glinides, amylin analogues and bile acid sequestrants. One of the most recent additions to this list are the DPP IV inhibitors commonly known as gliptins. Currently, there are four DPP IV inhibitors available in various countries-alogliptin, sitagliptin, vildagliptin and saxagliptin (1). Of these, two have been approved for clinical use in the United States: sitagliptin and saxagliptin. Additionally, linagliptin, vildagliptin and alogliptin are currently in phase III development in the United States while studies with another DPP IV inhibitor, dutogliptin, have been terminated (2). Alogliptin was approved for use in Japan under the trade name Nesina® in April 2010 (3). This manuscript will review alogliptin, its chemistry, pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, drug interactions, clinical trials and its current state of FDA review. Preclinical animal data have been reviewed elsewhere and will not be outlined in this manuscript. The interested reader is referred to those recent reviews (4, 5).
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignancies and exhibits heterogeneity in terms of clinical outcomes and biological activities. Emerging evidence has demonstrated that cancer stem cells (CSCs) play important roles in the tumorigenesis and progression of HCC. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the stemness maintenance of CSCs remain largely unknown. In the present study, through real-time PCR, western blotting, luciferase assays, RNA immunoprecipitation, and in vitro and in vivo assays, we demonstrated that miR-217 expression was markedly increased in HCC tissues and cells. Overexpression of miR-217 promoted, while silencing miR-217 suppressed, the fraction of the side population and the expression of cancer stem cell factors in vitro and tumorigenicity in vivo in HCC cells. Our findings further demonstrated that miR-217 promoted the CSC-like phenotype via dickkopf-1 (DKK1) targeting, resulting in constitutive activation of Wnt signaling. Moreover, the stimulatory effects of miR-217 on stem cell properties and Wnt signaling were antagonized by the upregulation of DKK1 in miR-217-overexpressing cells. Conversely, the inhibitory effects of silencing miR-217 on stem cell properties and Wnt signaling were reversed by the downregulation of DKK1 in miR-217-downregulated cells. Therefore, our results indicate that miR-217 plays a vital role in the CSC-like phenotypes of HCC cells and may be used as a potential therapeutic target against HCC.
Etoposide is effective as an anti-tumour drug by inhibiting eukaryotic DNA topoisomerase II via establishing a covalent complex with DNA. Unfortunately, its wide therapeutic application is often hindered by multidrug resistance (MDR), low water solubility and toxicity. In our previous study, new derivatives of benzoxazoles, benzimidazoles and related fused heterocyclic compounds, which exhibited significant eukaryotic DNA topoisomerase II inhibitory activity, were synthesized and exhibited better inhibitory activity compared with the drug etoposide itself. To expose the binding interactions between the eukaryotic topoisomerase II and the active heterocyclic compounds, docking studies were performed, using the software Discovery Studio 2.1, based on the crystal structure of the Topo IIA-bound G-segment DNA (PDB ID: 2RGR). The research was conducted on a selected set of 31 fused heterocyclic compounds with variation in structure and activity. The structural analyses indicate coordinate and hydrogen bonding interactions, van der Waals interactions and hydrophobic interactions between ligands and the protein, as Topo IIA-bound G-segment DNA are responsible for the preference of inhibition and potency. Collectively, the results demonstrate that the compounds 1a, 1c, 3b, 3c, 3e and 4a are significant anti-tumour drug candidates that should be further studied.
The Costello syndrome is characterized by dwarfism, unique cutaneous lesions, distinct facial gestalt, and mental retardation. We present a Japanese patient with the Costello syndrome. She showed high serum IgM level during the early infantile period. Nissen's fundplication was carried out to treat severe gastroesophageal reflux. Endocrinological investigations revealed a partial deficiency of growth hormone.
Although chronic stress is known to be linked with memory and other neurological disorders, little is known about the relationship between chronic stress and the onset or development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, we investigated the effects of long-term stress on the onset and severity of cognitive deficits and pathological changes in APPV717I-CT100 mice overexpressing human APP-CT100 containing the London mutation (V717I) after exposure to immobilization stress. We found that chronic immobilization stress accelerated cognitive impairments, as accessed by the Passive avoidance and the Social Transfer of Food Preference (STFP) tests. Moreover, the numbers and densities of vascular and extracellular deposits containing amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) and carboxyl-terminal fragments of amyloid precursor protein (APP-CTFs), which are pathologic markers of AD, were significantly elevated in stressed animals, especially in the hippocampus. Moreover, stressed animals, also showed highly elevated levels of neurodegeneration and tau phosphorylation and increased intraneuronal Abeta and APP-CTFs immunoreactivities in the hippocampus and in the entorhinal and piriform cortex. This study provides the first evidence that chronic stress accelerates the onset and severity of cognitive deficits and that these are highly correlated with pathological changes, which thus indicates that chronic stress may be an important contributor to the onset and development of AD.
Plasmepsins (Plms) are aspartic proteases involved in the degradation of human hemoglobin by Plasmodium falciparum. Given that the parasite needs the resulting amino acid building blocks for its growth and development, plasmepsins are an important antimalarial drug target. Over the past decade, tremendous progress has been achieved in the development of inhibitors of plasmepsin using two strategies: structure-based drug design (SBDD) and structure-based virtual screening (SBVS). Herein, we review the inhibitors of Plms I-IV developed by SBDD or SBVS with a particular focus on obtaining selectivity versus the human Asp proteases cathepsins and renin and activity in cell-based assays. By use of SBDD, the flap pocket of Plm II has been discovered and constitutes a convenient handle to obtain selectivity. In SBVS, activity against Plms I-IV and selectivity versus cathepsins are not always taken into account. A combination of SBVS, SBDD, and molecular dynamics simulations opens up opportunities for future design cycles.
A new validated bioanalytical method based on LC tandem MS has been developed for the simultaneous extraction and determination of sofosbuvir and ledipasvir in human plasma using antiviral daclatasvir as an internal standard (IS). Liquid-liquid extraction of samples was used for the purification and preconcentration of the analytes from a human plasma matrix. Good and consistent recoveries were obtained, with average extraction recoveries of 91.61 and 88.93% for sofosbuvir and ledipasvir, respectively. The chromatographic separation of the three analytes was achieved within only 2.8 min by an isocratic mobile phase consisting of 10 mM ammonium acetate, which was then adjusted to pH 4.0 by acetic acid-acetonitrile-0.1% methanolic formic acid (12 + 25 + 63, v/v/v) flowing through a C18 Zorbax eclipse plus column (5 μm, 100 × 4.6 mm; Agilent). Multiple reaction monitoring transitions were measured in positive ion mode for sofosbuvir, ledipasvir, and daclatasvir (IS). A detailed validation of the method was performed and the standard curves were found to be linear in the range of 0.5 to 2500 and 5 to 2100 ng/mL for sofosbuvir and ledipasvir, respectively, applying weighted (1/X(2)) linear regression. The developed method was applied to the analysis of the two drugs after a single oral administration of Harvoni 400/90 mg film-coated tablets containing 400 mg sofosbuvir and 90 mg ledipasvir to four healthy volunteers.
Oligosaccharyltransferases (OSTs) mediate the en bloc transfer of N-glycan intermediates onto the asparagine residue in glycosylation sequons (N-X-S/T, X≠P). These enzymes are typically heteromeric complexes composed of several membrane-associated subunits, in which STT3 is highly conserved as a catalytic core. Metazoan organisms encode two STT3 genes (STT3A and STT3B) in their genome, resulting in the formation of at least two distinct OST isoforms consisting of shared subunits and complex specific subunits. The STT3A isoform of OST primarily glycosylates substrate polypeptides cotranslationally, whereas the STT3B isoform is involved in cotranslational and post-translocational glycosylation of sequons that are skipped by the STT3A isoform. Here, we describe mutant constructs of monomeric enhanced green fluorescent protein (mEGFP), which are susceptible to STT3B-dependent N-glycosylation. The endoplasmic reticulum-localized mEGFP (ER-mEGFP) mutants contained an N-glycosylation sequon at their C-terminus and exhibited increased fluorescence in response to N-glycosylation. Isoform-specific glycosylation of the constructs was confirmed by using STT3A- or STT3B-knockout cell lines. Among the mutant constructs that we tested, the ER-mEGFP mutant containing the N185 -C186 -T187 sequon was the best substrate for the STT3B isoform in terms of glycosylation efficiency and fluorescence change. Our results suggest that the mutant ER-mEGFP is useful for monitoring STT3B-dependent post-translocational N-glycosylation in cells of interest, such as those from putative patients with a congenital disorder of glycosylation.
Currently the only approved drug available for the systemic therapy of atopic dermatitis is cyclosporine; however, based on current data from published studies, azathioprine, methotrexate, and mycophenolate mofetil or mycophenolic acid can be administered off-label. Some biologics on the market that have been approved for other indications (ustekinumab, rituximab, tocilizumab) have been successfully used in a few patients with atopic dermatitis. The world's first prospective controlled studies with the biologic human anti-IL4R antibody dupilumab for the indication "atopic dermatitis" were published in 2014. These motivated (1) to extend the studies to dupilumab and (2) to clinically test antagonization of other target molecules of TH2 polarized, atopic inflammation, e.g., IL-13, IL-31, IL-22, TSLP, and CRTH2. A number of clinical trials are currently recruiting in this area and will provide interesting new insights for future therapeutic approaches in atopic dermatitis.
Activated oncogenes induce compensatory tumour-suppressive responses, such as cellular senescence or apoptosis, but the signals determining the main outcome remain to be fully understood. Here, we uncover a role for Cdk2 (cyclin-dependent kinase 2) in suppressing Myc-induced senescence. Short-term activation of Myc promoted cell-cycle progression in either wild-type or Cdk2 knockout mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs). In the knockout MEFs, however, the initial hyper-proliferative response was followed by cellular senescence. Loss of Cdk2 also caused sensitization to Myc-induced senescence in pancreatic beta-cells or splenic B-cells in vivo, correlating with delayed lymphoma onset in the latter. Cdk2-/- MEFs also senesced upon ectopic Wnt signalling or, without an oncogene, upon oxygen-induced culture shock. Myc also causes senescence in cells lacking the DNA repair protein Wrn. However, unlike loss of Wrn, loss of Cdk2 did not enhance Myc-induced replication stress, implying that these proteins suppress senescence through different routes. In MEFs, Myc-induced senescence was genetically dependent on the ARF-p53-p21Cip1 and p16INK4a-pRb pathways, p21Cip1 and p16INK4a being selectively induced in Cdk2-/- cells. Thus, although redundant for cell-cycle progression and development, Cdk2 has a unique role in suppressing oncogene- and/or stress-induced senescence. Pharmacological inhibition of Cdk2 induced Myc-dependent senescence in various cell types, including a p53-null human cancer cell line. Our data warrant re-assessment of Cdk2 as a therapeutic target in Myc- or Wnt-driven tumours.
BACKGROUND: The proteasome inhibitor bortezomib represents an important advance in the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM). Bortezomib inhibits the activity of the 26S proteasome and induces cell death in a variety of tumor cells; however, the mechanism of cytotoxicity is not well understood.METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We investigated the differential phosphoproteome upon proteasome inhibition by using stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) in combination with phosphoprotein enrichment and LC-MS/MS analysis. In total 233 phosphoproteins were identified and 72 phosphoproteins showed a 1.5-fold or greater change upon bortezomib treatment. The phosphoproteins with expression alterations encompass all major protein classes, including a large number of nucleic acid binding proteins. Site-specific phosphopeptide quantitation revealed that Ser38 phosphorylation on stathmin increased upon bortezomib treatment, suggesting new mechanisms associated to bortezomib-induced apoptosis in MM cells. Further studies demonstrated that stathmin phosphorylation profile was modified in response to bortezomib treatment and the regulation of stathmin by phosphorylation at specific Ser/Thr residues participated in the cellular response induced by bortezomib.CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our systematic profiling of phosphorylation changes in response to bortezomib treatment not only advanced the global mechanistic understanding of the action of bortezomib on myeloma cells but also identified previously uncharacterized signaling proteins in myeloma cells.
"Corkscrew oesophagus" is characterised on the basis of two case reports and attention is drawn to thoracic pain of oesophageal origin. Corkscrew oesophagus is a radiological diagnosis and is characterised by twisted segments in the distal third of the oesophagus. The condition can sometimes be demonstrated endoscopically and it is due to a basic disturbance in the motility of the oesophagus. Painful conditions in the oesophagus are most frequently caused by gastro-oesophageal reflux or disturbances in motility and the latter is frequently complicated by reflux oesophagitis. Pain of oesophageal origin is frequently a diagnosis by exclusion and requires exclusion of ischaemic heart disease. The initial treatment should be directed to the reflux oesophagitis. The diagnosis and information about the origin of the pain and the benign course of the condition will calm the majority of the patients and remove their fear of a possible fatal heart disease.
Parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5) is a member of the Paramyxoviridae family of membrane-enveloped viruses with a negative-sense RNA genome that is packaged and protected by long filamentous nucleocapsid-helix structures (RNPs). These RNPs, consisting of ∼2,600 protomers of nucleocapsid (N) protein, form the template for viral transcription and replication. We have determined the 3D X-ray crystal structure of the nucleoprotein (N)-RNA complex from PIV5 to 3.11-Å resolution. The structure reveals a 13-mer nucleocapsid ring whose diameter, cavity, and pitch/height dimensions agree with EM data from early studies on the Paramyxovirinae subfamily of native RNPs, indicating that it closely represents one-turn in the building block of the RNP helices. The PIV5-N nucleocapsid ring encapsidates a nuclease resistant 78-nt RNA strand in its positively charged groove formed between the N-terminal (NTD) and C-terminal (CTD) domains of its successive N protomers. Six nucleotides precisely are associated with each N protomer, with alternating three-base-in three-base-out conformation. The binding of six nucleotides per protomer is consistent with the "rule of six" that governs the genome packaging of the Paramyxovirinae subfamily of viruses. PIV5-N protomer subdomains are very similar in structure to the previously solved Nipah-N structure, but with a difference in the angle between NTD/CTD at the RNA hinge region. Based on the Nipah-N structure we modeled a PIV5-N open conformation in which the CTD rotates away from the RNA strand into the inner spacious nucleocapsid-ring cavity. This rotation would expose the RNA for the viral polymerase activity without major disruption of the nucleocapsid structure.
A strong chronic induction of the SOS response system occurs in E. coli BW535, a strain defective in nth, nfo and xth genes, and hence severely deficient in the repair of abasic sites in DNA. This was shown here by visualization of filamentous growth of the BW535 strain and by measuring the level of beta-galactosidase expressed in BW535/pSK1002 in comparison to the AB1157/pSK1002 strain. The plasmid pSK1002 bears an umuC::lacZ fusion in which lacZ is under the control of the umuC promoter and regulated under the SOS regulon. Increases in the expression of beta-galactosidase occur in BW535 without any exogenous SOS inducer. Chronic induction of the SOS response was observed previously in E. coli strains bearing mutations in certain genes that have mutator activity and BW535 is a moderate mutator strain. However, not all mutators show this property, since chronic induction of SOS was not observed in mutT or mutY mutators. MutT and MutY proteins, when active, protect bacteria from mutations induced by 8-oxoG lesions in DNA. This suggests that accumulation of abasic sites, but not 8-oxoG residues in DNA, induce the SOS response.
BACKGROUND: Prediction of the transmembrane strands and topology of beta-barrel outer membrane proteins is of interest in current bioinformatics research. Several methods have been applied so far for this task, utilizing different algorithmic techniques and a number of freely available predictors exist. The methods can be grossly divided to those based on Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), on Neural Networks (NNs) and on Support Vector Machines (SVMs). In this work, we compare the different available methods for topology prediction of beta-barrel outer membrane proteins. We evaluate their performance on a non-redundant dataset of 20 beta-barrel outer membrane proteins of gram-negative bacteria, with structures known at atomic resolution. Also, we describe, for the first time, an effective way to combine the individual predictors, at will, to a single consensus prediction method.RESULTS: We assess the statistical significance of the performance of each prediction scheme and conclude that Hidden Markov Model based methods, HMM-B2TMR, ProfTMB and PRED-TMBB, are currently the best predictors, according to either the per-residue accuracy, the segments overlap measure (SOV) or the total number of proteins with correctly predicted topologies in the test set. Furthermore, we show that the available predictors perform better when only transmembrane beta-barrel domains are used for prediction, rather than the precursor full-length sequences, even though the HMM-based predictors are not influenced significantly. The consensus prediction method performs significantly better than each individual available predictor, since it increases the accuracy up to 4% regarding SOV and up to 15% in correctly predicted topologies.CONCLUSIONS: The consensus prediction method described in this work, optimizes the predicted topology with a dynamic programming algorithm and is implemented in a web-based application freely available to non-commercial users at http://bioinformatics.biol.uoa.gr/ConBBPRED.
In angiosperms the strictly light-dependent reduction of protochlorophyllide to chlorophyllide is catalyzed by NADPH:protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (POR). The Arabidopsis thaliana genome encodes three structurally related but differentially regulated POR genes, PORA, PORB and PORC. PORA is expressed primarily early in development-during etiolation, germination and greening. In contrast, PORB and PORC are not only expressed during seedling development but also throughout the later life of the plant, during which they are responsible for bulk chlorophyll synthesis. The Arabidopsis porB-1 porC-1 mutant displays a severe xantha (highly chlorophyll-deficient) phenotype characterized by smaller prolamellar bodies in etioplasts and decreased thylakoid stacking in chloroplasts. Here we have demonstrated the ability of an ectopic PORA overexpression construct to restore prolamellar body formation in the porB-1 porC-1 double mutant background. In response to illumination, light-dependent chlorophyll production, thylakoid stacking and photomorphogenesis are also restored in PORA-overexpressing porB-1 porC-1 seedlings and adult plants. An Arabidopsis porB-1 porC-1 double mutant can therefore be functionally rescued by the addition of ectopically expressed PORA, which suffices in the absence of either PORB or PORC to direct bulk chlorophyll synthesis and normal plant development.
BACKGROUND: Tobacco smoking is a major cause of preventable disease and premature death. Physicians should play an active role in the control of smoking by encouraging cessation and helping the smoker to choose the most suitable aid to cessation.AIM: To evaluate a simple, ear acupuncture treatment for the cessation of smoking.METHOD: Randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 78 currently smoking volunteers from the general public. Volunteers attended an acupuncture clinic in a general practice setting and were given a single treatment of electroacupuncture using two needles at either an active or a placebo site plus self-retained ear seeds for two weeks. The major outcome measure was biochemically validated total cessation of smoking at six months.RESULTS: A total of 12.5% of the active treatment group compared with 0% of the placebo group ceased smoking at six months (P = 0.055, 95% confidence interval -0.033 to 0.323).CONCLUSION: This simple ear electroacupuncture treatment was significantly more effective in helping volunteers to quit smoking than placebo treatment.
Clinical trials to support registration of new drugs are arduous, lengthy, and expensive. Diabetes treatment trials intended to seek indications for glycemic control are facilitated by the regulatory acceptance of glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C) as a validated intermediate efficacy end point. However, A1C outcomes are not meaningful when taken outside of the context of hypoglycemia risks. Current regulatory guidance indicates that A1C efficacy end points and hypoglycemia safety end points be considered separately. A composite end point for diabetes treatment trials that integrates A1C and hypoglycemia risk into a single measure is proposed. An example would be "percentage of patients achieving A1C <7% without unacceptable hypoglycemia." The benefits and limitations of such an approach are discussed.
Reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced cardiac cell injury via expression changes of multiple genes plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of numerous heart diseases. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) comprise a novel class of endogenous, small, noncoding RNAs that negatively regulate about 30% of the genes in a cell via degradation or translational inhibition of their target mRNAs. Currently, the effects of ROS on miRNA expression and the roles of miRNAs in ROS-mediated injury on cardiac myocytes are uncertain. Using quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR), we demonstrated that microRNA-21 (miR-21) was upregulated in cardiac myocytes after treatment with hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)). To determine the potential roles of miRNAs in H(2)O(2)-mediated gene regulation and cellular injury, miR-21 expression was downregulated by miR-21 inhibitor and upregulated by pre-miR-21. H(2)O(2)-induced cardiac cell death and apoptosis were increased by miR-21 inhibitor and was decreased by pre-miR-21. Programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4) that was regulated by miR-21 and was a direct target of miR-21 in cardiac myocytes. Pre-miR-21-mediated protective effect on cardiac myocyte injury was inhibited in H(2)O(2)-treated cardiac cells via adenovirus-mediated overexpression of PDCD4 without miR-21 binding site. Moreover, Activator protein 1 (AP-1) was a downstream signaling molecule of PDCD4 that was involved in miR-21-mediated effect on cardiac myocytes. The results suggest that miR-21 is sensitive to H(2)O(2) stimulation. miR-21 participates in H(2)O(2)-mediated gene regulation and functional modulation in cardiac myocytes. miR-21 might play an essential role in heart diseases related to ROS such as cardiac hypertrophy, heart failure, myocardial infarction, and myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury.
Obesity is commonly associated with development of insulin resistance and systemic evidence of inflammation. Macrophages contribute to inflammatory amplification in obesity and may contribute directly to insulin resistance and the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease through the production of inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. To test this hypothesis, we transplanted male wild-type (WT) and TNF-alpha deficient (KO) mice with either TNF-alpha-sufficient (TNF-alpha(+/+)) or TNF-alpha-deficient (TNF-alpha(-/-)) bone marrow. After consuming a high-fat diet for 26 wk, metabolic and morphometric characteristics of the animals were analyzed. While there were no differences in terms of relative weight gain, body composition analysis yielded a lower relative adipose and higher relative lean mass in mice lacking TNF-alpha, which was partially explained by reduced epididymal fat pad and liver weight. TNF-alpha(-/-) -->KO mice exhibited enhanced insulin sensitivity compared with that observed in TNF-alpha(+/+)-->KO mice; remarkably, no protection against insulin resistance was provided by transplanting TNF-alpha(-/-) bone marrow in WT mice compared with TNF-alpha(+/+)-->WT. The preserved insulin sensitivity seen in TNF-alpha(-/-)-->KO mice provided protection against the development of hepatic steatosis. Taken together, these data indicate that macrophage-derived TNF-alpha contributes to the pattern and extent of fat accumulation and insulin resistance in diet-induced obesity; however, this contribution is negligible in the presence of host-derived TNF-alpha.
We report a girl who had Hirschsprung disease in association with distinct facial appearance, microcephaly, agenesis of the corpus callosum and mental retardation (Mowat-Wilson syndrome). Mutation analysis of the zinc finger homeo box 1 B (ZFHX1 B) gene revealed a de novo 7 bp deletion (TGGCCCC) at nucleotide 1773 (1773 delTGGCCCC) resulting in a frameshift and leading to a termination codon at amino acid residue 604 (604 X) in exon 8 C. The zinc finger homeo box 1 B (Smad interacting protein-1) is a transcription corepressor of Smad target genes with functions in the patterning of neural crest derived cells, CNS, and midline structures. Mutations in ZFHX1 B can lead to neurological disorders in addition to dysmorphic features, megacolon, and other malformations.
Functional links connecting gene transcription and condensin-mediated chromosome condensation have been established in species ranging from prokaryotes to vertebrates. However, the exact nature of these links remains misunderstood. Here we show in fission yeast that the 3' end RNA processing factor Swd2.2, a component of the Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factor (CPF), is a negative regulator of condensin-mediated chromosome condensation. Lack of Swd2.2 does not affect the assembly of the CPF but reduces its association with chromatin. This causes only limited, context-dependent effects on gene expression and transcription termination. However, CPF-associated Swd2.2 is required for the association of Protein Phosphatase 1 PP1(Dis2) with chromatin, through an interaction with Ppn1, a protein that we identify as the fission yeast homologue of vertebrate PNUTS. We demonstrate that Swd2.2, Ppn1 and PP1Dis2 form an independent module within the CPF, which provides an essential function in the absence of the CPF-associated Ssu72 phosphatase. We show that Ppn1 and Ssu72, like Swd2.2, are also negative regulators of condensin-mediated chromosome condensation. We conclude that Swd2.2 opposes condensin-mediated chromosome condensation by facilitating the function of the two CPF-associated phosphatases PP1 and Ssu72.
INTRODUCTION: Wellens Syndrome (WS) is a condition characterized by typical changes in ECG, which are biphasic T-wave inversions (less common) or symmetric and deeply inverted T waves (including 75%) in lead V2-V3 chest derivations. WS is considered important because it has not only diagnostic value but also prognostic value.CASE REPORT: A 52-year-old male patient without cardiovascular disease or risk factors was admitted to the emergency department (ED) suffering with chest pain and syncope, just after having been involved in a discussion at work. Chest pain was radiating to the left arm and was not precipitated by exertion. Shortness of breath was not accompanied by angina. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization at Department of Cardiology. Stents were positioned in both LADA and a severe lesion in the left main coronary artery. The patient was discharged two days following catheterization, due to no chest pain and hemodynamic instability during the hospitalization. The patient has approved the inform consent for to be used for this case report.
Titin is the largest protein in mammals; it forms an elastic filament along the myofibril of cardiac and skeletal muscles. Novel studies employing the recently available varied technologies have revealed the molecular mechanisms by which titin generates passive force in the sarcomere in response to external stretch. Changes in titin stiffness occur during heart disease via a shift in the expression ratio of the two main titin isoforms, called N2B (stiff type) and N2BA (compliant type) titins. Protein kinase (PK)A, PKG and PKC phosphorylate the cardiac specific I-band titin segment, resulting in an acute decrease (by PKA and PKG) or increase (by PKC) in passive force. It has also been discovered that titin performs roles that go beyond passive force generation, by enhancing or terminating active force production, thereby adjusting the Frank-Starling mechanism of the heart. Therefore, titin is a self-adjustable and multi-functional spring that is indispensable for proper heart functions. Here, we discuss how titin regulates the passive and active properties of cardiac muscle in normal physiological conditions as well as in chronic heart disease.
BACKGROUND: RET germline mutations predispose to the development of inherited cancer syndrome multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2). Several variants of the RET proto-oncogene including G691S and S904S have been suggested to act as genetic modifiers at the age of onset ofMEN2.AIM: The aim of this study is to characterize clinically and molecularly 7 Cypriot patients with familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC) and 1 with MEN2A and also to determine the allelic frequencies of the RET variants G691S and S904S.SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Seven probands from FMTC families and 1 from MEN2A were screened for the presence of RET mutations and the G691S and S904S variants. Additionally, 226 healthy Cypriots, who served as controls were analysed in an attempt to compare the frequencies of G691S and S904S RET variants to those observed in the 8 patients.RESULTS: The clinical diagnosis of the probands was based on clinical presentation and supported with biochemical findings. The germline C618R mutation of exon 10 was identified in all 8 probands and in 15 relatives from 7 different families. No significant difference in the G691S/S904S variants allele frequencies between patients (4/16 or 25%) and controls (124/452 or 27.4%) was found.CONCLUSIONS: Mutational screening of the RET gene identified a common mutation (C618R) in all 8 (7 FMTC and 1 MEN2A) unrelated Cypriot patients which may be explained by a founder effect. Additionally, no association of the G691S/S904S variants was linked with the disease.
Telomeres are highly regulated and dynamic complexes that protect the genomic DNA and prevent the end of linear chromosomes from being misrecognized as a broken DNA. Due to the end replication problem, telomeres of somatic cells shorten with each cell division, inducing cell senescence. Telomerase is a reverse transcriptase capable of compensating telomere attrition by adding telomere repeats to the ends of chromosomes. Human telomeres are associated with the shelterin complex which consists of six telomere-associated proteins that specifically bind to telomeric DNA. Alterations or removal of individual shelterin components would lead to telomere uncapping and telomere dysfunction, resulting in cellular senescence and transformation to a malignant state. Another complex of multifunctional proteins, named non-shelterin complex, is thought to prevent telomere degradation and facilitate telomerase-based telomere elongation. As telomerase is highly expressed in most human tumor cells, it is considered an attractive target for new therapeutic strategies. In this review, we will summarize the characteristics of telomeres and telomerase in lymphoid malignancies and discuss the role of telomere-associated proteins in these entities.
Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by an expansion in the trinucleotide CAG repeat in exon-1 in the huntingtin gene, located on chromosome 4. When the number of trinucleotide CAG exceeds 40 repeats, disease invariably is manifested, characterized by motor, cognitive, and psychiatric symptoms. The huntingtin (Htt) protein and its mutant form (mutant huntingtin, mHtt) are ubiquitously expressed but although multiple brain regions are affected, the most vulnerable brain region is the striatum. Striatal medium-sized spiny neurons (MSNs) preferentially degenerate, followed by the cortical pyramidal neurons located in layers V and VI. Proposed HD pathogenic mechanisms include, but are not restricted to, excitotoxicity, neurotrophic support deficits, collapse of the protein degradation mechanisms, mitochondrial dysfunction, transcriptional alterations, and disorders of myelin. Studies performed in cell type-specific and regionally selective HD mouse models implicate both MSN cell-autonomous properties and cell-cell interactions, particularly corticostriatal but also with non-neuronal cell types. Here, we review the intrinsic properties of MSNs that contribute to their selective vulnerability and in addition, we discuss how astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes, together with aberrant corticostriatal connectivity, contribute to HD pathophysiology. In addition, mHtt causes cell-autonomous dysfunction in cell types other than MSNs. These findings have implications in terms of therapeutic strategies aimed at preventing neuronal dysfunction and degeneration.
Selenium may affect prostate cancer risk via its plasma carrier selenoprotein P which shows dramatically reduced expression in prostate cancer tumors and cell lines. The selenoprotein P (SEPP1) Ala234 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) allele is associated with lower plasma selenoprotein P in men, reducing the concentration/activity of other antioxidant selenoproteins. Selenium status also modifies the effect of the mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (SOD2) SNP Ala16Val on prostate cancer risk. We investigated the relationship of these SNPs with prostate cancer risk. DNA from 2,975 cases and 1,896 age-matched controls from the population-based Prostate Cancer in Sweden study were genotyped using TaqMan assays. Cases were designated aggressive or nonaggressive prostate cancers at diagnosis by clinical criteria. Association with prostate cancer was investigated by logistic regression; gene-gene interaction using a general linear model. The mean plasma selenium concentration measured in 169 controls was relatively low (76.0 +/- 17.2 microg/L). SNP genotype distributions were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. SOD2-Ala16+ men were at a greater risk of prostate cancer [odds ratios (OR), 1.19; 95% confidence intervals (CI), 1.03-1.37] compared with SOD2-Val16 homozygotes. Men homozygous for SEPP1-Ala234 who were also SOD2-Ala16+ had a higher risk of prostate cancer (OR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.17-1.76) and aggressive prostate cancer (OR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.22-2.09) than those who were SOD2-Val16 homozygotes (interaction, prostate cancer P = 0.05; aggressive prostate cancer P = 0.01). This interaction was stronger in ever-smokers: SOD2-Ala16+ men homozygous for SEPP1-Ala234 had an almost doubled risk of prostate cancer (OR, 1.97; 95% CI, 1.33-2.91; interaction P = 0.001). In a low-selenium population, SOD2-Ala16+ men homozygous for SEPP1-Ala234 are at an increased risk of prostate cancer/aggressive prostate cancer especially if ever-smokers, because they are likely to produce more mitochondrial H(2)O(2) that they cannot remove, thereby promoting prostate tumor cell proliferation and migration.
Renal α-Klotho (α-KL) plays a fundamental role as a co-receptor for fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), a phosphaturic hormone and regulator of 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D3 (1,25VitD3). Disruption of FGF23-α-KL signaling is thought to be an early hallmark of chronic kidney disease (CKD) involving reduced renal α-KL expression and a reciprocal rise in serum FGF23. It remains unclear, however, whether the rise in FGF23 is related to the loss of renal α-KL. We evaluated α-KL expression in renal biopsy samples and measured levels of several parameters of mineral metabolism, as well as soluble α-KL (sKL), in serum and urinary samples from CKD patients (n = 236). We found that although renal α-KL levels were significantly reduced and serum FGF23 levels were significantly elevated in early and intermediate CKD, serum phosphate levels remained within the normal range. Multiple regression analysis showed that the increases in FGF23 were significantly associated with reduced renal function and elevated serum phosphate, but were not associated with loss of renal α-KL. Moreover, despite falling renal α-KL levels, the increase in FGF23 enhanced urinary fractional excretion of phosphate and reduced serum 1,25VitD3 levels in early and intermediate CKD, though not in advanced CKD. Serum sKL levels also fell significantly over the course of CKD, and renal α-KL was a significant independent determinant of sKL. These results demonstrate that FGF23 levels rise to compensate for renal failure-related phosphate retention in early and intermediate CKD. This enables FGF23-α-KL signaling and a neutral phosphate balance to be maintained despite the reduction in α-KL. In advanced CKD, however, renal α-KL declines further. This disrupts FGF23 signaling, and serum phosphate levels significantly increase, stimulating greater FGF23 secretion. Our results also suggest the serum sKL concentration may be a useful marker of renal α-KL expression levels.
Normal cell function is dependent on the proper maintenance of chromatin structure. Regulation of chromatin structure is controlled by histone modifications that directly influence chromatin architecture and genome function. Specifically, the histone deacetylase (HDAC) family of proteins modulate chromatin compaction and are commonly dysregulated in many tumors, including colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the role of HDAC proteins in early colorectal carcinogenesis has not been previously reported. We found HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3, HDAC5, and HDAC7 all to be up-regulated in the field of human CRC. Furthermore, we observed that HDAC2 up-regulation is one of the earliest events in CRC carcinogenesis and observed this in human field carcinogenesis, the azoxymethane-treated rat model, and in more aggressive colon cancer cell lines. The universality of HDAC2 up-regulation suggests that HDAC2 up-regulation is a novel and important early event in CRC, which may serve as a biomarker. HDAC inhibitors (HDACIs) interfere with tumorigenic HDAC activity; however, the precise mechanisms involved in this process remain to be elucidated. We confirmed that HDAC inhibition by valproic acid (VPA) targeted the more aggressive cell line. Using nuclease digestion assays and transmission electron microscopy imaging, we observed that VPA treatment induced greater changes in chromatin structure in the more aggressive cell line. Furthermore, we used the novel imaging technique partial wave spectroscopy (PWS) to quantify nanoscale alterations in chromatin. We noted that the PWS results are consistent with the biological assays, indicating a greater effect of VPA treatment in the more aggressive cell type. Together, these results demonstrate the importance of HDAC activity in early carcinogenic events and the unique role of higher-order chromatin structure in determining cell tumorigenicity.
OBJECTIVE: Conventional treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and lupus nephritis (LN) is associated with damage accrual, hence increased morbidity rate. Off-label use of rituximab (RTX) has shown significant promise in this patient group; however, data are still controversial. We aimed to analyze the outcomes of RTX therapy in refractory lupus using a meta-analysis approach.METHODS: Electronic search of the medical literature was conducted using a combination of relevant keywords to retrieve studies on the safety and efficacy of RTX in SLE and LN patients. Results were screened against our inclusion and exclusion criteria and two reviewers independently extracted the data for analysis. Comprehensive meta-analysis software was used to pool the data from individual studies and provide summary effect estimates.RESULTS: Thirty-one studies that enrolled 1112 patients were finally eligible for the meta-analysis. The overall global, complete, and partial response rates to RTX therapy were 72%, 46%, and 32%, respectively. RTX significantly decreased Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) and British Isles Lupus Activity Group (BILAG) scores (p<0.001). Prednisone dose was significantly reduced after RTX treatment in both SLE and LN groups (p<0.001), and proteinuria was lowered in SLE (p<0.001) than in LN patients (p=0.07). Infection and infusion-related reactions were the most common side effects.CONCLUSION: RTX therapy in refractory SLE and LN patients proved clinical efficacy and favorable safety outcomes. Larger well-designed randomized clinical trials are warranted.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the third known animal coronavirus, after severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The mean age of the infected patients was estimated to be between 50 and 69 years old. Accordingly, the COVID-19 mortality rate was calculated as 15%. In this regard, the essential component of prevention and planning is knowledge of laboratory and demographic findings among COVID-19 patients; therefore, the present study was conducted to investigate laboratory and demographic findings among these patients worldwide. This systematic review was performed on the articles published in English between January 1, 2019 and May 4, 2020, using MeSH-compliant keywords such as "COVID-19", "Laboratory, coronavirus disease-19 testing", and " demography " in international databases (PubMed, and web of science Scopus). Thereafter, the articles relevant to laboratory and demographic findings among COVID-19 patients were included in the final review. Reviewing the included articles showed changes in the mean lymphocytes count ranged from 0.7 to 39 in hospital or severe cases. Moreover, Leukopenia was not observed in patients with thrombocytopenia. In addition, C-reactive protein (CRP), leukocytes, D-dimer, FDP, FIB, neutrophils, AST, serum creatinine, t-troponin, troponin I, and blood bilirubin levels showed increasing trends in most studies conducted on COVID-19 patients. Notably, the elevated LDH level was more common among children than adults. According to the results of the present study, and by considering the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients on the one hand, and considering the changes in laboratory samples such as lymphocytes and other blood markers due to the damaged myocardial, hepatic, and renal tissues on the other hand, it is recommended to confirm the diagnosis of this infection by evaluating the patients' blood samples using other diagnostic methods like lung scan.
OBJECTIVES: It has been shown that calcitriol and all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) have modulatory effects on the immune system. The present study investigates the synergistic effects of combination treatment of calcitriol and ATRA in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS).METHODS: The mice were allocated to four preventive groups, each consisting of eight animals, ATRA (250 μg/mouse), calcitriol (100 ng/mouse), combination of ATRA and calcitriol (125  μg/mouse and 50 ng/mouse) and vehicle groups. EAE was induced by MOG35-55 peptide in female C57BL/6 mice. Treatments were initiated at day 1 before immunization and continued every other day throughout the study until the day 21 post-immunization. Splenocytes were isolated from EAE-induced mice and the expression of retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor gamma t (ROR-γt), Interleukin-17 (IL-17), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), and forkhead box P3 (FOXP3) genes was measured using real-time polymerase chain reaction.RESULTS: The expression of FOXP3 and TGF-β genes in the splenocytes of combination-treated and calcitriol alone-treated mice was significantly increased compared to vehicle group (P < 0.05). The expression of ROR-γt and IL-17 genes in the splenocytes of ATRA, calcitriol and combination- treated mice was significantly reduced compared to those of vehicle- treated mice (P < 0.05). The relative expression level of ROR-γt was significantly (P < 0.05) lower in the combination group than in the mice treated by ATRA or calcitriol alone.DISCUSSION: This study demonstrated that treatment with combination of calcitriol and ATRA can be considered as a new strategy for MS prevention and treatment.
Marine pufferfish generally contain a large amount of tetrodotoxin (TTX) in their skin and viscera, and have caused many incidences of food poisoning, especially in Japan. Edible species and body tissues of pufferfish, as well as their allowable fishing areas, are therefore clearly stipulated in Japan, but still 2 to 3 people die every year due to pufferfish poisoning. TTX is originally produced by marine bacteria, and pufferfish are intoxicated through the food chain that starts with the bacteria. Pufferfish become nontoxic when fed TTX-free diets in a closed environment in which there is no possible invasion of TTX-bearing organisms. On the other hand, TTX poisoning due to marine snails has recently spread through Japan, China, Taiwan, and Europe. In addition, TTX poisoning of dogs due to the ingestion of sea slugs was recently reported in New Zealand. TTX in these gastropods also seems to be exogenous; carnivorous large snails are intoxicated by eating toxic starfish, and necrophagous small-to-medium snails, the viscera of dead pufferfish after spawning. Close attention must be paid to the geographic expansion and/or diversification of TTX-bearing organisms, and to the sudden occurrence of other forms of TTX poisoning due to their ingestion.
An active replication complex of citrus exocortis viroid (CEV) was isolated as a chromatin-enriched fraction of infected tomato leaf with CEV RNA synthesis activity. This activity was solubilised from the chromatin with ammonium sulphate, but not with sarkosyl. Nucleoprotein complexes in the soluble fraction which bound to a monoclonal antibody to the carboxy terminal domain of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (8WG16) were affinity purified and contained plus- and minus-sense CEV RNA. The results support a role for RNA polymerase II in viroid replication and provide the first direct evidence of an association in vivo between host RNA polymerase II and CEV.
GATA-1 and the ets factor PU.1 have been reported to functionally antagonize one another in the regulation of erythroid versus myeloid gene transcription and development. The CCAAT enhancer binding protein epsilon (C/EBPepsilon) is expressed as multiple isoforms and has been shown to be essential to myeloid (granulocyte) terminal differentiation. We have defined a novel synergistic, as opposed to antagonistic, combinatorial interaction between GATA-1 and PU.1, and a unique repressor role for certain C/EBPepsilon isoforms in the transcriptional regulation of a model eosinophil granulocyte gene, the major basic protein (MBP). The eosinophil-specific P2 promoter of the MBP gene contains GATA-1, C/EBP, and PU.1 consensus sites that bind these factors in nuclear extracts of the eosinophil myelocyte cell line, AML14.3D10. The promoter is transactivated by GATA-1 alone but is synergistically transactivated by low levels of PU.1 in the context of optimal levels of GATA-1. The C/EBPepsilon(27) isoform strongly represses GATA-1 activity and completely blocks GATA-1/PU.1 synergy. In vitro mutational analyses of the MBP-P2 promoter showed that both the GATA-1/PU.1 synergy, and repressor activity of C/EBPepsilon(27) are mediated via protein-protein interactions through the C/EBP and/or GATA-binding sites but not the PU.1 sites. Co-immunoprecipitations using lysates of AML14.3D10 eosinophils show that both C/EBPepsilon(32/30) and epsilon(27) physically interact in vivo with PU.1 and GATA-1, demonstrating functional interactions among these factors in eosinophil progenitors. Our findings identify novel combinatorial protein-protein interactions for GATA-1, PU.1, and C/EBPepsilon isoforms in eosinophil gene transcription that include GATA-1/PU.1 synergy and repressor activity for C/EBPepsilon(27).
Uncontrolled cellular proliferation, mediated by dysregulation of the cell-cycle machinery and activation of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) to promote cell-cycle progression, lies at the heart of cancer as a pathological process. Clinical implementation of first-generation, nonselective CDK inhibitors, designed to inhibit this proliferation, was originally hampered by the high risk of toxicity and lack of efficacy noted with these agents. The emergence of a new generation of selective CDK4/6 inhibitors, including ribociclib, abemaciclib and palbociclib, has enabled tumour types in which CDK4/6 has a pivotal role in the G1-to-S-phase cell-cycle transition to be targeted with improved effectiveness, and fewer adverse effects. Results of pivotal phase III trials investigating palbociclib in patients with advanced-stage oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer have demonstrated a substantial improvement in progression-free survival, with a well-tolerated toxicity profile. Mechanisms of acquired resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors are beginning to emerge that, although unwelcome, might enable rational post-CDK4/6 inhibitor therapeutic strategies to be identified. Extending the use of CDK4/6 inhibitors beyond ER-positive breast cancer is challenging, and will likely require biomarkers that are predictive of a response, and the use of combination therapies in order to optimize CDK4/6 targeting.
Craniosynostosis caused by genetic factors includes a heterogeneous group of over 100 syndromes, most with autosomal dominant inheritance. Mutations in five genes (FGFR1-, -2, -3, TWIST, and MSX2) causing craniosynostosis as the main clinical feature were described. In most of these conditions, there are also limb malformations. We report a two-generation kindred segregating microcornea, optic nerve alterations and cataract since childhood, craniosynostosis, and distal limb alterations, with a great clinical intrafamilial variability. The ophthalmological problems here described seem to be unique to this genealogy while similar feet alterations were apparently only described in two other affected siblings with acro-cranial-facial dysostosis syndrome (ADS). However, ADS has an autosomal recessive inheritance instead of the dominant pattern of the present genealogy. The candidate exons of the five genes previously mentioned were tested through sequencing analysis presenting normal results in all cases. Therefore, clinical and laboratory analyses in our patients suggest that their phenotype represents a new syndrome very likely caused by mutation in a gene different from those studied.
Tamoxifen was approved for breast cancer prevention in October 1998. Thus, for the first time, we as gynecologists are being asked to prescribe this drug to healthy women. In the past each one of us has cared for women with breast cancer who have been treated with tamoxifen by oncologists or breast surgeons for the malignancy. Effects of tamoxifen on the uterus resulting in carcinomas, hyperplasia, and polyps are well known. Furthermore, tamoxifen has estrogenic properties in the venous system, increasing the incidence of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary emboli. A new SERM (selective estrogen receptor modulator), raloxifene, has been approved for prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. It does not have stimulatory effects on the endometrium; however, it is estrogenic in the venous system. Preclinical data, as well as the breast cancer incidence reported in studies of the skeleton, seem to indicate that its effects in the breast are similar to those of tamoxifen. This article reviews tamoxifen and the new SERM, raloxifene, in an attempt to help gynecologists better understand each compound and what data are currently known, what we hope to learn from future studies, and what currently makes sense for clinical practice.
PANTHER-PSEP is a new software tool for predicting non-synonymous genetic variants that may play a causal role in human disease. Several previous variant pathogenicity prediction methods have been proposed that quantify evolutionary conservation among homologous proteins from different organisms. PANTHER-PSEP employs a related but distinct metric based on 'evolutionary preservation': homologous proteins are used to reconstruct the likely sequences of ancestral proteins at nodes in a phylogenetic tree, and the history of each amino acid can be traced back in time from its current state to estimate how long that state has been preserved in its ancestors. Here, we describe the PSEP tool, and assess its performance on standard benchmarks for distinguishing disease-associated from neutral variation in humans. On these benchmarks, PSEP outperforms not only previous tools that utilize evolutionary conservation, but also several highly used tools that include multiple other sources of information as well. For predicting pathogenic human variants, the trace back of course starts with a human 'reference' protein sequence, but the PSEP tool can also be applied to predicting deleterious or pathogenic variants in reference proteins from any of the ∼100 other species in the PANTHER database.AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: PANTHER-PSEP is freely available on the web at http://pantherdb.org/tools/csnpScoreForm.jsp Users can also download the command-line based tool at ftp://ftp.pantherdb.org/cSNP_analysis/PSEP/ CONTACT: pdthomas@usc.eduSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
The first German family with autosomal dominant Emery-Dreifuss syndrome (EDS) is described, with electrophysiologic and myopathologic results providing evidence of a primary neurogenic disease. According to classification of the scapulo peroneal syndrome without cardiomyopathy, we conclude that there are two variants of EDS: one myopathic, the other neurogenic in origin. Therefore, the term Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy should be avoided. Instead, each case of EDS should be classified as myopathic or neurogenic with X chromosome recessive or autosomal dominant inheritance.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emerged in 2002 as a highly transmissible pathogenic human betacoronavirus. The viral spike glycoprotein (S) utilizes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a host protein receptor and mediates fusion of the viral and host membranes, making S essential to viral entry into host cells and host species tropism. As SARS-CoV enters host cells, the viral S is believed to undergo a number of conformational transitions as it is cleaved by host proteases and binds to host receptors. We recently developed stabilizing mutations for coronavirus spikes that prevent the transition from the pre-fusion to post-fusion states. Here, we present cryo-EM analyses of a stabilized trimeric SARS-CoV S, as well as the trypsin-cleaved, stabilized S, and its interactions with ACE2. Neither binding to ACE2 nor cleavage by trypsin at the S1/S2 cleavage site impart large conformational changes within stabilized SARS-CoV S or expose the secondary cleavage site, S2'.
Epidermal melanocytes play an important role in protecting the skin from UV rays, and their functional impairment results in pigment disorders. Additionally, melanomas are considered to arise from mutations that accumulate in melanocyte stem cells. The mechanisms underlying melanocyte differentiation and the defining characteristics of melanocyte stem cells in humans are, however, largely unknown. In the present study, we set out to generate melanocytes from human iPS cells in vitro, leading to a preliminary investigation of the mechanisms of human melanocyte differentiation. We generated iPS cell lines from human dermal fibroblasts using the Yamanaka factors (SOX2, OCT3/4, and KLF4, with or without c-MYC). These iPS cell lines were subsequently used to form embryoid bodies (EBs) and then differentiated into melanocytes via culture supplementation with Wnt3a, SCF, and ET-3. Seven weeks after inducing differentiation, pigmented cells expressing melanocyte markers such as MITF, tyrosinase, SILV, and TYRP1, were detected. Melanosomes were identified in these pigmented cells by electron microscopy, and global gene expression profiling of the pigmented cells showed a high similarity to that of human primary foreskin-derived melanocytes, suggesting the successful generation of melanocytes from iPS cells. This in vitro differentiation system should prove useful for understanding human melanocyte biology and revealing the mechanism of various pigment cell disorders, including melanoma.
The microRNA (miRNA) miR396 regulates GROWTH-REGULATING FACTORs (GRFs), a plant specific family of transcription factors. Overexpression of miR396 causes a decrease in the GRFs that has been shown to affect cell proliferation in the meristem and developing leaves. To bring further insights into the function of the miR396 regulatory network we performed a mutant enhancer screen of a stable Arabidopsis transgenic line expressing 35S:miR396b, which has a reduction in leaf size. From this screen we recovered several mutants enhancing this phenotype and displaying organs with lotus- or needle-like shape. Analysis of these plants revealed mutations in as2 and rdr6. While 35S:miR396b in an as2 context generated organs with lotus-like shape, the overexpression of the miRNA in an rdr6 mutant background caused more important developmental defects, including pin-like organs and lobed leaves. Combination of miR396 overexpressors, and rdr6 and as2 mutants show additional organ defects, suggesting that the three pathways act in concert. Genetic interactions during leaf development were observed in a similar way between miR396 overexpression and mutants in RDR6, SGS3 or AGO7, which are known to participate in trans-acting siRNA (ta-siRNA) biogenesis. Furthermore, we found that miR396 can cause lotus- and pin-like organs per se, once a certain expression threshold is overcome. In good agreement, mutants accumulating high levels of TCP4, which induces miR396, interacted with the AS1/AS2 pathway to generate lotus-like organs. The results indicate that the miR396 regulatory network and the ta-siRNA biogenesis pathway synergistically interact during leaf development and morphogenesis.
Immune responses to invading pathogens are mediated largely through a family of transmembrane Toll-like receptors and modulated by a number of downstream effectors. In particular, a family of four interleukin 1 receptor-associated kinases (IRAK) regulates responsiveness to bacterial endotoxins. Pharmacological targeting of particular IRAK components may be beneficial for treatment of bacterial infections. Here, we studied transcriptional regulation of the human IRAK2 gene. Analysis of the IRAK2 promoter region reveals putative binding sites for several transcriptional factors, including ZIP (EGR1 and SP1), CTCF and AP-2beta. Deletion of the ZIP or AP-2 sites did not significantly affect IRAK2 promoter activity in naive and endotoxin-treated mononuclear cells, in dormant and activated Jurkat T-cells, in lung and kidney cells. In contrast, we found that CTCF plays a major role in IRAK2 transcription. An electrophoretic mobility shift assay of the DNA fragments containing the IRAK2 CpG island, revealed a single high-affinity binding site for the transcriptional regulator and a chromatin insulator protein, CTCF. This assay revealed a CTCF-binding site within the mouse Irak2 promoter. The presence of the CTCF protein in human IRAK2 promoter was confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Specific residues that interacted with the CTCF protein, were identified by methylation interference assay. In all cell lines analyzed, including cells of lung, renal, monocytic and T-cell origin, the IRAK2 luciferase reporter construct, containing an intact CTCF-binding site, showed strong promoter activity. However, IRAK2 promoter activity was decreased dramatically for the constructs with a mutated CTCF-binding site.
Stem cell-like cells have recently been identified in melanoma cell lines, but their relevance for melanoma pathogenesis is controversial. To characterize the stem cell signature of melanoma, expression of stem cell markers BMI-1 and nestin was studied in 64 cutaneous melanomas, 165 melanoma metastases as well as 53 melanoma cell lines. Stem cell renewal factor BMI-1 is a transcriptional repressor of the Ink4a/Arf locus encoding p16(ink4a) and p14(Arf). Increased nuclear BMI-1 expression was detectable in 41 of 64 (64%) primary melanomas, 117 of 165 melanoma metastases (71%) and 15 of 53 (28%) melanoma cell lines. High nestin expression was observed in 14 of 56 primary melanomas (25%), 84 of 165 melanoma metastases (50%) and 21 of 53 melanoma cell lines (40%). There was a significant correlation between BMI-1 and nestin expression in cell lines (p = 0.001) and metastases (p = 0.02). These data indicate that cells in primary melanomas and their metastases may have stem cell properties. Cell lines obtained from melanoma metastases showed a significant higher BMI-1 expression compared to cell lines from primary melanoma (p = 0.001). Further, primary melanoma lacking lymphatic metastases at presentation (pN0, n = 40) was less frequently BMI-1 positive than melanomas presenting with lymphatic metastases (pN1; n = 24; 52% versus 83%; p = 0.01). Therefore, BMI-1 expression appears to induce a metastatic tendency. Because BMI-1 functions as a transcriptional repressor of the Ink4a/Arf locus, p16(ink4a) and p14(Arf) expression was also analyzed. A high BMI-1/low p16(ink4a) expression pattern was a significant predictor of metastasis by means of logistic regression analysis (p = 0.005). This suggests that BMI-1 mediated repression of p16(ink4a) may contribute to an increased aggressive behavior of stem cell-like melanoma cells.
We investigated the involvement of the recently described staphylococcal enterotoxins G and I in toxic shock syndrome. We reexamined Staphylococcus aureus strains isolated from patients with menstrual and nonmenstrual toxic shock syndrome (nine cases) or staphylococcal scarlet fever (three cases). These strains were selected because they produced none of the toxins known to be involved in these syndromes (toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 and enterotoxins A, B, C, and D), enterotoxin E or H, or exfoliative toxin A or B, despite the fact that superantigenic toxins were detected in a CD69-specific flow cytometry assay measuring T-cell activation. Sets of primers specific to the enterotoxin G and I genes (seg and sei, respectively) were designed and used for PCR amplification. All of the strains were positive for seg and sei. Sequence analysis confirmed that the PCR products, corresponded to the target genes. We suggest that staphylococcal enterotoxins G and I may be capable of causing human staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome and staphylococcal scarlet fever.
Anti-endothelial cell antibodies (AECA) have been frequently detected in systemic vasculitis, which affects blood vessels of various sizes. To understand the pathogenic roles of AECA in systemic vasculitis, we attempted to identify target antigens for AECA comprehensively by a proteomic approach. Proteins extracted from human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis, and Western blotting was subsequently conducted using sera from patients with systemic vasculitis. As a result, 53 autoantigenic protein spots for AECA were detected, nine of which were identified by mass spectrometry. One of the identified proteins was peroxiredoxin 2 (Prx2), an anti-oxidant enzyme. Frequency of anti-Prx2 autoantibodies, measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), was significantly higher in systemic vasculitis (60%) compared to those in collagen diseases without clinical vasculitis (7%, P < 0·01) and healthy individuals (0%, P < 0·01). Further, the titres changed in parallel with the disease activity during time-courses. The presence of anti-Prx2 autoantibodies correlated significantly with elevation of serum d-dimers and thrombin-antithrombin complex (P < 0·05). Immunocytochemical analysis revealed that live endothelial cells expressed Prx2 on their surface. Interestingly, stimulation of HUVEC with rabbit anti-Prx2 antibodies increased secretion of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β, IL-1ra, growth regulated oncogene (GRO)-α, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), IL-8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 more than twofold compared to that of with rabbit immunoglobulin (Ig)G. Taken together, our data suggest that anti-Prx2 autoantibodies would be a useful marker for systemic vasculitis and would be involved in the inflammatory processes of systemic vasculitis.

Phosphoinositide 3-kinase δ is upregulated in lymphocytic leukemias. Because the p85-regulatory subunit binds to any class IA subunit, it was assumed there is a single universal p85-mediated regulatory mechanism; however, we find isozyme-specific inhibition by p85α. Using deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (DXMS), we mapped regulatory interactions of p110δ with p85α. Both nSH2 and cSH2 domains of p85α contribute to full inhibition of p110δ, the nSH2 by contacting the helical domain and the cSH2 via the C terminus of p110δ. The cSH2 inhibits p110β and p110δ, but not p110α, implying that p110α is uniquely poised for oncogenic mutations. Binding RTK phosphopeptides disengages the SH2 domains, resulting in exposure of the catalytic subunit. We find that phosphopeptides greatly increase the affinity of the heterodimer for PIP2-containing membranes measured by FRET. DXMS identified regions decreasing exposure at membranes and also regions gaining exposure, indicating loosening of interactions within the heterodimer at membranes.
BACKGROUND: To evaluate if plasma levels of midregional pro-adrenomedullin (MR-proADM) improve prediction of functional outcome in ischemic stroke.METHODS: In 168 consecutive ischemic stroke patients, plasma levels of MR-proADM were measured within 24 hours from symptom onset. Functional outcome was assessed by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at 90 days following stroke. Logistic regression, receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis, net reclassification improvement (NRI), and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis were applied.RESULTS: Plasma MR-proADM levels were found significantly higher in patients with unfavourable (mRS 3-6) compared to favourable (mRS 0-2) outcomes. MR-proADM levels were entered into a predictive model including the patients' age, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), and the use of recanalization therapy. The area under the ROC curve did not increase significantly. However, category-free NRI of 0.577 (p<0.001) indicated a significant improvement in reclassification of patients. Furthermore, MR-proADM levels significantly improved reclassification of patients in the prediction of outcome by the Stroke Prognostication using Age and NIHSS-100 (SPAN-100; NRI = 0.175; p = 0.04). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed a rising risk of death with increasing MR-proADM quintiles.CONCLUSIONS: Plasma MR-proADM levels improve prediction of functional outcome in ischemic stroke when added to the patients' age, NIHSS on admission, and the use of recanalization therapy. Levels of MR-proADM in peripheral blood improve reclassification of patients when the SPAN-100 is used to predict the patients' functional outcome.
OBJECTIVE: Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha is thought to mediate, in part, the link between obesity and insulin resistance, and women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) have raised serum TNF-alpha concentrations. Our objective was to investigate whether systemic TNF-alpha administration into gravid C57BL6/J mice causes a GDM-like syndrome and affects growth and adipose tissue (AT) development in the offspring.METHODS: We assessed glucose tolerance and reproductive outcome in mice infused with saline, or 2 mug or 4 mug recombinant mouse (rm)TNF-alpha by subcutaneous mini-osmotic pumps between days (d)11.5 and 18.5 of gestation. Subsequently, we studied the effects of the 2-mug dose on maternal AT metabolism. Finally, the growth of offspring exposed to 2 mug rmTNF-alpha in utero was followed until 8 weeks postnatal age. At 8 weeks, we assessed AT accumulation, as well as adipocyte area in white AT and insulin sensitivity in males, and adipokine mRNA levels in various AT depots in females.RESULTS: The peak glucose response to an intraperitoneal glucose stimulus in late-gravid mice and fetal weight were higher with 2 mug but not 4 mug rmTNF-alpha compared with saline; however, 2 mug TNF-alpha did not affect AT parameters. The female but not male offspring of these mice showed accelerated growth, hyperadiposity, robustly increased leptin expression in all AT depots, and raised fasting blood glucose.CONCLUSIONS: TNF-alpha infusion (2 mug for 7 days) in gravid mice resulted in a mild GDM syndrome and accelerated AT development in the offspring in a sex-specific manner. The data suggest that TNF-alpha mediates in part the effects of GDM on fetal growth and postnatal adiposity, and constitutes a potential mediator of intrauterine programming.
The subventricular zone (SVZ) neural stem cell niche contains mixed populations of stem cells, transit-amplifying cells, and migrating neuroblasts. Deciphering how endogenous signals, such as hormones, affect the balance between these cell types is essential for understanding the physiology of niche plasticity and homeostasis. We show that Thyroid Hormone (T(3)) and its receptor, TRα1, are directly involved in maintaining this balance. TRα1 is expressed in amplifying and migrating cells. In vivo gain- and loss-of-function experiments demonstrate first, that T(3)/TRα1 directly repress Sox2 expression, and second, that TRα1 overexpression in the niche favors the appearance of DCX+ migrating neuroblasts. Lack of TRα increases numbers of SOX2+ cells in the SVZ. Hypothyroidism increases proportions of cells in interphase. Thus, in the adult SVZ, T(3)/TRα1 together favor neural stem cell commitment and progression toward a migrating neuroblast phenotype; this transition correlates with T(3)/TRα1-dependent transcriptional repression of Sox2.
BACKGROUND: Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is currently an incurable entity, and new therapeutic approaches are needed. We have applied a high-throughput phospho-proteomic technique to MCL cell lines to identify activated pathways and we have then validated our data in both cell lines and tumor tissues.METHODS: PhosphoScan analysis was performed on MCL cell lines. Results were validated by flow cytometry and western blotting. Functional validation was performed by blocking the most active pathway in MCL cell lines.RESULTS: PhosphoScan identified more than 300 tyrosine-phosporylated proteins, among which many protein kinases. The most abundant peptides belonged to proteins connected with B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling. Active BCR signaling was demonstrated by flow cytometry in MCL cells and by western blotting in MCL tumor tissues. Blocking BCR signaling by Syk inhibitor piceatannol induced dose/time-dependent apoptosis in MCL cell lines, as well as several modifications in the phosphorylation status of BCR pathway members and a collapse of cyclin D1 protein levels.CONCLUSION: Our data support a pro-survival role of BCR signaling in MCL and suggest that this pathway might be a candidate for therapy. Our findings also suggest that Syk activation patterns might be different in MCL compared to other lymphoma subtypes.
Infectious Mononucleosis (IM), a benign lymphoproliferative disease, is the best known clinical syndrome caused by Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV). It usually resolves over a period of weeks or months without sequelae but may occasionally be complicated by a wide variety of neurologic, hematologic, hepatic, respiratory, and psychological complications. In this report we describe a patient with acute hepatitis following EBV-IM in a previously healthy woman. A 26-year-old woman who presented with fever, generalized weakness, nausea, sore throat, yellowing of skin, and a generalized skin rash was admitted to our clinic. Tonsillar enlargement, pharyngeal erythema, palatal petechiae, lymphadenopathy, and jaundice were noted. Significant atypical lymphocytes ( > 10%) were seen on the peripheral blood smear. Liver function tests such as ALT: 303 U/L, AST: 172 U/L, ALP: 193 U/L and total bilirubin: 7.3 mg/dl were elevated. Serological tests for EBV infection were consistent with acute infection (EBV virus capsid antigen was reactive with IgM and IgG antibodies). The Monospot test was also positive. On the seventh day, liver function tests and bilirubin had risen to peak level and platelets were decreased. The patient was managed supportively and her critical condition improved and was finally stabilized. Although the prognosis for IM is very favorable, a variety of acute complications may occur.
The rearrangement of pre-existing genes has long been thought of as the major mode of new gene generation. Recently, de novo gene birth from non-genic DNA was found to be an alternative mechanism to generate novel protein-coding genes. However, its functional role in human disease remains largely unknown. Here we show that NCYM, a cis-antisense gene of the MYCN oncogene, initially thought to be a large non-coding RNA, encodes a de novo evolved protein regulating the pathogenesis of human cancers, particularly neuroblastoma. The NCYM gene is evolutionally conserved only in the taxonomic group containing humans and chimpanzees. In primary human neuroblastomas, NCYM is 100% co-amplified and co-expressed with MYCN, and NCYM mRNA expression is associated with poor clinical outcome. MYCN directly transactivates both NCYM and MYCN mRNA, whereas NCYM stabilizes MYCN protein by inhibiting the activity of GSK3β, a kinase that promotes MYCN degradation. In contrast to MYCN transgenic mice, neuroblastomas in MYCN/NCYM double transgenic mice were frequently accompanied by distant metastases, behavior reminiscent of human neuroblastomas with MYCN amplification. The NCYM protein also interacts with GSK3β, thereby stabilizing the MYCN protein in the tumors of the MYCN/NCYM double transgenic mice. Thus, these results suggest that GSK3β inhibition by NCYM stabilizes the MYCN protein both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, the survival of MYCN transgenic mice bearing neuroblastoma was improved by treatment with NVP-BEZ235, a dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor shown to destabilize MYCN via GSK3β activation. In contrast, tumors caused in MYCN/NCYM double transgenic mice showed chemo-resistance to the drug. Collectively, our results show that NCYM is the first de novo evolved protein known to act as an oncopromoting factor in human cancer, and suggest that de novo evolved proteins may functionally characterize human disease.
BACKGROUND: Expanded endothelial progenitor cells (eEPC) improve global left ventricular function in experimental myocardial infarction (MI). Erythropoietin beta (EPO) applied together with eEPC may improve regional myocardial function even further by anti-apoptotic and cardioprotective effects. Aim of this study was to evaluate intramyocardial application of eEPCs and EPO as compared to eEPCs or EPO alone in experimental MI.METHODS AND RESULTS: In vitro experiments revealed that EPO dosed-dependently decreased eEPC and leukocyte apoptosis. Moreover, in the presence of EPO mRNA expression in eEPC of proangiogenic and proinflammatory mediators measured by TaqMan PCR was enhanced. Experimental MI was induced by ligation and reperfusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery of nude rats (n = 8-9). After myocardial transplantation of eEPC and EPO CD68+ leukocyte count and vessel density were enhanced in the border zone of the infarct area. Moreover, apoptosis of transplanted CD31 + TUNEL + eEPC was decreased as compared to transplantation of eEPCs alone. Regional wall motion of the left ventricle was measured using Magnetic Resonance Imaging. After injection of eEPC in the presence of EPO regional wall motion significantly improved as compared to injection of eEPCs or EPO alone.CONCLUSION: Intramyocardial transplantation of eEPC in the presence of EPO during experimental MI improves regional wall motion. This was associated with an increased local inflammation, vasculogenesis and survival of the transplanted cells. Local application of EPO in addition to cell therapy may prove beneficial in myocardial remodeling.
Phase II studies using ifosfamide both alone and combined with vindesine and cisplatin have shown the effectiveness of this drug in patients with Ewing's sarcoma (ES) who had relapsed during VAC (vincristine, actinomycin, cyclosphosphamide)/VAd (vincristine, Adriamycin) therapy. In November 1984, these results led the SFOP to adopt a protocol consisting of (1) initial chemotherapy with three cycles of IVA (ifosfamide, 3 g/m2 on days 1 and 2; actinomycin D, 750 mg/m2 on days 1-3; vincristine, 1.5 mg/m2 on day 1) alternating every 3 weeks with IVAd (vincristine on day 22; ifosfamide on days 21-23; Adriamycin, 60 mg/m2 on day 22); (2) radical surgery if possible; (3) local radiotherapy (RT); and (4) maintenance chemotherapy with alternating IVA and VAd (vincristine, Adriamycin) for up to 9 months. In May 1987, 87 patients with previously untreated ES entered the study; 61 had localized ES. To date, 54 patients with localized disease and 22 with metastatic disease have finished initial chemotherapy; 40 patients with localized disease have been evaluated. In all, 28 patients (70%) were in complete remission (17 patients) or had a tumor regression of greater than 50% 11 patients) and were considered to be good responders; 12 patients were considered to be poor responders. After local radiotherapy in all but 7 patients and surgical resection in 29, 52 of 54 were considered to be in clinical remission. A total of 13 patients with metastatic disease were good responders at the completion of the initial chemotherapy. These results confirm the efficacy of primary chemotherapy using ifosfamide for the treatment of ES.
Intrinsically disordered proteins and regions are involved in a wide range of cellular functions, and they often facilitate protein-protein interactions. Molecular recognition features (MoRFs) are segments of intrinsically disordered regions that bind to partner proteins, where binding is concomitant with a transition to a structured conformation. MoRFs facilitate translation, transport, signaling, and regulatory processes and are found across all domains of life. A popular computational tool, MoRFpred, accurately predicts MoRFs in protein sequences. MoRFpred is implemented as a user-friendly web server that is freely available at http://biomine.cs.vcu.edu/servers/MoRFpred/ . We describe this predictor, explain how to run the web server, and show how to interpret the results it generates. We also demonstrate the utility of this web server based on two case studies, focusing on the relevance of evolutionary conservation of MoRF regions.
The global epidemic of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) continues largely unabated due to an increasingly sedentary lifestyle and obesogenic environment. A cost-effective patient-centred approach, incorporating glucose-lowering therapy and modification of cardiovascular risk factors, could help prevent the inevitable development and progression of macrovascular and microvascular complications. Glycaemic optimization requires patient structured education, self-management and empowerment, and psychological support along with early and proactive use of glucose lowering therapies, which should be delivered in a system of care as shown by the Chronic Care Model. From diagnosis, intensive glycaemic control and individualised care is aimed at reducing complications. In older people, the goal is maintaining quality of life and minimizing morbidity, especially as overtreatment increases hypoglycaemia risk. Maintaining durable glycaemic control is challenging and complex to achieve without hypoglycaemia, weight gain and other significant adverse effects. Overcoming patient and physician barriers can help ensure adequate treatment initiation and intensification. Cardiovascular safety studies with newer glucose-lowering agents are now mandatory, with a sodium glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor (empagliflozin), and two glucagon like peptide-1 receptor agonists (liraglutide and semaglutide) being the first to demonstrate superior CV outcomes compared with placebo.
Psychologists, quality of life and well-being researchers have grown increasingly interested in understanding the factors that are associated with human happiness. Although twin studies estimate that genetic factors account for 35-50% of the variance in human happiness, knowledge of specific genes is limited. However, recent advances in molecular genetics can now provide a window into neurobiological markers of human happiness. This investigation examines association between happiness and monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) genotype. Data were drawn from a longitudinal study of a population-based cohort, followed for three decades. In women, low expression of MAOA (MAOA-L) was related significantly to greater happiness (0.261 SD increase with one L-allele, 0.522 SD with two L-alleles, P=0.002) after adjusting for the potential effects of age, education, household income, marital status, employment status, mental disorder, physical health, relationship quality, religiosity, abuse history, recent negative life events and self-esteem use in linear regression models. In contrast, no such association was found in men. This new finding may help explain the gender difference on happiness and provide a link between MAOA and human happiness.
OBJECTIVE: To compare the long term survival of a group of athletes taking prolonged vigorous physical exercise to that of the general population.DESIGN: Follow up of a cohort of participants in the Dutch eleven cities ice skating tour (a race and recreational tour) over a distance of 200 kilometers.SETTING: Data on participation from the organising committee and data on mortality from all municipalities in The Netherlands.SUBJECTS: 2259 Male athletes.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Comparison of all cause mortality in male participants in the tour with that in the general population of The Netherlands.RESULTS: The standardised mortality ratio for all participants during 32 years of follow up was 0.76 (95% confidence interval 0.68 to 0.85), and 0.90 (0.48 to 1.44) for participants in the race, and 0.72 (0.60 to 0.86) for participants in the recreational tour who finished within the time limit.CONCLUSIONS: The capacity for prolonged and vigorous physical exercise, particularly if the exercise is recreational, is a strong indicator of longevity.

Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is a common disorder with strong evidence for genetic predisposition. Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for AIS susceptibility have been identified on chromosomes. We performed a genome-wide genetic linkage scan in seven multiplex families using 400 marker loci with a mean spacing of 8.6 cM. We used Genehunter Plus to generate linkage statistics, expressed as homogeneity (HLOD) scores, under dominant and recessive genetic models. We found a significant linkage signal on chromosome 12p, whose support interval extends from near 12 pter, spanning approximately 10 million bases or 31 cM. Fine mapping within the region using 20 additional markers reveals maximum HLOD = 3.7 at 5 cM under a dominant inheritance model, and a split peak maximum HLOD = 3.2 at 8 and 18 cM under a recessive inheritance model. The linkage support interval contains 95 known genes. We found evidence suggestive of linkage on chromosomes 1, 6, 7, 8, and 14. This study is the first to find evidence of an AIS susceptibility locus on chromosome 12. Detection of AIS susceptibility QTLs on multiple chromosomes in this and other studies demonstrate that the condition is genetically heterogeneous.
Polyubiquitination of proteins plays a critical role in the activation of immune cells. K63-linked polyubiquitin-binding proteins TGF-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1)-binding protein (TAB)2 and TAB3 are implicated in NF-κB signaling via TAK1 activation. However, TAB2 alone is dispensable for NF-κB activation in embryonic fibroblasts, and the functional roles of TAB2 and TAB3 in immune cells has yet to be clarified. In this study, we demonstrate that TAB2 and TAB3 are essential for B cell activation leading to Ag-specific Ab responses, as well as B-1 and marginal zone B cell development. TAB2 and TAB3 are critical for the activation of MAPKs, especially ERK, but not NF-κB, in response to TLR and CD40 stimulation in B cells. Surprisingly, TAB2 and TAB3 are dispensable for TAK1 activation in B cells, indicating that TAB2 and TAB3 activate MAPKs via a pathway independent of TAK1. In contrast to B cells, macrophages lacking TAB2 and TAB3 did not show any defects in the cytokine production and the signaling pathway in response to TLR stimulation. Furthermore, TAB2 and TAB3 were dispensable for TNF-induced cytokine production in embryonic fibroblasts. Thus, TAB2- and TAB3-mediated K63-linked polyubiquitin recognition controls B cell activation via MAPKs, but not the TAK1/NF-κB axis.
A dysfunctional glutamatergic system is thought to be central to the negative symptoms and cognitive deficits recognized as determinant to the poor quality of life of people with schizophrenia. Modulating glutamate uptake has, thus, been suggested as a novel target for antipsychotics. Alstonine is an indole alkaloid sharing with atypical antipsychotics the profile in animal models relevant to schizophrenia, though divergent in its mechanism of action. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of alstonine on glutamate uptake. Additionally, the effects on glutathione content and extracellular S100B levels were assessed. Acute hippocampal slices were incubated with haloperidol (10μM), clozapine (10 and 100μM) or alstonine (1-100μM), alone or in combination with apomorphine (100μM), and 5-HT(2) receptor antagonists (0.01μM altanserin and 0.1μM SB 242084). A reduction in glutamate uptake was observed with alstonine and clozapine, but not haloperidol. Apomorphine abolished the effect of clozapine, whereas 5-HT(2A) and 5-HT(2C) antagonists abolished the effects of alstonine. Increased levels of glutathione were observed only with alstonine, also the only compound that failed to decrease the release of S100B. This study shows that alstonine decreases glutamate uptake, which may be beneficial to the glutamatergic deficit observed in schizophrenia. Noteworthily, the decrease in glutamate uptake is compatible with the reversal of MK-801-induced social interaction and working memory deficits. An additional potential benefit of alstonine as an antipsychotic is its ability to increase glutathione, a key cellular antioxidant reported to be decreased in the brain of patients with schizophrenia. Adding to the characterization of the novel mechanism of action of alstonine, the lack of effect of apomorphine in alstonine-induced changes in glutamate uptake reinforces that D(2) receptors are not primarily implicated. Though clearly mediated by 5-HT(2A) and 5-HT(2C) serotonin receptors, the precise mechanisms that result in the effects of alstonine on glutamate uptake warrant elucidation.
BACKGROUND: Gamabufotalin (CS-6), a major bufadienolide of Chansu, has been used for cancer therapy due to its desirable metabolic stability and less adverse effect. However, the underlying mechanism of CS-6 involved in anti-tumor activity remains poorly understood.METHODS: The biological functions of gamabufotalin (CS-6) were investigated by migration, colony formation and apoptosis assays in NSCLC cells. The nuclear localization and interaction between transcriptional co-activator p300 and NF-κB p50/p65 and their binding to COX-2 promoter were analyzed after treatment with CS-6. Molecular docking study was used to simulate the interaction of CS-6 with IKKβ. The in vivo anti-tumor efficacy of CS-6 was also analyzed in xenografts nude mice. Western blot was used to detect the protein expression level.RESULTS: Gamabufotalin (CS-6) strongly suppressed COX-2 expression by inhibiting the phosphorylation of IKKβ via targeting the ATP-binding site, thereby abrogating NF-κB binding and p300 recruitment to COX-2 promoter. In addition, CS-6 induced apoptosis by activating the cytochrome c and caspase-dependent apoptotic pathway. Moreover, CS-6 markedly down-regulated the protein levels of COX-2 and phosphorylated p65 NF-κB in tumor tissues of the xenograft mice, and inhibited tumor weight and size.CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides pharmacological evidence that CS-6 exhibits potential use in the treatment of COX-2-mediated diseases such as lung cancer.
Annexins are a family of soluble proteins that bind to acidic phospholipids such as phosphatidylserine in a calcium-dependent manner. The archetypical member of the annexin family is annexin A5. For many years, its function remained unknown despite the availability of a high-resolution structure. This, combined with the observations of specific ion conductance in annexin-bound membranes, fueled speculations about the possible membrane-spanning forms of annexins that functioned as ion channels. The channel hypothesis remained controversial and did not gather sufficient evidence to become accepted. Yet, it continues to draw attention as a framework for interpreting indirect (e.g., biochemical) data. The goal of the mini-review is to examine the data on annexin-lipid interactions from the last ~30 years from the point of view of the controversy between the two lines of inquiry: the well-characterized peripheral assembly of the annexins at membranes vs. their putative transmembrane insertion. In particular, the potential role of lipid rearrangements induced by annexin binding is highlighted.
Malignant melanomas may arise in the uveal tract, the conjunctiva, the skin of the eyelid, or the orbit. Risk factors so far identified include pre-existing choroidal naevi for uveal melanomas, primary acquired melanosis (PAM) for conjunctival tumours, and ocular and oculodermal melanocytosis for uveal and orbital lesions. The atypical mole syndrome (AMS) is associated with uveal and conjunctival melanomas, especially when the ocular lesions are multiple or familial. AMS patients should be screened for ocular melanomas. Conjunctival melanomas are managed by excision with or without adjunctive beta-irradiation. Circumscribed tumours have a better prognosis than diffuse and multifocal lesions arising in acquired melanosis and attempts should be made to limit the progress of the latter variant of the disease by treating PAM with cryotherapy. The most significant prognostic factor in uveal melanoma is the size of the tumour at presentation. Early dissemination is the rule and every effort should be made to distinguish a melanoma from a naevus as soon as possible. Small and medium-sized melanomas respond well to focal treatments chosen according to the size and location of the tumour. The techniques employed include photocoagulation, radioactive plaque therapy, proton beam radiotherapy and surgical resection.
Eph receptor tyrosine kinases are involved in nervous system development. Eph ligands, termed ephrins, are transmembrane proteins that bind to Eph receptors, the mutual activation of which causes repulsive effects in reciprocally contacting cells. Previously, we showed that overexpression of EphB2 in glioma cells increases cell invasion. Here, expression profiles of ephrin-B family members were determined in four glioma cell lines and in invading glioblastoma cells collected by laser capture microdissection. Ephrin-B3 mRNA was up-regulated in migrating cells of four of four glioma cell lines (1.3- to 1.7-fold) and in invading tumor cells of eight of eight biopsy specimens (1.2- to 10.0-fold). Forced expression of ephrin-B3 in low expressor cell lines (U87, T98G) stimulated cell migration and invasion in vitro and ex vivo, concomitant with tyrosine phosphorylation of ephrin-B3. In high expressor cell lines (U251, SNB19), ephrin-B3 colocalized with Rac1 to lamellipodia of motile wild-type cells. Cells transfected with ephrin-B3 small interfering RNA (siRNA) showed significant morphologic change and decreased invasion in vitro and ex vivo. Depletion of endogenous ephrin-B3 expression abrogated the increase of migration and invasion induced by EphB2/Fc, indicating increased invasion is dependent on ephrin-B3 activation. Furthermore, using a Rac1-GTP pull-down assay, we showed that ephrin-B3 is associated with Rac1 activation. Reduction of Rac1 by siRNA negated the increased invasion by addition of EphB2/Fc. In human glioma specimens, ephrin-B3 expression and phosphorylation correlated with increasing tumor grade. Immunohistochemistry revealed robust staining for phosphorylated ephrin-B and ephrin-B3 in invading glioblastoma cells. These data show that ephrin-B3 expression and signaling through Rac1 are critically important to glioma invasion.
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic, multisystem, autoimmune disease that can affect any part of the human body including the eyes. Common blinding ocular manifestations include central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO), central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO), severe vaso-occlusive retinopathy, and optic nerve involvement. Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) in lupus is usually associated with large vessel occlusions and needs prompt treatment with anticoagulant. We are reporting two cases of APS in SLE patients that presented with CRVO (case 1) and vaso-occlusive lupus retinopathy (case 2). Both cases were positive for antiphospholipid antibody (APA) and were treated with immunosuppression, anticoagulant, and laser treatment. Thus, screening for APA is vital in SLE patients with lupus retinopathy, as prompt treatment with anticoagulants is important to prevent further vascular thrombosis, which worsens the visual prognosis.
Andersen-Tawil syndrome (ATS) is a multisystem inherited disease exhibiting periodic paralysis, cardiac arrhythmias, and dysmorphic features. In this study, we characterized the KCNJ2 channels with an ATS mutation (T75M) which is associated with cardiac phenotypes of bi-directional ventricular tachycardia, syncope, and QT(c) prolongation. Confocal imaging of GFP-KCNJ2 fusion proteins showed that the T75M mutation impaired membrane localization of the channel protein, which was restored by co-expression of WT channels with T75M channels. Whole-cell patch-clamp experiments in CHO-K1 cells showed that the T75M mutation produced a loss-of-function of the channel. When both WT and the T75M were co-expressed, the T75M mutation showed dominant-negative effects on inward rectifier K+ current densities, with prominent suppression of outward currents at potentials between 0 mV and +80 mV over the E(K). Inside-out patch experiments in HEK293T cells revealed that co-expression of WT and the T75M channels enhanced voltage-dependent block of the channels by internal Mg2+, resulting in enhanced inward rectification at potentials 50 mV more positive than the E(K). We suggest that the T75M mutation causes dominant-negative suppression of the co-expressed WT KCNJ2 channels. In addition, the T75M mutation caused alteration of gating kinetics of the mutated KCNJ2 channels, i.e., increased sensitivity to intracellular Mg2+ and resultant enhancement of inward rectification. The data presented suggest that the mutation may influence clinical features, but it does not directly show this.
INTRODUCTION: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterized by systemic synovitis causing joint destruction. With the development of biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) and combination of conventional DMARDs, clinical remission is perceived as an appropriate and realistic goal in many patients. However, bDMARDs require intravenous or subcutaneous injection and some patients fail to respond to bDMARDs or lose their primary response. Under the circumstances, targeted synthetic DMARDs (tsDMARDs), which are orally available low-molecular weight products, have been emerging. Five phase 3 trials of Baricitinib, a JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitor, have been performed and showed high clinical efficacy in patients with active RA and naïve to sDMARDs or an inadequate response to sDMARDs, MTX or bDMARDs. There was a favorable response for clinical and functional parameters in studies with placebo, MTX and adalimumab as comparator. It is also reported that safety was tolerable within the limited study period.AREAS COVERED: We here review the recent progress in the development of baricitinib and its potential for the treatment of RA. Expert commentary: Although baricitinib is only one of the highly effective DMARDs that has a new mode of action, it will bring new concepts for rheumatology in the future.
Fully virulent Bacillus anthracis bacilli are encapsulated and toxinogenic. These bacteria carry two plasmids, pXO1, and pXO2, encoding toxins and capsule synthetic-enzymes (capB, C, A, dep), respectively. The PXO1 plasmid strongly enhances capsule formation. This influence was studied by analysing the expression of a capB-lacZ fusion in various backgrounds. The beta-galactosidase activities were similar in a delta atxA strain and a pXO1 cured strain. Moreover, the capB-lacZ expression level could be restored, in a pXO1 cured strain, by addition of atxA in trans. Thus, we conclude that the pX01 influence on capsule synthesis is mediated by AtxA, the pXO1-encoded trans-activator of the toxin gene expression.
INTRODUCTION: Early stage estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer may be treated with chemotherapy in addition to hormone therapy. Currently available molecular signatures assess the risk of recurrence and the benefit of chemotherapy; however, these tests may have large intermediate risk groups, limiting their usefulness.METHODS: The EarlyR prognostic score was developed using integrative analysis of microarray data sets and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded-based quantitative real-time PCR assay and validated in Affymetrix data sets and METABRIC cohort using Cox proportional hazards models and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Concordance index was used to measure the probability of prognostic score agreement with outcome.RESULTS: The EarlyR score and categorical risk strata (EarlyR-Low, EarlyR-Int, EarlyR-High) derived from expression of ESPL1, MKI67, SPAG5, PLK1 and PGR was prognostic of 8-year distant recurrence-free interval in Affymetrix (categorical P = 3.5 × 10-14; continuous P = 8.8 × 10-15) and METABRIC (categorical P < 2.2 × 10-16; continuous P < 10-16) data sets of ER+ breast cancer. Similar results were observed for the breast cancer-free interval end point. At most 13% of patients were intermediate risk and at least 66% patients were low risk in both ER+ cohorts. The EarlyR score was significantly prognostic (distant recurrence-free interval; P < .001) in both lymph node-negative and lymph node-positive patients and was independent from clinical factors. EarlyR and surrogates of current molecular signatures were comparable in prognostic significance by concordance index.CONCLUSION: The 5-gene EarlyR score is a robust prognostic assay that identified significantly fewer patients as intermediate risk and more as low risk than currently available assays. Further validation of the assay in clinical trial-derived cohorts is ongoing.
A concise asymmetric synthesis has been developed to prepare idasanutlin, a small molecule MDM2 antagonist. Idasanutlin is currently being investigated as a potential treatment for various solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. The highly congested pyrrolidine core, containing four contiguous stereocenters, was constructed via a Cu(I)/(R)-BINAP catalyzed [3+2]-cycloaddition reaction. This optimized copper(<small>I</small>)-catalyzed process has been used to produce more than 1500 kg of idasanutlin. The manufacturing process will be described, highlighting the exceptionally selective and consistent cycloaddition/isomerization/hydrolysis sequence. The excellent yields, short cycle times and reduction in waste streams result in a sustainable production process with low environmental impact.
New treatment strategies in rheumatoid arthritis are targeted to interfere with critical mediators of inflammation. Proinflammatory cytokines like IL-1 beta and TNFalpha play a crucial role in induction and maintenance of synovitis, pannus formation and bone and cartilage destruction. Within a few years, these morphological changes may lead to joint destruction and consecutively to functional impairment. Since April 2002 a recombinant human interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (Anakinra) is available in Germany for treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Anakinra (Kineret(R)) is approved for therapy in combination with methotrexate and should be applied according to guidelines established by the German Rheumatology Society for the use of biologicals in treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The approval of anakinra as a new therapeutic is based on data obtained in large multicenter, placebo-controlled, and randomised trials in comparison to placebo. Treatment of Anakinra as monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate lead to significant improvement of signs and symptoms of disease as measured by the ACR 20 (or more) response and was associated with a slower radiographic progression with regard to joint space narrowing and development of erosions. Anakinra showed a favourable safety profile with injection side reactions as the predominant side effect that occurs in 70% of patients usually after 10-12 days of treatment and that are mostly mild to moderate and self-limiting. Patients with previous pneumonia or other risk factors for pulmonary infections such as chronic obstructive lung disease seem to show a slightly increased risk of developing infectious complications of the bronchopulmonary system while being on anakinra and should be monitored appropriately. Combining IL-1ra treatment with the use of anti-TNF agents showed an increased risk of infectious complications in clinical studies and is not recommended at present. Studies are currently assessing the use of anakinra for treatment of other rheumatic diseases like psoriatic arthritis, juvenile arthritis or spondylarthropathy.
The comparative effects of L-3,4-dihydroxphenylalanine (L-DOPA) on dopamine synthesis, release and behaviour were studied in the reserpine-treated rat. Acute administration of L-DOPA (25-200 mg/kg) dose-dependently inhibited the activity of aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) in the substantia nigra and corpus striatum. The antiparkinsonian drugs budipine (10 mg/kg) and amantadine (40 mg/kg) enhanced AADC activity in these regions, and prevented or reversed AADC inhibition by L-DOPA. Dual probe dialysis revealed that low doses of L-DOPA (25-50 mg/kg) dose-dependently stimulated the release of dopamine and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) in nigra and striatum, whilst high doses of L-DOPA (100-200 mg/kg) completely suppressed the release of dopamine, but not DOPAC. Sulpiride (50 microM) administered via the probes antagonized dopamine release in response to 25 mg/kg L-DOPA, but greatly facilitated release by 200 mg/kg L-DOPA. Dopamine release was blocked by the centrally acting AADC inhibitor NSD 1015, but facilitated by the central AADC activator budipine. In behavioural tests L-DOPA (plus benserazide, 50 mg/kg) only reversed akinesia at 200 mg/kg, and not at 25-100 mg/kg. Pretreatment with either NSD 1015 (100 mg/kg) or budipine (10 mg/kg) markedly potentiated the motor stimulant action of a threshold dose of L-DOPA (100 mg/kg). A combination of NSD 1015 (100 mg/kg) and benserazide (50 mg/kg) potentiated L-DOPA behaviour more effectively than either inhibitor alone. NSD 1015-facilitated L-DOPA behaviour was antagonized by sulpiride (100 mg/kg) and not by SCH 23390 (1 mg/kg), whereas budipine-facilitated L-DOPA behaviour was fully antagonized by SCH 23390 and only partially by sulpiride. These results show that behaviourally active doses of L-DOPA in the reserpinized rat are not accompanied by significant increases in extracellular dopamine and are therefore probably not dopamine mediated. We propose that L-DOPA is capable of directly stimulating dopamine D2 and possibly non-dopamine receptors, thereby inhibiting dopamine efflux presynaptically and promoting motor activation postsynaptically. A stimulant action of L-DOPA on motor behaviour, preferentially mediated by D1 > D2 receptors, suggests that L-DOPA may also be capable of yielding a dopamine-like response in the absence of detectable dopamine release. These findings are incorporated into a new model of L-DOPA's actions in the reserpinized rat, and their possible implications for our understanding of L-DOPA in Parkinson's disease are discussed.
DNA methylation is a postreplicative modification occurred in most prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes, which has a variety of important biological functions including regulation of gene expression, gene imprinting, preservation of chromosomal integrity, and X-chromosome inactivation. According to their structure and functions, DNA methyltransferases (Dnmts) are divided into two major families in mammalian cells: maintenance methyltransferase (Dnmt1) and de novo methyltransferases (Dnmt3a, Dnmt3b, and Dnmt3L). In addition, Dnmt2 also displays weak DNA methyltransferase catalytic activity, but newly founded function is to methylate cytosine 38 in the anti-codon loop of tRNAAsp. These Dnmts are crucial for mammalian growth and development. Dnmts deficiency will lead to embryonic development defects, cancer, and other diseases. Therefore, Dnmts could be important therapeutical targets. This article summarizes the classification, function, and recent research progress in DNA methyltransferases.
The human genome contains thousands of long noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) transcribed from diverse genomic locations. A large set of long ncRNAs is transcribed independent of protein-coding genes. We have used the GENCODE annotation of the human genome to identify 3019 long ncRNAs expressed in various human cell lines and tissue. This set of long ncRNAs responds to differentiation signals in primary human keratinocytes and is coexpressed with important regulators of keratinocyte development. Depletion of a number of these long ncRNAs leads to the repression of specific genes in their surrounding locus, supportive of an activating function for ncRNAs. Using reporter assays, we confirmed such activating function and show that such transcriptional enhancement is mediated through the long ncRNA transcripts. Our studies show that long ncRNAs exhibit functions similar to classically defined enhancers, through an RNA-dependent mechanism.
Although rare, invasive meningococcal disease remains an important cause of mortality and morbidity in children and young adults. Vaccines have been successfully introduced to help protect against meningococcal disease caused by serogroups A, C, W and Y, but until recently, a vaccine for serogroup B (MenB) was not available. In many industrialised countries, MenB causes the majority of meningococcal disease. Moreover, MenB outbreaks occur unpredictably, particularly in high-risk populations, such as university students. In 2013, Bexsero(®) became the first broad-coverage vaccine to be licensed for active immunisation against MenB disease. Bexsero is now licensed in more than 35 countries worldwide for varying age groups, including the EU, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Uruguay and the USA. Clinical recommendations for the use of Bexsero have been published in several countries. Recommendations include use in high-risk groups, outbreak control and routine infant immunisation. Since initial licensure, considerable clinical experience has been gained. In Canada, 43,740 individuals received Bexsero during a vaccination programme in the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean region of Quebec, where local disease incidence was high. In the USA, Bexsero was administered to >15,000 individuals during two college outbreaks prior to licensure, under an Investigational New Drug protocol. In the UK, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation has recommended the inclusion of Bexsero in the routine immunisation schedule for infants. Publically funded vaccination programmes have been initiated in Italy, and there has been widespread use of the vaccine outside of publically reimbursed programmes. Overall, >1,000,000 doses of Bexsero have been distributed in 19 countries worldwide since 2013. The emerging clinical experience with Bexsero is consistent with findings from pre-licensure clinical studies, and no new safety concerns have been identified. Additional data on length of protection, potential impact on meningococcal carriage and transmission and strain coverage have also been published and will be reviewed.
BACKGROUND: Rett syndrome (RTT), a neurodevelopmental disorder that primarily affects girls, is characterised by a period of apparently normal development until 6-18 months of age when motor and communication abilities regress. More than 95% of individuals with RTT have mutations in methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2), whose protein product modulates gene transcription. Surprisingly, although the disorder is caused by mutations in a single gene, disease severity in affected individuals can be quite variable. To explore the source of this phenotypic variability, we propose that specific MECP2 mutations lead to different degrees of disease severity.METHODS: Using a database of 1052 participants assessed over 4940 unique visits, the largest cohort of both typical and atypical RTT patients studied to date, we examined the relationship between MECP2 mutation status and various phenotypic measures over time.RESULTS: In general agreement with previous studies, we found that particular mutations, such as p.Arg133Cys, p.Arg294X, p.Arg306Cys, 3° truncations and other point mutations, were relatively less severe in both typical and atypical RTT. In contrast, p.Arg106Trp, p.Arg168X, p.Arg255X, p.Arg270X, splice sites, deletions, insertions and deletions were significantly more severe. We also demonstrated that, for most mutation types, clinical severity increases with age. Furthermore, of the clinical features of RTT, ambulation, hand use and age at onset of stereotypies are strongly linked to overall disease severity.CONCLUSIONS: We have confirmed that MECP2 mutation type is a strong predictor of disease severity. These data also indicate that clinical severity continues to become progressively worse regardless of initial severity. These findings will allow clinicians and families to anticipate and prepare better for the needs of individuals with RTT.
MOTIVATION: As cancer genomics initiatives move toward comprehensive identification of genetic alterations in cancer, attention is now turning to understanding how interactions among these genes lead to the acquisition of tumor hallmarks. Emerging pharmacological and clinical data suggest a highly promising role of cancer-specific protein-protein interactions (PPIs) as druggable cancer targets. However, large-scale experimental identification of cancer-related PPIs remains challenging, and currently available resources to explore oncogenic PPI networks are limited.RESULTS: Recently, we have developed a PPI high-throughput screening platform to detect PPIs between cancer-associated proteins in the context of cancer cells. Here, we present the OncoPPi Portal, an interactive web resource that allows investigators to access, manipulate and interpret a high-quality cancer-focused network of PPIs experimentally detected in cancer cell lines. To facilitate prioritization of PPIs for further biological studies, this resource combines network connectivity analysis, mutual exclusivity analysis of genomic alterations, cellular co-localization of interacting proteins and domain-domain interactions. Estimates of PPI essentiality allow users to evaluate the functional impact of PPI disruption on cancer cell proliferation. Furthermore, connecting the OncoPPi network with the approved drugs and compounds in clinical trials enables discovery of new tumor dependencies to inform strategies to interrogate undruggable targets like tumor suppressors. The OncoPPi Portal serves as a resource for the cancer research community to facilitate discovery of cancer targets and therapeutic development.AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The OncoPPi Portal is available at http://oncoppi.emory.edu.CONTACT: andrey.ivanov@emory.edu or hfu@emory.edu.
Pyrimidine biosynthesis presents an attractive drug target in malaria parasites due to the absence of a pyrimidine salvage pathway. A set of compounds designed to inhibit the Plasmodium falciparum pyrimidine biosynthetic enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (PfDHODH) was synthesized. PfDHODH-specific inhibitors with low nanomolar binding affinities were identified that bind in the N-terminal hydrophobic channel of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, the presumed site of ubiquinone binding during oxidation of dihydroorotate to orotate. These compounds also prevented growth of cultured parasites at low micromolar concentrations. Models that suggest the mode of inhibitor binding is based on shape complementarity, matching hydrophobic regions of inhibitor and enzyme, and interaction of inhibitors with amino acid residues F188, H185, and R265 are supported by mutagenesis data. These results further highlight PfDHODH as a promising new target for chemotherapeutic intervention in prevention of malaria and provide better understanding of the factors that determine specificity over human dihydroorotate dehydrogenase.
Congenital leukemia is a rare but a well-documented disease in which leukemic process is detected at birth or very shortly thereafter (Philip McCoy and Roy Overton, Commun Clin Cytom 22:85-88, 1995). These leukemias represent approximately 0.8 % of all childhood leukemias. We present a case of congenital acute myeloid leukemia manifesting from the very first day of birth. Diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia was suspected by the presence of blasts in the peripheral blood smear and was confirmed on bone marrow by flowcytometry. Karyotyping revealed Trisomy 21.
IMPORTANCE: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is characterized by vaso-occlusive crisis. In the eye, central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) is a rare complication in SCD, with only 1 previous report of bilateral, concurrent CRAO. We report a case of bilateral, concurrent CRAO in a patient with SCD, possibly precipitated by the use of phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors.OBSERVATIONS: A 37-year-old African American woman with a known medical history significant for SCD and pulmonary arterial hypertension who was receiving treatment with tadalafil, a phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor, developed bilateral, concurrent CRAO that persisted after exchange transfusion.CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Bilateral CRAO secondary to SCD is extremely rare, with only 1 previous case report in the literature. The use of phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors is an additional risk factor and may have contributed to the development of concurrent CRAO in this patient.
We used positron emission tomography to measure hippocampal and medial temporal lobe metabolism in brains of patients intoxicated by domoic acid from Prince Edward Island mussels. This analog of kainic acid specifically excites certain neurons in the hippocampus, and the study revealed a severe reduction of glucose metabolism in this part of the brain which paralleled the absence of long-, medium-, or short-term memory in these patients.
The mammalian INO80 remodelling complex facilitates homologous recombination (HR), but the mechanism by which it does this is unclear. Budding yeast INO80 can remove H2A.Z/H2B dimers from chromatin and replace them with H2A/H2B dimers. H2A.Z is actively incorporated at sites of damage in mammalian cells, raising the possibility that H2A.Z may need to be subsequently removed for resolution of repair. Here, we show that H2A.Z in human cells is indeed rapidly removed from chromatin flanking DNA damage by INO80. We also report that the histone chaperone ANP32E, which is implicated in removing H2AZ from chromatin, similarly promotes HR and appears to work on the same pathway as INO80 in these assays. Importantly, we demonstrate that the HR defect in cells depleted of INO80 or ANP32E can be rescued by H2A.Z co-depletion, suggesting that H2A.Z removal from chromatin is the primary function of INO80 and ANP32E in promoting homologous recombination.
Nutcracker esophagus and jackhammer esophagus are largely unknown motility disorders, also sometimes called hypertensive and hypercontractile peristalsis, respectively. There is currently no standardized diagnostic or management plan for these diseases. Here, we report on three patients with jackhammer/nutcracker esophagus who were treated with either peroral endoscopic myotomy or a systemic steroid regimen, focusing particularly on two novel presentations of nutcracker and jackhammer esophagus involving eosinophilic infiltration into the muscularis propria, and their responses to both interventions.
BACKGROUND: Benralizumab is an anti-eosinophilic, anti-interleukin-5 receptor α monoclonal antibody that has been shown to significantly reduce asthma exacerbations and improve lung function for patients with severe, uncontrolled asthma. We further explored the efficacy of benralizumab for patients with different baseline blood eosinophil thresholds and exacerbation histories.METHODS: This study is a pooled analysis of the results from the randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled SIROCCO (NCT01928771) and CALIMA (NCT01914757) phase 3 studies. In these studies, patients with severe, uncontrolled asthma were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive subcutaneous benralizumab 30 mg, either every 4 weeks or every 8 weeks (with first three doses given every 4 weeks), or placebo every 4 weeks. The primary endpoint was annual exacerbation rate (AER) ratio versus placebo, analysed by baseline eosinophil counts (≥0, ≥150, ≥300, or ≥450 cells per μL) and by number of exacerbations (two vs three or more) during the year before enrolment. The analyses were done in accordance with the intention-to-treat principle.FINDINGS: Of 2295 patients, 756 received benralizumab every 4 weeks, 762 received benralizumab every 8 weeks, and 777 patients received placebo. AER among patients with baseline blood eosinophil counts of at least 0 cells per μL was 1·16 (95% CI 1·05-1·28) in patients who received placebo versus 0·75 (0·66-0·84) in patients who received benralizumab every 8 weeks (rate ratio 0·64, 0·55-0·75; p<0·0001). In patients who received benralizumab every 4 weeks who had eosinophil counts of 0 or more cells per μL, AER was 0·73 (0·65-0·82); rate ratio versus placebo was 0·63 (0·54-0·74; p<0·0001). The extent to which exacerbation rates were reduced increased with increasing blood eosinophil thresholds and with greater exacerbation history in patients in the 4-weekly and 8-weekly benralizumab groups. Greater improvements in AER were seen with benralizumab compared with placebo for patients with a combination of high blood eosinophil thresholds and a history of more frequent exacerbations.INTERPRETATION: These results will help to guide clinicians when they are deciding whether to use benralizumab to treat patients with severe, uncontrolled, eosinophilic asthma.FUNDING: AstraZeneca.
Calciphylaxis is a rare condition characterized by medial calcification of small- and medium-sized vessels that subsequently leads to ischemic necrosis. Calciphylaxis most often occurs in patients with end-stage renal disease and secondary hyperparathyroidism. We present a unique case of calciphylaxis in which the patient did not have end-stage renal disease. Instead, primary hyperparathyroidism and/or alcoholic cirrhosis were the more likely causes of her calciphylaxis. In addition, our case demonstrated not only calciphylaxis but also fragmentation and calcification of elastic fibers within the dermis, changes that are most often seen in pseudoxanthoma elasticum. This is the first reported case of calciphylaxis, to our knowledge, with histopathologic changes of pseudoxanthoma elasticum in a patient who is nonuremic.
We determined muscle fiber type-specific hypertrophy and changes in satellite cell (SC) content following a 12-week resistance training program in 13 healthy, elderly men (72 +/- 2 years). Leg strength and body composition (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and computed tomography) were assessed, and muscle biopsy samples were collected. Leg strength increased 25%-30% after training (p < .001). Leg lean mass and quadriceps cross-sectional area increased 6%-9% (p < .001). At baseline, mean fiber area and SC content were smaller in the Type II versus Type I muscle fibers (p < .01). Following training, Type II muscle fiber area increased from 5,438 +/- 319 to 6,982 +/- 503 microm(2) (p < .01). Type II muscle fiber SC content increased from 0.048 +/- 0.003 to 0.084 +/- 0.008 SCs per fiber (p < .001). No changes were observed in the Type I muscle fibers. In older adults, skeletal muscle tissue is still capable of inducing SC proliferation and differentiation, resulting in Type II muscle fiber hypertrophy.
Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a syndrome in which the airflow created from breathing ceases through the upper airway although diaphragm movement continues. Resulting complications include severe daytime sleepiness, morning headaches, loud snoring, and disturbed nighttime sleep. Patients affected with OSA are frequently hypertensive and can have dangerous cardiac arrhythmias. The diagnosis of OSA requires an all-night polysomnographic recording; neither snoring nor other subjective complaints constitute adequate criteria for treatment. The treatment objective for OSA is to maintain airway patency. A potential treatment discussed here is temporary advancement of the mandible or tongue during sleep with the use of dental appliances.
Radiotherapy is used in locally advanced pancreatic cancers in which it can improve survival in combination with gemcitabine. However, prognosis is still poor in this setting in which more effective therapies remain needed. MLN4924 is an investigational small molecule currently in phase I clinical trials. MLN4924 inhibits NAE (NEDD8 Activating Enzyme), a pivotal regulator of the E3 ubiquitin ligase SCF (SKP1, Cullins, and F-box protein), that has been implicated recently in DNA damage and repair. In this study, we provide evidence that MLN4924 can be used as an effective radiosensitizer in pancreatic cancer. Specifically, MLN4924 (20-100 nmol/L) effectively inhibited cullin neddylation and sensitized pancreatic cancer cells to ionizing radiation in vitro with a sensitivity enhancement ratio of approximately 1.5. Mechanistically, MLN4924 treatment stimulated an accumulation of several SCF substrates, including CDT1, WEE1, and NOXA, in parallel with an enhancement of radiation-induced DNA damage, aneuploidy, G(2)/M phase cell-cycle arrest, and apoptosis. RNAi-mediated knockdown of CDT1 and WEE1 partially abrogated MLN4924-induced aneuploidy, G(2)/M arrest, and radiosensitization, indicating a causal effect. Furthermore, MLN4924 was an effective radiosensitizer in a mouse xenograft model of human pancreatic cancer. Our findings offer proof-of-concept for use of MLN4924 as a novel class of radiosensitizer for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.
Skin lesions are a severe disease globally. Early detection of melanoma in dermoscopy images significantly increases the survival rate. However, the accurate recognition of melanoma is extremely challenging due to the following reasons: low contrast between lesions and skin, visual similarity between melanoma and non-melanoma lesions, etc. Hence, reliable automatic detection of skin tumors is very useful to increase the accuracy and efficiency of pathologists. In this paper, we proposed two deep learning methods to address three main tasks emerging in the area of skin lesion image processing, i.e., lesion segmentation (task 1), lesion dermoscopic feature extraction (task 2) and lesion classification (task 3). A deep learning framework consisting of two fully convolutional residual networks (FCRN) is proposed to simultaneously produce the segmentation result and the coarse classification result. A lesion index calculation unit (LICU) is developed to refine the coarse classification results by calculating the distance heat-map. A straight-forward CNN is proposed for the dermoscopic feature extraction task. The proposed deep learning frameworks were evaluated on the ISIC 2017 dataset. Experimental results show the promising accuracies of our frameworks, i.e., 0.753 for task 1, 0.848 for task 2 and 0.912 for task 3 were achieved.
We examined whether changes in gut hormone levels due to a single bout of aerobic exercise differ between obese young males and normal controls, and attempted to determine the involvement of hormonal changes during exercise in the regulation of energy balance (EB) in these obese subjects. Seven obese and seven age-matched subjects of normal weight participated in exercise and rest sessions. Subjects consumed a standardized breakfast that was followed by constant cycling exercise at 50% VO(2max) or rest for 60 min. At lunch, a test meal was presented, and energy intake (EI) and relative energy intake (REI) were calculated. Blood samples were obtained at 30 min intervals during both sessions for measurement of glucose, insulin, glucagon, ghrelin, peptide YY (PYY), and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). Plasma levels of PYY and GLP-1 were increased by exercise, whereas plasma ghrelin levels were unaffected by exercise. The areas under the curve (AUC) of the time courses of PYY and GLP-1 levels did not significantly differ between the two groups. In contrast, EI and REI were decreased by exercise in both groups, and energy deficit was significantly larger in obese subjects than in normal controls. The present findings suggest that short-term EB during a single exercise session might be regulated not by increased amounts of these gut hormones per se.
Women presenting with low pressure post-partum headache following neuraxial techniques are frequently offered an epidural blood patch, despite its inherent risks. We present two parturients with classical symptoms of low-pressure headache, who each received neuraxial labour analgesia without a documented dural puncture with a Tuohy needle. Both parturients were successfully managed using acupuncture rather than an epidural blood patch.
DNA replication is one of the most important events in living cells, and it is still a key problem how the DNA replication machinery works in its details. A replication fork has to be a very dynamic apparatus since frequent DNA polymerase switches from the initiating DNA polymerase alpha to the processive elongating DNA polymerase delta occur at the leading strand (about 8 x 10(4) fold on both strands in one replication round) as well as at the lagging strand (about 2 x 10(7) fold on both strands in one replication round) in mammalian cells. Lagging strand replication involves a very complex set of interacting proteins that are able to frequently initiate, elongate and process Okazaki fragments of 180 bp. Moreover, key proteins of this important process appear to be controlled by S-phase check-point proteins. It became furthermore clear in the last few years that DNA replication cannot be considered uncoupled from DNA repair, another very important event for any living organism. The reconstitution of nucleotide excision repair and base excision repair in vitro with purified components clearly showed that the DNA synthesis machinery of both of these macromolecular events are similar and do share many components of the lagging strand DNA synthesis machinery. In this minireview we summarize our current knowledge of the components involved in the execution and regulation of DNA replication at the lagging strand of the replication fork.
Western blots are used to specifically measure the relative quantities of proteins of interest in complex biological samples. Quantitative measurements can be subject to error due to process inconsistencies such as uneven protein transfer to the membrane. These non-sample-related variations need to be compensated for by an approach known as normalization. Two approaches to data normalization are commonly employed: housekeeping protein (HKP) normalization and total protein normalization (TPN). In this study, we evaluated the performance of Stain-Free technology as a novel TPN tool for Western blotting experiments in comparison with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) as a representative of the HKP normalization strategy. The target protein (TP) used for this study was MCM7, a DNA licensing replication factor, which was shown previously to be down-regulated by 20% in irradiated lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). We studied the regulation of MCM7 with a multiplex Western blotting approach based on fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies and found that Stain-Free technology appears to be more reliable, more robust, and more sensitive to small effects of protein regulation when compared with HKP normalization with GAPDH. Stain-Free technology offers the additional advantages of providing checkpoints throughout the Western blotting process by allowing rapid visualization of gel separation and protein transfer.
The human beta-globin dominant control region (DCR) which flanks the multigene beta-globin locus directs high level, site of integration independent, copy number dependent expression on a linked human beta-globin gene in transgenic mice and stably transfected mouse erythroleukemia (MEL) cells. We have assayed each of the individual DNaseI hypersensitive regions present in the full 15kb DCR for position independence and copy number dependence of a linked beta-globin gene in transgenic mice. The results show that at least three of the individual DNaseI hypersensitive site regions (sites 1, 2 and 3), though expressing at lower levels than the full DCR, are capable of position independent, copy number dependent expression. Site 2 alone directs the highest level of expression of the single site constructs, producing nearly 70% of the level of the full DCR. Sites 1 and 3 each provide 30% of the full activity. Deletion of either site 2 or 3 from the complete set significantly reduces the level of expression, but does not effect position independence or copy number dependence. This demonstrates that sites 2 and 3 are required for full expression and suggests that all the sites are required for the full expression of even a single gene from this multigene locus.
Rasburicase is a new treatment for hyperuricemia, a metabolic manifestation of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). Rasburicase has a unique mechanism of action that allows uric acid byproducts to be easily excreted in the urine. Clinical trials have shown that rasburicase has a rapid onset of action that allows chemotherapy to be delivered on time and prevents hyperuricemia-related complications, including renal compromise. The drug has been used successfully in adults and children. The main side effect of rasburicase is the potential for a hypersensitivity reaction. The drug is contraindicated in patients with glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency because this can precipitate hemolytic anemia. The drug has not been studied in patients with a history of allergies or asthma. Oncology nurses play a major role in the assessment and management of TLS-related complications. They must assess patients for G6PD deficiency and signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity reaction before and during chemotherapy or other therapeutic interventions. Nurses play a direct role in preventing complications related to TLS and contributing to the quality of life in this patient population.
BACKGROUND: Inactivation of retinoblastoma (RB) tumor suppressor function occurs frequently in lung cancer. Short-hairpin RNA can be constructed to target specific sequences and efficiently knock down protein expression. We developed a short-hairpin RNA approach to specifically target Rb in lung cancer cells to determine the influence of RB knockdown on proliferation.METHODS: NCI-H520 human lung cancer cells (wild-type Rb) were transfected with pMSCVpuro-Rb3C, a plasmid containing a short-hairpin sequence targeted to human Rb. Transfectants harboring the construct were selected with puromycin. Loss of RB expression in selected cell populations was determined by immunoblotting. Proliferating cells were counted to establish growth rates. Retinoblastoma-proficient and RB-deficient tumor growth was monitored in nude mice.RESULTS: Transfection with pMSCVpuro-Rb3C dramatically diminished RB expression and led to aberrant expression of RB-regulated genes. Cells harboring pMSCVpuro-Rb3C grew at an increased rate compared with control cells: 480.6 +/- 37.7 versus 159.4 +/- 36.2 (relative cell count at 12 days). Tumor growth in nude mice also increased with RB knockdown compared with control mice: 135.2 +/- 73.6 mm3 versus 40.0 +/- 17.0 mm3 (tumor volume at 10 days).CONCLUSIONS: Inhibition of RB expression is efficiently achieved in lung cancer cells with short-hairpin RNA. Genetic targets of RB are deregulated with RB knockdown. Retinoblastoma depletion increases growth in vitro and in murine xenografts. These studies indicate that even in the context of an established tumor cell line, RB limits tumorigenic proliferation. Additionally, this model will serve as an ideal system to evaluate the role of RB activity on therapeutic response.
INTRODUCTION: This study investigated five confirmed rheumatoid arthritis (RA) susceptibility genes/loci (HLA-DRB1, PTPN22, STAT4, OLIG3/TNFAIP3 and TRAF1/C5) for association with susceptibility and severity in an inception cohort.METHODS: The magnitude of association for each genotype was assessed in 1,046 RA subjects from the Yorkshire Early RA cohort and in 5,968 healthy UK controls. Additional exploratory subanalyses were undertaken in subgroups defined by autoantibody status (rheumatoid factor and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide) or disease severity (baseline articular erosions, Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) score and swollen joint count (SJC)).RESULTS: In the total RA inception cohort, the HLA-DRB1 shared epitope (per-allele odds ratio (OR) = 2.1, trend P < 0.0001), PTPN22 (per-allele OR = 1.5, trend P < 0.0001), OLIG3/TNFAIP3 locus (per-allele OR = 1.2, trend P = 0.009) and TRAF1/C5 locus (per-allele OR = 1.1, trend P = 0.04) were associated with RA. The magnitude of association for these loci was increased in those patients who were autoantibody-positive. PTPN22 was associated with autoantibody-negative RA (per-allele OR = 1.3, trend P = 0.04). There was no evidence of association between these five genetic loci and baseline erosions or SJC in the total RA cohort, after adjustment for symptom duration. TRAF1/C5 was significantly associated with baseline HAQ, however, following adjustment for symptom duration (P trend = 0.03).CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the mounting evidence that different genetic loci are associated with autoantibody-positive and autoantibody-negative RA, possibly suggesting that many of the genes identified to date are associated with autoantibody production. Additional studies with a specific focus on autoantibody-negative RA will be needed to identify the genes predisposing to this RA subgroup. The TRAF1/C5 locus in particular warrants further investigation in RA as a potential disease severity locus.
Alanine-scanning mutagenesis of amino acids 21-30, forming cytoplasmic domain Ib in phospholamban (PLN), revealed that mutation to Ala of Asn27, Gln29, and Asn30 results in gain of inhibitory function. In an earlier study (Kimura, Y., Kurzydlowski, K., Tada, M. , and MacLennan, D. H. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 15061-15064), gain of function in PLN transmembrane domain II mutants was correlated with pentamer destabilization, leading to proposals that the PLN monomer is the active inhibitory species, that dissociation of the PLN pentamer is one determinant of PLN inhibitory function and that dissociation of the PLN.cardiac sarco(endo)plasmic Ca2+-ATPase isoform (SERCA2a) complex is a second determinant. Because each of the new domain Ib mutants contained a normal ratio of pentamer to monomer in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, gain of function must have resulted from mechanisms other than destabilization of pentameric structure. Evidence that domain Ib and domain II mutants act through different sites and different mechanisms was provided by a monomeric double mutant, N30A/I40A, in which the enhanced inhibitory function of each single mutant was additive. Evidence for an alteration in stability of the PLN/SERCA2a heterodimer was obtained in a study of double mutant N27A/N34A in which inhibitory function was regained by combining a gain of function, domain Ib mutation with a loss of function domain II mutation. These results support the proposal that PLN inhibition of SERCA2a involves, first, depolymerization of PLN and, second, the formation of inhibitory interactions between monomeric PLN and SERCA2a.
The Muenke syndrome (MS) is characterized by unicoronal or bicoronal craniosynostosis, midfacial hypoplasia, ocular hypertelorism, and a variety of minor abnormalities associated with a mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene. The birth prevalence is approximately one in 10,000 live births, accounting for 8-10% of patients with coronal synostosis. Although MS is a relatively common diagnosis in patients with craniosynostosis syndromes, with autosomal dominant inheritance, there has been no report of MS, in an affected Korean family with typical cephalo-facial morphology that has been confirmed by molecular studies. Here, we report a familial case of MS in a female patient with a Pro250Arg mutation in exon 7 (IgII-IGIII linker domain) of the FGFR3 gene. This patient had mild midfacial hypoplasia, hypertelorism, downslanting palpebral fissures, a beak shaped nose, plagio-brachycephaly, and mild neurodevelopmental delay. The same mutation was confirmed in the patient's mother, two of the mother's sisters and the maternal grandfather. The severity of the cephalo-facial anomalies was variable among these family members.
The growth and differentiation factor bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) regulates cardiac development during vertebrate embryogenesis. In cardiac precursor cells, BMP-2 has recently been shown to induce expression of cardiac transcription factors, including myocyte enhancer factor 2A (MEF-2A). The specific signal transduction mechanism by which BMP-2 regulates these actions is not known. We investigated the role of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase in regulating these processes in cardiomyocyte precursor CL6 cells. BMP-2 increased PI 3-kinase activity in these cells in a time-dependent manner, resulting in increased expression of sarcomeric myosin heavy chain (MHC) and MEF-2A. Inhibition of PI 3-kinase abolished these actions of BMP-2, indicating the involvement of PI 3-kinase in these processes. Furthermore, BMP-2 stimulated specific protein.DNA complex formation when an MEF-2 DNA recognition element was used as probe. Antibody supershift assay confirmed the presence of MEF-2A in this protein.DNA complex. Inhibition of PI 3-kinase activity completely prevented the MEF-2A.DNA complex formation. BMP-2 also increased transcription of a reporter gene driven by an MEF-2-specific DNA element in a PI 3-kinase-dependent manner. Ectopic expression of MEF-2A increased BMP-2 transcription to the same extent induced by BMP-2, indicating that MEF-2A may participate in BMP-2 autoregulation in CL6 cells. Expression of dominant negative PI 3-kinase completely abolished BMP-2-induced as well as MEF-2A-mediated BMP-2 transcription. Furthermore expression of MEF-2A increased MHC expression in a PI 3-kinase-dependent manner. Together these data provide the first evidence that BMP-2-induced PI 3-kinase signaling regulates MEF-2A expression and define a mechanism of MEF-2A-dependent BMP-2 transcription.
Telomerase, the ribonucleoprotein enzyme maintaining the telomeres of eukaryotic chromosomes, is up-regulated in the vast majority of human neoplasias but not in normal somatic tissues. Therefore, the telomerase complex represents a promising universal therapeutic target in cancer. Telomeric G-rich single-stranded DNA can adopt in vitro an intramolecular quadruplex structure, which has been shown to inhibit telomerase activity. We examined G-quadruplex interactive agent, telomestatin (SOT-095), for its ability to inhibit the proliferation of human leukemia cells, including freshly obtained leukemia cells. Telomere length was determined by either the terminal restriction fragment method or flow-FISH, and apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry. Moreover, chemosensitivity was examined in telomestatin-treated U937 cells before ultimate telomere shortening. Treatment with telomestatin reproducibly inhibited telomerase activity in U937 and NB4 cells followed by telomere shortening. Enhanced chemosensitivity toward daunorubicin and cytosine-arabinoside was observed in telomestatin-treated U937 cells, before ultimate telomere shortening. Telomere shortening associated with apoptosis by telomestatin was evident in some freshly obtained leukemia cells from acute myeloid leukemia patients, regardless of sub-types of AML and post-myelodysplasia AML. These results suggest that disruption of telomere maintenance by telomestatin limits the cellular lifespan of AML cells, as well. However, in a minority of AML patients apoptosis was not evident, thus indicating that resistant mechanism might exist in some freshly obtained AML cells. Therefore, further investigation of telomestatin as a therapeutic agent is warranted.
Recently approved and highly specific small-molecule inhibitors of c-MET exon 14 skipping mutations (e.g., capmatinib, tepotinib) are a new and important therapeutic option for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients harbouring c-MET alterations. Several experimental studies have provided compelling evidence that c-MET is involved in the regulation of the immune response by up-regulating inhibitory molecules (e.g., PD-L1) and down-regulating of immune stimulators (e.g., CD137, CD252, CD70, etc.). In addition, c-MET was found to be implicated in the regulation of the inflamed tumour microenvironment (TME) and thereby contributing to an increased immune escape of tumour cells from T cell killing. Moreover, it is a major resistance mechanism following treatment of epidermal growth factor receptor mutations (EGFRmut) with tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitors (TKIs). In line with these findings c-MET alterations have also been shown to be associated with a worse clinical outcome and a poorer prognosis in NSCLC patients. However, the underlying mechanisms for these experimental observations are neither fully evaluated nor conclusive, but clearly multifactorial and most likely tumour-specific. In this regard the clinical efficacy of checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs) and TKIs against EGFRmut in NSCLC patients harbouring c-MET alterations is also not yet established, and further research will certainly provide some guidance as to optimally utilise CPIs and c-MET inhibitors in the future.
OBJECTIVE: To carry out genetic analysis for a fetus with Dandy-Walker malformation and provide prenatal diagnosis for its parents during the subsequent pregnancy.METHODS: Routine G-banding was carried out to analyze the karyotype of the fetus and its parents, and next-generation sequencing (NGS) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) were used to verify the result.RESULTS: The father showed a normal karyotype, while the mother was found to carry a balanced t(11; 22) (q23; q11) translocation. NGS and FISH analysis verified that the supernumerary marker chromosome carried by the fetus was der(22) t(11; 22) (q23;q11). The fetus was diagnosed with Emanuel syndrome. During the next pregnancy, the fetus was found to carry the same balanced translocation as its mother. After genetic counseling, the couple decided to continue with the pregnancy, and eventually delivered a healthy baby.CONCLUSION: A fetal case of Emanuel syndrome has been identified. The derivative der(22) t(11; 22)(q23; q11) chromosome probably underlies the Dandy-Walker malformation in the fetus. Combined cytogenetic and molecular analyses can attain a more precise diagnosis for fetal abnormalities detected by ultrasonography.
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: AKI occurs frequently in older persons. Elevated circulating fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23), a known marker of impaired mineral metabolism, may also reflect tubular dysfunction and risk of AKI. This study evaluated FGF-23 as well as traditional markers of kidney disease, namely urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) and creatinine-cystatin C estimated GFR (eGFRCrCyC), as risk factors for AKI in elderly individuals.DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: Plasma FGF-23, UACR, and eGFRCrCyC were measured in 3241 community-dwelling elderly individuals in the Cardiovascular Health Study. Hospitalization for AKI was defined by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes. Associations of each biomarker with AKI were evaluated using Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for demographics, cardiovascular risk factors, and biomarkers of kidney function.RESULTS: The mean participant age was 78 years; 60% of participants were women and 16% were African American. The median (interquartile range) values of biomarkers were as follows: FGF-23, 70 RU/ml (53, 99); UACR, 8.88 mg/g (4.71, 20.47); and eGFRCrCyC, 71 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) (59, 83). Hospitalized AKI occurred in 119 participants over 10.0 years of median follow-up. In fully adjusted analyses, compared with the lowest quartiles, the highest quartiles of FGF-23 (≥100 RU/ml) and UACR (≥20.9 mg/g) were associated with AKI (FGF-23: hazard ratio [HR], 1.99; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.04 to 3.80; and UACR: HR, 3.35; 95% CI, 1.83 to 6.13). Compared with the highest quartile, the lowest quartile of eGFRCrCyC (<57 ml/min per 1.73 m(2)) was associated with AKI with an HR of 2.15 (95% CI, 1.21 to 3.82).CONCLUSIONS: FGF-23 adjusted for albuminuria, cardiovascular disease risk factors, and baseline eGFR is independently associated with a higher risk of AKI hospitalizations in community-dwelling elderly individuals. Further studies to understand the nature of this association are warranted.
Fanconi anemia (FA) is a multisystem disease, characterized by the triad of physical abnormalities, bone marrow failure, and increased risk for malignancy. In the past few years, data has accumulated regarding fertility issues in FA patients, mostly due to gonadal dysfunction, which is prevalent in FA patients reaching puberty. It seems that attenuated FA phenotype lacking the classical manifestations often is presented with POI or azoospermia. Searching the literature, we summarized data regarding FA patients presenting as suffering from sub/infertility due to gonadal dysfunction, with or without other FA symptoms. We present a summary of the patients having biallelic pathogenic variants in FA genes FANCA, FANCM, BRCA2, and XRCC2 that presented with gonadal dysfunction with or without other phenotypic features of FA. Some were in mosaic, while some are considered hypomorphic, enabling residual protein function. There are also a few descriptions of POI associated with monoallelic pathogenic variants in FANCA, BRCA2, and FANCL. We conclude that the diagnosis of FA in gonadal dysfunction patients is of utmost importance due to its actionability. Follow-up strategies in FA patients are designed to discover early stages of leukemias and solid tumors and thus save lives. The feasibility of next-generation sequencing (NGS) can now ease this diagnostic procedure. An open question is the justification of performing NGS for all isolated azoospermia/POI patients.
Macitentan (Opsumit®) is a novel dual endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA) with sustained receptor binding properties developed by Actelion Pharmaceuticals Ltd. In October 2013, oral macitentan 10 mg once daily received its first global approval in the US, followed closely by Canada, for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). The drug has also received a positive opinion in the EU from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use for the treatment of PAH, and is under regulatory review in several other countries for the same indication. Endothelin (ET)-1 influences pathological changes via two ET receptor subtypes (ETA and ETB), to which it binds with high affinity. ET-1 is implicated in several forms of vascular disease making it a valid target for the treatment of pulmonary vascular diseases such as PAH. Clinical development is underway for other indications, including Eisenmenger syndrome, ischaemic digital ulcers secondary to systemic sclerosis, and glioblastoma. Macitentan was also evaluated in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis; however, a phase 2 trial did not meet its primary endpoint and further investigation in this indication was discontinued. Macitentan was developed by modifying the structure of bosentan in the search for an optimal dual ERA with improved efficacy and tolerability compared with other ERAs. This article summarizes the milestones in the development of macitentan leading to this first approval for PAH.
Occupational neurotoxic diseases have become increasingly common in Taiwan due to industrialization. Over the past 40 years, Taiwan has transformed from an agricultural society to an industrial society. The most common neurotoxic diseases also changed from organophosphate poisoning to heavy metal intoxication, and then to organic solvent and semiconductor agent poisoning. The nervous system is particularly vulnerable to toxic agents because of its high metabolic rate. Neurological manifestations may be transient or permanent, and may range from cognitive dysfunction, cerebellar ataxia, Parkinsonism, sensorimotor neuropathy and autonomic dysfunction to neuromuscular junction disorders. This study attempts to provide a review of the major outbreaks of occupational neurotoxins from 1968 to 2012. A total of 16 occupational neurotoxins, including organophosphates, toxic gases, heavy metals, organic solvents, and other toxic chemicals, were reviewed. Peer-reviewed articles related to the electrophysiology, neuroimaging, treatment and long-term follow up of these neurotoxic diseases were also obtained. The heavy metals involved consisted of lead, manganese, organic tin, mercury, arsenic, and thallium. The organic solvents included n-hexane, toluene, mixed solvents and carbon disulfide. Toxic gases such as carbon monoxide, and hydrogen sulfide were also included, along with toxic chemicals including polychlorinated biphenyls, tetramethylammonium hydroxide, organophosphates, and dimethylamine borane. In addition we attempted to correlate these events to the timeline of industrial development in Taiwan. By researching this topic, the hope is that it may help other developing countries to improve industrial hygiene and promote occupational safety and health care during the process of industrialization.
Serum lipids and thyroxine were determined in 26 men participating in a 90-km cross-country ski race, before, immediately after, and on the following days. Serum cholesterol was unchanged immediately after the race, but then fell significantly and remained low during the observation period. During the race the fatty acid composition of serum free fatty acids changed towards the composition of ordinary adipose tissue. The compostiion of serum triglycerides showed similar but less pronouced changes. On the following days an increase in the arachidonic, and a decrease in the linoleic acid fraction of the total serum lipids were observed. Total thyroxine and free thyroxine in serum were significantly increased at the end of the race, but had returned to the pre-raced levels during the rest of the observation period. The observations correspond to the findings during acute, severe illness, and are compatible with the hypothesis that some of the changes in serum lipids following severe somatic stress are due to increased thyroid hormone activity.
gamma-Secretase is a membrane-embedded multi-protein complex that catalyzes the final cut of the Alzheimer's disease-related amyloid precursor protein (APP) to amyloid-beta peptides of variable length (37-43 amino acids) via an unusual intramembrane cleavage. Recent findings propose that some commonly used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have the ability to modulate specifically gamma-secretase activity without inhibiting the enzyme as a whole. These drugs may shift the processing of APP from the longer amyloid-beta 42 peptide towards shorter, less fibrillogenic and less toxic amyloid-beta species. We hypothesize that gamma-secretase activity, as an enzyme that is strictly associated with cellular membranes, is sensitive to alterations of the hydrophobic membrane environment. Here, we show that the gamma-secretase modulator and amyloid-beta 42-lowering drug sulindac sulfide alters the physical state of the membrane and strongly decreases fluidity of cellular membranes. Furthermore, sulindac sulfide changed the protein composition of membrane microdomains, the so-called lipid rafts. Most significantly, APP C-terminal fragments (CTFs) were redistributed from rafts towards non-raft membrane domains. This could be demonstrated also in cell-free assays, where in addition presenilin-1, the catalytic subunit of the gamma-secretase complex, was shifted out of lipid rafts. Together, these findings suggest that sulindac sulfide directly alters the membrane architecture and shifts the gamma-secretase-mediated cleavage of APP towards a hydrophobic environment where the enzyme-substrate complex is in a conformation for processing preferentially shorter amyloid-beta peptides.
Lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) with a heterozygous mutation in the breast cancer susceptibility gene BRCA1 have been repeatedly used to elucidate the biological consequences of such a mutation with respect to radiation sensitivity and DNA repair deficiency. Our previous results indicated that LCL with a BRCA1 mutation do not generally show the same chromosomal mutagen sensitivity in the micronucleus test as lymphocytes with the same BRCA1 mutation. To further study the radiosensitivity of LCL with a BRCA1 mutation, we now performed comparative investigations with the alkaline (pH 13) and the neutral (pH 8.3) comet assay and pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). These tests are commonly used to determine the repair capacity for DNA double strand breaks (DNA-DSB). Six LCL (three established from women with a heterozygous BRCA1 mutation and three from healthy controls) were investigated. Induction (2 and 5 Gy) of gamma-ray-induced DNA damage and its repair (during 60 min after irradiation) was measured with the alkaline and neutral comet assay. Comparative experiments were performed with PFGE determining the induction of DNA-DSB by 10-50 Gy gamma-irradiation and their repair during 6 h. There was no significant difference between LCL with and without BRCA1 mutation in any of these experiments. Therefore, using these methods, no indication for a delayed repair of DNA-DSB in LCL with a BRCA1 mutation was found. However, these results do not generally exclude DNA-DSB repair deficiency in these cell lines because the methods applied have limited sensitivity and only measure the speed but not the fidelity of the repair process.
Cardiolipin is a major membrane phospholipid in the mitochondria and is essential for cellular energy metabolism mediated through mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Recent studies indicate that it plays a diverse role in cellular metabolism. Eukaryotic cardiolipin is synthesized de novo from phosphatidic acid via the cytidine-5'-diphosphate-1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol pathway and is deacylated to monolysocardiolipin in order for it to be remodelled into the form that is observed in mitochondrial membranes. This resynthesis of deacylated cardiolipin from monolysocardiolipin occurs via the Barth Syndrome gene product tafazzin and acyllysocardiolipin acyltransferase-1, monolysocardiolipin acyltransferase-1 and the alpha subunit of trifunctional protein. Heart failure is a disease condition in which the amount and type of cardiolipin is altered. Several animal models have been generated to study the role of altered cardiolipin in heart failure. In many of these models loss of the tetralinoleoyl-cardiolipin species is observed during the development of the heart failure. In the doxycycline inducible short hairpin RNA tafazzin knock down mouse, loss of tetralinoleoyl-cardiolipin is associated with a mitochondrial bioenergetic disruption. Reduction in mitochondrial supercomplex formation and NADH dehydrogenase activity within these supercomplexes is observed. Modulation of CL fatty acyl composition may serve as a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of several pathologies including cardiac dysfunction.We propose that increasing cardiolipin may improve mitochondrial function and potentially serve as a therapy for diseases which exhibit mitochondrial dysfunction involving reduced cardiolipin.
BACKGROUND: Ranolazine (Ran), an antianginal agent, inhibits late Na(+) current. The purpose of this study was to determine whether there was an added benefit of adding Ran to cardioplegia (CP) in a model of global ischemia/reperfusion.METHODS AND RESULTS: Isolated rat hearts were Langendorff-perfused and exposed to 40-minute normothermic, cardioplegic global ischemia and 30 minutes of reperfusion. Before ischemia and during reperfusion, hearts were treated with no drug (control) or with the late Na(+) current inhibitors Ran (5 micromol/L) or tetrodotoxin (1 micromol/L). Ischemic cardioplegic arrest led to an increase of left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) by > or =20 mm Hg (ie, cardiac contracture). Ten out of 11 hearts treated with CP alone developed contracture, whereas 6 out of 11 hearts treated with CP plus Ran developed contracture. Ran added to CP reduced LVEDP at the end of ischemia from 41+/-5 mm Hg in CP alone to 26+/-3 mm Hg in CP plus Ran (P=0.024). Area under the curve for LVEDP during the entire ischemic period was also smaller in CP plus Ran versus CP alone. The percent increase (from baseline) of LVEDP measured at the end of 30-minute reperfusion was smaller for CP plus Ran (66+/-18%) versus CP alone (287+/-90%; P=0.035). The area under the curve for LVEDP during reperfusion was smaller in CP plus Ran versus CP alone. Tetrodotoxin (1 micromol/L) also reduced cardiac contracture during ischemia/reperfusion, compared to CP alone.CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that Ran may have therapeutic potential as an adjunct to CP and further support a protective role of Na(+) current inhibition during ischemia/reperfusion.
Giant axonal neuropathy (GAN) is a rare pediatric neurodegenerative disease. It is best known for the "giant" axons caused by accumulations of intermediate filaments. The disease is progressive, with onset around age 3 years and death by the third decade of life. GAN results from recessive mutations in the GAN gene encoding gigaxonin, and our analysis of all reported mutations shows that they are distributed throughout the protein structure. Precisely how these mutations cause the disease remains to be determined. In addition to changes in peripheral nerves that are similar to those seen in neuropathies such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 2, GAN patients exhibit a wide range of central nervous system signs. These features, corroborated by degeneration of central tracts apparent from postmortem pathology, indicate that GAN is also a progressive neurodegenerative disease. To reflect this phenotype more precisely, we therefore propose that the disease should be more appropriately referred to as "giant axonal neurodegeneration."
Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is a group of genetic iron overload disorders that manifest with various symptoms, including hepatic dysfunction, diabetes, and cardiomyopathy. Classic HH type 1, which is common in Caucasians, is caused by bi-allelic mutations of HFE. Severe types of HH are caused by either bi-allelic mutations of HFE2 that encodes hemojuvelin (type 2A) or HAMP that encodes hepcidin (type 2B). HH type 3, which is of intermediate severity, is caused by bi-allelic mutations of TFR2 that encodes transferrin receptor 2. Mutations of SLC40A1 that encodes ferroportin, the only cellular iron exporter, causes either HH type 4A (loss-of-function mutations) or HH type 4B (gain-of-function mutations). Studies on these gene products uncovered a part of the mechanisms of the systemic iron regulation; HFE, hemojuvelin, and TFR2 are involved in iron sensing and stimulating hepcidin expression, and hepcidin downregulates the expression of ferroportin of the target cells. Phlebotomy is the standard treatment for HH, and early initiation of the treatment is essential for preventing irreversible organ damage. However, because of the rarity and difficulty in making the genetic diagnosis, a large proportion of patients with non-HFE HH might have been undiagnosed; therefore, awareness of this disorder is important.
Mondor's disease is a superficial thrombophlebitis of the thoracic wall frequently affecting the female breast. In most cases the etiology is unknown, although operation, direct and indirect trauma, are known as causative factors. This material comprises five women, all with Mondor's disease of the breast. One patient did not return for follow-up, in one patient biopsy was performed after 2 weeks. In the remaining three patients the lesion had disappeared after 9 and 10 weeks. Mondor's disease has no relationship to cancer or systemic disease, and no treatment apart from observation is required.
Gene duplications have been broadly implicated in the generation of testis-specific genes. To perform a comprehensive analysis of paralogous testis-biased genes, we characterized the testes transcriptome of Drosophila melanogaster by comparing gene expression in testes vs. ovaries, heads, and gonadectomized males. A number of the identified 399 testis-biased genes code for the known components of mature sperm. Among the detected 69 genes downregulated in testes, a large fraction is required for viability. By analyzing paralogs of testis-biased genes, we identified "co-regulated" paralogous pairs in which both genes are testis biased, "anti-regulated" pairs in which one paralog is testis biased and the other downregulated in testes, and "neutral" pairs in which one paralog is testis biased and the other constitutively expressed. The numbers of identified co-regulated and anti-regulated pairs were higher than expected by chance. Testis-biased genes included in these pairs show decreased frequency of lethal mutations, suggesting their specific role in male reproduction. These genes also show exceptionally high interspecific variability of expression in comparison between D. melanogaster and the closely related D. simulans. Further, interspecific changes in testis bias of expression are generally correlated within the co-regulated pairs and are anti-correlated within the anti-regulated pairs, suggesting coordinated regulation within both types of paralogous gene pairs.
To identify novel regulators of erythropoiesis, we performed independent forward genetic screens using the chemical mutagen ENU in mice. Among progeny displaying microcytic red-cell phenotypes, 7 independent mouse strains harboring mutations within the transferrin receptor gene Tfrc were identified. Six of the mutants, including the previously described red blood cell 6 (RBC6) strain, displayed reduced erythroblast CD71 expression and midgestation lethality of homozygotes (E12.5-E14.5), and 1 novel strain, RBC21, displayed a variable phenotype with sustained CD71 expression and late homozygous lethality (E18.5). Standard iron studies were normal in the RBC21 mutant, but intracellular ferritin was significantly reduced. The microcytic phenotype seen in the RBC21 strain was the result of impaired binding of transferrin to the receptor. Neither RBC6 nor RBC21 responded to iron replacement therapy. These studies describe how point mutations of the transferrin receptor can cause a microcytic anemia that does not respond to iron therapy and would not be detected by routine iron studies, such as serum ferritin.
Background: Although the programmed death 1 (PD-1)/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors have markedly changed the strategies of cancer treatment, most patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) do not respond to PD-1/PD-L1 monotherapy. Epigenetic drugs have been hypothesized to possess the potential to sensitize PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. Case Presentation: Three patients with advanced metastatic NSCLC failed to respond to first-line systemic therapy and had a low tumor mutation burden, low tumor neoantigen burden, low microsatellite instability, and HLA loss of heterozygosity according to their target lesion biopsies, all of which were considered unfavorable factors for PD-1/PD-L1 blockage. However, all three patients responded to low-dose decitabine, an epigenetic drug, in combination with camrelizumab (anti-PD-1 antibody), with only controllable adverse events, indicating that low-dose decitabine can sensitize PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. Summary: We report a novel therapy with low-dose decitabine plus camrelizumab for advanced NSCLC on the basis of successful treatment of three patients, emphasizing the potential of epigenetic drugs to regulate PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in advanced NSCLC.
Recently, several promising treatments have emerged for neuromuscular disorders, highlighting the need for robust biomarkers for monitoring therapeutic efficacy and maintenance of the therapeutic effect. Several studies have proposed circulating and tissue biomarkers, but none of them has been validated to monitor acute and long-term drug response. We previously described how the myostatin (MSTN) level is naturally downregulated in several neuromuscular diseases, including Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Here, we show that the dystrophin-deficient Golden Retriever muscular dystrophy (GRMD) dog model also presents an intrinsic loss of Mstn production in muscle. The abnormally low levels of Mstn observed in the GRMD dog puppies at 2 months were partially rescued at both mRNA and protein level after adeno-associated virus (AAV)-microdystrophin treatment in a dose-dependent manner. These results show that circulating Mstn is a robust and reliable quantitative biomarker, capable of measuring a therapeutic response to pharmaco-gene therapy in real time in the neuromuscular system, as well as a quantitative means for non-invasive follow-up of a therapeutic effect. Moreover, a 2-year follow-up also suggests that Mstn could be a longitudinal monitoring tool to follow maintenance or decrease of the therapeutic effect.
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Inflammatory mediators, including adipokines, have been studied in migraine pathophysiology; however, their role is not yet well established. The aim of the present study was to investigate adiponectin (ADP) and its association with clinical parameters and psychiatric comorbidities in migraine patients compared with controls.METHODS: This was a cross sectional study including migraine patients and controls. Beck depression and anxiety inventories, Headache impact test, and Allodynia symptom checklist were recorded. Adiponectin was measured by ELISA.RESULTS: Sixty-eight migraine patients and sixty-five controls without headache were included. The ADP levels were significantly higher among patients with migraine (43.6±11.8 versus 36.6±9.7 ng/mL, P<0.0001). Adiponectin levels were not correlated with depression and anxiety scores, as well as with migraine severity and allodynia scores.CONCLUSION: ADP levels were raised in migraine, independently of psychiatric comorbidities, migraine impact, and allodynia.
Two types of chemotherapy used in the treatment of patients with malignant glioma are carboplatin and Gliadel wafer [(3.85% 1,3-bis-(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU)]. To date there have been no published data examining their concurrent use in this disease. The purpose of this study was to evaluate combination chemotherapy with Gliadel wafer and carboplatin in patients with high-grade, malignant glioma. In this prospective phase I study, 16 patients underwent surgery, Gliadel wafer implantation (up to 8 wafers), intravenous carboplatin given postoperatively (day 3 or 4) at a dose escalation range of area under the curve (AUC)=2-6, and external beam radiation. Median age was 55 years (range 27-66 years). Fourteen (88%) patients had glioblastoma multiforme and 2 (12%) had anaplastic astrocytoma. Performance status was as follows: Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)=0 (2 patients), ECOG=1 (13 patients), and ECOG=2 (2 patients). Three patients were treated at each dosing level (AUC=2-6), and 4 patients were treated at an AUC=5. Carboplatin was administered to all patients by postoperative day 4. Radiation was begun on day 14-36. No grade 3 or 4 toxicities were noted in this study. Median progression-free and overall survival was 266 and 679 days, respectively. We conclude that administering systemic carboplatin is safe and well tolerated in the postoperative period immediately following resection and implantation of Gliadel wafer for the treatment of malignant glioma. Further evaluation in a phase II setting, at maximal carboplatin dose to establish potential efficacy, with this combination is warranted.
Noncompaction of the ventricular myocardium (NVM) is the morphological hallmark of a rare familial or sporadic unclassified heart disease of heterogeneous origin. NVM results presumably from a congenital developmental error and has been traced back to single point mutations in various genes. The objective of this study was to determine the underlying genetic defect in a large German family suffering from NVM. Twenty four family members were clinically assessed using advanced imaging techniques. For molecular characterization, a genome-wide linkage analysis was undertaken and the disease locus was mapped to chromosome 14ptel-14q12. Subsequently, two genes of the disease interval, MYH6 and MYH7 (encoding the alpha- and beta-myosin heavy chain, respectively) were sequenced, leading to the identification of a previously unknown de novo missense mutation, c.842G>C, in the gene MYH7. The mutation affects a highly conserved amino acid in the myosin subfragment-1 (R281T). In silico simulations suggest that the mutation R281T prevents the formation of a salt bridge between residues R281 and D325, thereby destabilizing the myosin head. The mutation was exclusively present in morphologically affected family members. A few members of the family displayed NVM in combination with other heart defects, such as dislocation of the tricuspid valve (Ebstein's anomaly, EA) and atrial septal defect (ASD). A high degree of clinical variability was observed, ranging from the absence of symptoms in childhood to cardiac death in the third decade of life. The data presented in this report provide first evidence that a mutation in a sarcomeric protein can cause noncompaction of the ventricular myocardium.
The Genome 10K project aims to sequence the genomes of 10,000 vertebrates, representing approximately one genome for each vertebrate genus. Since fishes (cartilaginous fishes, ray-finned fishes and lobe-finned fishes) represent more than 50% of extant vertebrates, it is planned to target 4,000 fish genomes. At present, nearly 60 fish genomes are being sequenced at various public funded labs, and under a Genome 10K and BGI pilot project. An additional 100 fishes have been identified for sequencing in the next phase of Genome 10K project.
We examined the therapeutic effect of 15-DOS in the two models of acute and chronic relapsing EAE in Lewis rats. In the first model adult rats developed an acute severe EAE and by day 16 all animals died. Lewis rats treated with 15-DOS showed a delayed and reduced onset of clinical symptoms and mortality was prevented. In the second model Lewis rats (aged animals) developed a chronic relapsing EAE with up to three relapses. The second and third episodes were both milder and shorter in duration. All animals treated with 15-DOS survived the delayed first attack and developed no further relapses.
Recent clinical data suggest remarkable activity of ibrutinib, the first-in-class covalent inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), as well as excellent activity in other B cell malignancies, including in particular mantle cell lymphoma and Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia. This review evaluates the data from ongoing clinical and correlative studies of ibrutinib in B cell malignancies with a particular focus on CLL, and considers these data in the context of other B cell receptor pathway inhibitors.
Following chronic liver injury, hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) transdifferentiate into myofibroblast-like cells, which develop contractile properties and contribute to increased resistance to blood flow. We investigated whether this phenotypic activation includes changes in the expression of L-type voltage-operated Ca2+ channels (VOCC), which mediate Ca2+ influx and regulate cell contraction in vascular cell types. Rat HSCs were studied in the quiescent phenotype and after their activation in vitro (cultured on plastic for 14 days) and in vivo (isolated from rats with CCl(4)-induced cirrhosis). Patch-clamp studies showed Ca2+ currents through L-type VOCC in HSCs activated both in vitro and in vivo, whereas no currents were detected in quiescent HSCs. Moreover, binding studies with (3)H-isradipine, a specific L-type VOCC antagonist, showed a large number of binding sites in activated HSCs, while no specific binding was found in quiescent HSCs. Finally, messenger RNA (mRNA) encoding L-type VOCC was not detected in quiescent HSCs as assessed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Northern blot analysis, whereas it was present in activated HSCs. Stimulation of L-type VOCC with KCl resulted in a marked increase in [Ca2+](i) followed by cell contraction in HSCs activated both in vitro and in vivo, whereas no effects were observed in quiescent HSCs. We conclude that the activation of HSCs is associated with up-regulation of L-type VOCC that mediate Ca2+ influx and cell contraction. These results may be relevant to the pathogenesis of portal hypertension.
BACKGROUND: Differential expression (DE) analysis of RNA-seq data still poses inferential challenges, such as handling of transcripts characterized by low expression levels. In this study, we use a plasmode-based approach to assess the relative performance of alternative inferential strategies on RNA-seq transcripts, with special emphasis on transcripts characterized by a small number of read counts, so-called low-count transcripts, as motivated by an ecological application in prairie grasses. Big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii) is a wide-ranging dominant prairie grass of ecological and agricultural importance to the US Midwest while edaphic subspecies sand bluestem (A. gerardii ssp. Hallii) grows exclusively on sand dunes. Relative to big bluestem, sand bluestem exhibits qualitative phenotypic divergence consistent with enhanced drought tolerance, plausibly associated with transcripts of low expression levels. Our dataset consists of RNA-seq read counts for 25,582 transcripts (60% of which are classified as low-count) collected from leaf tissue of individual plants of big bluestem (n = 4) and sand bluestem (n = 4). Focused on low-count transcripts, we compare alternative ad-hoc data filtering techniques commonly used in RNA-seq pipelines and assess the inferential performance of recently developed statistical methods for DE analysis, namely DESeq2 and edgeR robust. These methods attempt to overcome the inherently noisy behavior of low-count transcripts by either shrinkage or differential weighting of observations, respectively.RESULTS: Both DE methods seemed to properly control family-wise type 1 error on low-count transcripts, whereas edgeR robust showed greater power and DESeq2 showed greater precision and accuracy. However, specification of the degree of freedom parameter under edgeR robust had a non-trivial impact on inference and should be handled carefully. When properly specified, both DE methods showed overall promising inferential performance on low-count transcripts, suggesting that ad-hoc data filtering steps at arbitrary expression thresholds may be unnecessary. A note of caution is in order regarding the approximate nature of DE tests under both methods.CONCLUSIONS: Practical recommendations for DE inference are provided when low-count RNA-seq transcripts are of interest, as is the case in the comparison of subspecies of bluestem grasses. Insights from this study may also be relevant to other applications focused on transcripts of low expression levels.
We investigated the effect of a heat-shock protein co-inducer, arimoclomol (CytRx, LA, CA), on hypoxia-adaptive responses using a rat model of simulated altitude exposure (hypobaric hypoxia).Cognitive function was measured using a T-maze and an object recognition test.Motor function was measured using an inclined-screen test and an adhesion removal test. Immunohistochemical analyses were assessed in brain for heat-shock protein 70 (HSP 70), intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM- 1) and apoptosis (TUNEL staining). Results show that both cognitive and motor performances were improved in rats treated with arimoclomol during hypoxic exposure; the hypoxia-induced expression of HSP70 and ICAM-1, and TUNEL-positive cells were reduced in brain with the treatment.Our data suggest that the arimoclomol treatment reduces the hypoxia-induced stress in brain tissue, and also improves the behavioral performance in rats during hypoxic adaptation.
OBJECTIVE: Prospective pharmacogenetic screening for the human leucocyte antigen (HLA) B*5701 allele can significantly reduce the number of cases of abacavir-related hypersensitivity among HIV-infected patients treated with this drug. The aim of this study was to establish the frequency of the HLA B*5701 variant in HIV-infected Poles.METHODS: The sequence-specific primer (SSP) test was used to assess the feasibility of the introduction of such testing in clinical practice. For this purpose, 234 randomly selected HIV-positive patients were screened using a low-resolution SSP assay, with HLA B*5701-positive results confirmed using a high-resolution test.RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The HLA B*5701 variant was found in 11 of 234 subjects (4.7%). Testing with the selected method proved quick and reliable.
OBJECTIVES: EREG (epiregulin), a member of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family, plays a role in inflammation, wound healing, normal physiology and malignancies. However, little is known about its function on hair growth.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cell growth assay, QPCR and immunostaining were carried out. Telogen-to-anagen transition and organ culture were conducted. ROS level was monitored by staining DCFDA.RESULTS: We investigated the hair inductive effect of EREG and the mechanism of stimulation on DPCs and ORS cells during hair cycling. Whereas EREG promoted hair growth, EREG knockdown inhibited hair growth as evidenced by telogen-to-anagen transition and organ culture models. EREG was expressed in epidermal cells including ORS cells in vivo. EREG activated phospho-ErbB4 in DPCs during hair cycling and stimulated DPCs via ErbB4 activation in vitro. In terms of the underlying mechanism, reactive oxygen species (ROS) played a key role in DPC stimulation. EREG also activated phospho-EGF receptor (EGFR) in epidermal cells including matrix and ORS cells in vivo and stimulated ORS cells via EGFR activation in vitro.CONCLUSIONS: EREG, which is released from ORS cells, activated EGFR and ErbB4 on epidermal cells and DPCs during hair cycling, respectively. As a result, EREG stimulated epidermal cells a positive feedback and DPCs via regulating ROS generation for hair growth. Therefore, EREG therapy may be a novel solution for hair loss treatment.
Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are chronic relapsing and remitting disorders that have varying degrees of severity. However multiple studies have confirmed that a large proportion of patients on maintenance treatment lose response to anti-TNF therapy. This has led to increasing interest in the concept of 'switching therapy out-of-class' i.e. a nonanti- TNF antibody when patients either fail to respond (primary non-response, develop secondary non-response) or do not tolerate anti-TNF therapies. The most widely known and studied alternative class of antibodies therapies at present are the selective adhesion molecule inhibitors. Several antibodies exist which constitute selection adhesion molecule inhibitors, including Natalizumab, MLN-0002 (Vedolizumab) and ISIS 2302 (Alicaforsen) will be discussed in this review.
INTRODUCTION: Necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum is a rare disease of unclear etiology, that occurs in about 1% of diabetic patients.CASE REPORT: We present case of granulomatosis disciformis chronica et progressiva Miescher with good response to systemic corticosteroids therapy.Patient 45 years old woman, with primary yellow-brown areas skin lesions, with foci well separated from surroundings on both lower legs, that occurred 5 years ago. In laboratory tests there was no abnormalities. Because of advance suggestion (after last admit in dermatological ward) of observation according to xantogranuloma necrobioticum tests for paraproteinemia were made. Immunoelectrophoresis, IgG, IgM, IgA levels, kappa light chain, lambda heavy chain; were correct, Bence-Johns protein-negative. During hospitalization in Clinic methylprednisolone in dose of 32 mg od, vascular drugs and local steroidotherapy was applied with good therapeutic response.CONCLUSION: We described case of typical clinical and histological characters of necrobiosis lipoidica. without diabetes-granulomatosis disciformis chronica et progressiva Miescher that despite of suspicion of proper diagnosis for a long time was not treat effective.
Vision screening tests within the limits of industrial medicine examinations, together with physical examinations, were done on human individuals by means of pseudo-isochromatic charts in order to detect "red-green blindness". The tests were carried out on 1589 individuals (males and females) from 10 medium-scale plants of the Saarbrücken area (Federal Republic of Germany). The results obtained from male individuals by 919 Ishihara-tests were only considered, categorized and graphically represented according to their age groups. The data have been collected from the cases examined mostly between the years 1976 to 1977. About 1500 cases were examined per year. Because the samples were not selected at random, one has to be cautious with regard to the statistical interpretations of the results. However, due to the large number of cases included in the study, it can be statistically represented. The histogram illustrating the distribution of colour-vision deficiency, according to each age group, shows the highest peak at an age range of 30 to 35 years. This indicates that a considerable number of cases with colour-vision deficiency was discovered late. The individuals have to be early examined by school physicians, house physicians, occupational physicians, internists or ophthalmologists with this colour-vision screening test, before they enter professional life. Some symptomatical complexes of internal diseases and human genetics, i.e. related to "colour-vision blindness" are also emphasized hemophilia and hemolytic anemia due to glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency.
The purpose of this study was the assessment of the feasibility of dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) studies with fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) to quantify effects of the cyclic Arg-Gly-Asp peptide cilengitide, which targets the ανβ 3 and ανβ 5 integrin receptors in rats with breast cancer bone metastases. Rats were inoculated with MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, followed by the development of lytic lesions in the hind leg. Rats with lytic lesions were treated with cilengitide five times weekly on a continuous basis from days 30 to 55 after tumor cell inoculation. Dynamic PET studies with (18)F-FDG were performed in untreated (n=9), controlled (n=4) and treated rats (n=6). The data were assessed using learning-machine two-tissue compartmental analysis. The (18)F-FDG kinetic parameters obtained by two-tissue compartmental model learning-machine showed significant differences when individual parameters were compared between the control group and treated animals. Quantitative assessment of the tracer kinetics and the application of classification analysis to the data provided us with evidence to identify those tumors that demonstrated effect of cilengitide treatment. The transport rate K1 and the phosphorylation rate k3 were significantly different (P=0.033 and 0.038, respectively). Classification analysis based on support vector machines ranking feature elimination of the combination of PET parameters revealed an overall accuracy of 80.0% between treated animals and the control group. We were able to identify 83.3% treated animals compared with the control group based on k2 and VB. In conclusion, the results revealed that cilengitide treatment of experimental breast cancer bone metastases had a significant therapeutic impact on (18)F-FDG kinetics.
BACKGROUND: Mutations in calcium-responsive transactivator (CREST) encoding gene have been recently linked to ALS. Similar to several proteins implicated in ALS, CREST contains a prion-like domain and was reported to be a component of paraspeckles.RESULTS: We demonstrate that CREST is prone to aggregation and co-aggregates with FUS but not with other two ALS-linked proteins, TDP-43 and TAF15, in cultured cells. Aggregation of CREST affects paraspeckle integrity, probably by trapping other paraspeckle proteins within aggregates. Like several other ALS-associated proteins, CREST is recruited to induced stress granules. Neither of the CREST mutations described in ALS alters its subcellular localization, stress granule recruitment or detergent solubility; however Q388stop mutation results in elevated steady-state levels and more frequent nuclear aggregation of the protein. Both wild-type protein and its mutants negatively affect neurite network complexity of unstimulated cultured neurons when overexpressed, with Q388stop mutation being the most deleterious. When overexpressed in the fly eye, wild-type CREST or its mutants lead to severe retinal degeneration without obvious differences between the variants.CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that CREST and certain other ALS-linked proteins share several features implicated in ALS pathogenesis, namely the ability to aggregate, be recruited to stress granules and alter paraspeckle integrity. A change in CREST levels in neurons which might occur under pathological conditions would have a profound negative effect on neuronal homeostasis.
BACKGROUND: Protein kinases are among the largest druggable family of signaling proteins, involved in various human diseases, including cancers and neurodegenerative disorders. Despite their clinical relevance, nearly 30% of the 545 human protein kinases remain highly understudied. Comparative genomics is a powerful approach for predicting and investigating the functions of understudied kinases. However, an incomplete knowledge of kinase orthologs across fully sequenced kinomes severely limits the application of comparative genomics approaches for illuminating understudied kinases. Here, we introduce KinOrtho, a query- and graph-based orthology inference method that combines full-length and domain-based approaches to map one-to-one kinase orthologs across 17 thousand species.RESULTS: Using multiple metrics, we show that KinOrtho performed better than existing methods in identifying kinase orthologs across evolutionarily divergent species and eliminated potential false positives by flagging sequences without a proper kinase domain for further evaluation. We demonstrate the advantage of using domain-based approaches for identifying domain fusion events, highlighting a case between an understudied serine/threonine kinase TAOK1 and a metabolic kinase PIK3C2A with high co-expression in human cells. We also identify evolutionary fission events involving the understudied OBSCN kinase domains, further highlighting the value of domain-based orthology inference approaches. Using KinOrtho-defined orthologs, Gene Ontology annotations, and machine learning, we propose putative biological functions of several understudied kinases, including the role of TP53RK in cell cycle checkpoint(s), the involvement of TSSK3 and TSSK6 in acrosomal vesicle localization, and potential functions for the ULK4 pseudokinase in neuronal development.CONCLUSIONS: In sum, KinOrtho presents a novel query-based tool to identify one-to-one orthologous relationships across thousands of proteomes that can be applied to any protein family of interest. We exploit KinOrtho here to identify kinase orthologs and show that its well-curated kinome ortholog set can serve as a valuable resource for illuminating understudied kinases, and the KinOrtho framework can be extended to any protein-family of interest.
More than 50 interventions have been used to treat hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), and so therapy decisions can be challenging. Our objective was to summarize and appraise randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence for HS interventions in adults. Searches were conducted in Medline, Embase, CENTRAL, LILACS, five trials registers and abstracts from eight dermatology conferences until 13 August 2015. Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility, extracted data and assessed methodological quality. Primary outcomes were quality of life and adverse effects of the interventions. Twelve trials, from 1983 to 2015, investigating 15 different interventions met our inclusion criteria. The median trial duration was 16 weeks and the median number of participants was 27. Adalimumab 40 mg weekly improved the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) by 4·0 points, which equates to the minimal clinically important difference for the scale, compared with placebo (95% confidence interval -6·5 to -1·5 points). Evidence quality was reduced to 'moderate' because the results are based on only a single study. Adalimumab 40 mg every other week was ineffective in a meta-analysis of two studies comprising 124 participants. Infliximab 5 mg kg(-1) improved the DLQI score by 8·4 points after 8 weeks in a moderate-quality study completed by 33 of 38 participants. Etanercept 50 mg twice weekly was ineffective. Inclusion of a gentamicin sponge prior to primary closure did not improve outcomes. Other interventions, including topical and oral antibiotics, were investigated by relatively small studies, preventing treatment recommendations due to imprecision. More, larger RCTs are required to investigate most HS interventions, particularly oral treatments and surgical therapy. Moderate-quality evidence suggests that adalimumab given weekly and infliximab are effective, whereas adalimumab every other week is ineffective.
YqjH and YqjW are Bacillus subtilis homologs of the UmuC/DinB or Y superfamily of DNA polymerases that are involved in SOS-induced mutagenesis in Escherichia coli. While the functions of YqjH and YqjW in B. subtilis are still unclear, the comparisons of protein structures demonstrate that YqjH has 36% identity to E. coli DNA polymerase IV (DinB protein), and YqjW has 26% identity to E. coli DNA polymerase V (UmuC protein). In this report, we demonstrate that both YqjH and the products of the yqjW operon are involved in UV-induced mutagenesis in this bacterium. Furthermore, resistance to UV-induced damage is significantly reduced in cells lacking a functional YqjH protein. Analysis of stationary-phase mutagenesis indicates that absences of YqjH, but not that of YqjW, decreases the ability of B. subtilis to generate revertants at the hisC952 allele via this system. These data suggest a role for YqjH in the generation of at least some types of stationary-phase-induced mutagenesis.
The paramyxovirus genome, a nonsegmented, negative-polarity, single-stranded RNA of approximately 15 kb, contains six transcription units flanked at the 3' and 5' ends by a short (approximately 50- to 60-nucleotide) extracistronic sequence, dubbed the positive and negative leader regions. These leader template regions, present at the 3' end of the genome and the antigenome, have been shown to contain essential signals governing RNA replication activity. Whether they are sufficient to promote replication is still open to question. By using a series of Sendai virus defective interfering RNAs carrying a nested set of deletions in the promoter regions, it is shown here that for both the genomic and antigenomic promoters, a 3'-end RNA sequence of 96 nucleotides is required to allow replication. Sequence comparison of active and inactive promoters led to the identification of a set of three nucleotide hexamers (nucleotides 79 to 84, 85 to 90, and 91 to 96) containing a repeated motif RXXYXX [shown as 5'-3' positive-strand]. Sequential mutation of each hexamer into its complementary sequence confirmed their essential role. The three hexamers are required, and their relative positioning is important, since displacing them by 6 nucleotides destroyed promoter function. RNAs carrying degenerate nucleotides in the three hexamers were used as replication templates. They led to the selection of actively replicating RNA species exclusively carrying the basic motif (GNNNNN)3 from nucleotides 79 to 96. These results clearly show that, apart from the region from nucleotides 1 to 31, previously identified as governing Sendai virus replication activity, a second element, spanning at the most nucleotides 79 to 96, appears essential. Thus, the paramyxovirus replication promoters are not confined to the leader template regions, as seems to be the case for the rhabdoviruses.
Synemin is a unique cytoplasmic intermediate filament protein for which there is limited understanding of its exact cellular functions. The single human synemin gene encodes at least two splice variants named alpha-synemin and beta-synemin, with the larger alpha-synemin containing an additional 312 amino acid insert within the C-terminal tail domain. We report herein that, by using the entire tail domain of the smaller beta-synemin as the bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen of a human skeletal muscle cDNA library, the LIM domain protein zyxin was identified as an interaction partner for human synemin. The synemin binding site in human zyxin was subsequently mapped to the C-terminal three tandem LIM-domain repeats, whereas the binding site for zyxin within beta-synemin is within the C-terminal 332 amino acid region (SNbetaTII) at the end of the long tail domain. Transient expression of SNbetaTII within mammalian cells markedly reduced zyxin protein level, blocked localization of zyxin at focal adhesion sites and resulted in decreased cell adhesion and increased motility. Knockdown of synemin expression with siRNAs within mammalian cells resulted in significantly compromised cell adhesion and cell motility. Our results suggest that synemin participates in focal adhesion dynamics and is essential for cell adhesion and migration.
As epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has been reported to be a radiation response modulator, HER inhibitors are regarded to act as potential radiosensitisers. Our study examined the role of nimotuzumab and cetuximab both, the two monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to EGFR, as radiosensitisers in a murine glioma model in vivo. Co-administration of both the antibodies with radiation increased the radiosensitivity of U87MG, resulting in a significant delay of subcutaneous (s.c.) tumour growth. Furthermore, the addition of antibodies to the radiation decreased brain tumour sizes and is inhibited by 40-80% the increased tumour cell invasion provoked by radiotherapy, although promoted tumour cell apoptosis. Whereas nimotuzumab led to a reduction in the size of tumour blood vessels and proliferating cells in s.c. tumours, cetuximab had no significant antiangiogenic nor antiproliferative activity. In contrast, cetuximab induced a more marked inhibition of EGFR downstream signalling compared with nimotuzumab. Moreover, both antibodies reduced the total number of radioresistant CD133+ cancer stem cells (CSCs). These results were encouraging, and showed the superiority of combined treatment of mAbs to EGFR and radiation over each single therapy against glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), confirming the role of these drugs as radiosensitisers in human GBM. In addition, we first showed the ability of mAb specifics against EGFR to target radioresistant glioma CSC, supporting the potential use in patients.
BACKGROUND: The spinal metastasis occurs in up to 40% of cancer patient. We compared the Tokuhashi and Tomita scoring systems, two commonly used scoring systems for prognosis in spinal metastases. We also assessed the different variables separately with respect to their value in predicting postsurgical life expectancy. Finally, we suggest criteria for selecting patients for surgery based on the postoperative survival pattern.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 102 patients who had been operated for metastatic disease of the spine. Predictive scoring was done according to the scoring systems proposed by Tokuhashi and Tomita. Overall survival was assessed using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Using the log rank test and Cox regression model we assessed the value of the individual components of each scoring system for predicting survival in these patients.RESULT: The factors that were most significantly associated with survival were the general condition score (Karnofsky Performance Scale) (P=.000, log rank test), metastasis to internal organs (P=.0002 log rank test), and number of extraspinal bone metastases (P=.0058). Type of primary tumor was not found to be significantly associated with survival according to the revised Tokuhashi scoring system (P=.9131, log rank test). Stepwise logistic regression revealed that the Tomita score correlated more closely with survival than the Tokuhashi score.CONCLUSION: The patient's performance status, extent of visceral metastasis, and extent of bone metastases are significant predictors of survival in patients with metastatic disease. Both revised Tokuhashi and Tomita scores were significantly correlated with survival. A revised Tokuhashi score of 7 or more and a Tomita score of 6 or less indicated >50% chance of surviving 6 months postoperatively. We recommend that the Tomita score be used for prognostication in patients who are contemplating surgery, as it is simpler to score and has a higher strength of correlation with survival than the Tokuhashi score.
Transcranial magnetic resonance imaging-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound (MRgHIFU) is gaining attention as a potent substitute for surgical intervention in the treatment of neurologic disorders. To discern the neurophysiologic correlates of its therapeutic effects, we applied MRgHIFU to an intractable neurologic disorder, essential tremor, while measuring magnetoencephalogram mu rhythms from the motor cortex. Focused ultrasound sonication destroyed tissues by focusing a high-energy beam on the ventralis intermedius nucleus of the thalamus. The post-treatment effectiveness was also evaluated using the clinical rating scale for tremors. Thalamic MRgHIFU had substantial therapeutic effects on patients, based on MRgHIFU-mediated improvements in movement control and significant changes in brain mu rhythms. Ultrasonic thalamotomy may reduce hyper-excitable activity in the motor cortex, resulting in normalized behavioral activity after sonication treatment. Thus, non-invasive and spatially accurate MRgHIFU technology can serve as a potent therapeutic tool with broad clinical applications.
Hepatolithiasis is a common disease that represents a serious health threat to the Chinese population. The pathological mechanism underlying hepatolithiasis is closely related to bacterial infections of the intrahepatic bile duct, followed by chronic inflammation and the overexpression of mucin 5AC (MUC5AC). However, the exact mechanism responsible for the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)‑induced upregulation of MUC5AC has yet to be elucidated. Specificity protein 1 (Sp1) is a ubiquitous transcription factor that plays a vital role in the regulation of a number of genes that are responsible for normal cellular function. microRNA (miR/miRNA)‑130b is a member of the miRNA family. miRNAs can bind to the 3'‑untralsated region (3'‑UTR) of a target gene and influence its expression levels. The present study found that LPS increases the expression of MUC5AC by influencing Sp1 secretion. Chromatin immunoprecipitation‑quantitative PCR experiments further verified three Sp1 binding sites in the MUC5AC promoter sequence that can regulate the expression of MUC5AC. Further analysis demonstrated that Sp1 expression was regulated by miR‑130b. Luciferase experiments identified one miR‑130b binding site in the Sp1 3'‑UTR region. In vivo experiments also confirmed the role of the miR‑130b‑Sp1‑MUC5AC signaling pathway in the formation of biliary stones and indicated that this pathway may provide targeted therapeutic strategies for the treatment of intrahepatic bile duct stones.
The general transcription factor TFIIB plays a central role in preinitiation complex (PIC) assembly and the recruitment of RNA polymerase II (RNA pol II) to the promoter. Recent studies have revealed that TFIIB engages in contact with the transcription termination region and also with complexes that are involved in 3' end processing and/or termination. Here we report that TFIIB can be phosphorylated within the N terminus at serine 65 in vivo and that the phosphorylated form of TFIIB is present within (PICs). Surprisingly, TFIIB serine 65 phosphorylation is required after the phosphorylation of serine 5 of RNA pol II C-terminal domain (CTD) has occurred, but before productive transcription initiation begins. We show that phosphorylation of TFIIB at serine 65 regulates the interaction between TFIIB and the CstF-64 component of the CstF 3' cleavage and polyadenylation complex. This directs the recruitment of CstF (cleavage stimulatory factor) to the terminator and also the recruitment of the CstF and CPSF (cleavage and polyadenylation specific factor) complexes to the promoter. Our results reveal that phosphorylation of TFIIB is a critical event in transcription that links the gene promoter and terminator and triggers initiation by RNA pol II.
Alpha-synuclein accumulates in the brains of sporadic Parkinson's disease patients as a major component of Lewy bodies, and mutations in alpha-synuclein are associated with familial forms of Parkinson's disease. The pathogenic mechanisms that precede and promote the aggregation of alpha-synuclein into Lewy bodies in neurons remain to be determined. Here, we constructed a series of alpha-synuclein-enhanced green fluorescent protein (alpha-synucleinEGFP, SynEGFP) fusion proteins to address whether the Parkinson's disease-associated mutations alter the subcellular distribution of alpha-synuclein, and to use as a tool for experimental manipulations to induce aggregate formation. When transfected into mouse cultured primary neurons, the 49-kDa alpha-synucleinEGFP fusion proteins are partially truncated to a approximately 27-kDa form. This non-fluorescent carboxy-terminally modified fusion protein spontaneously forms inclusions in the neuronal cytoplasm. A marked increase in the accumulation of inclusions is detected following treatment with each of three proteasome inhibitors, n-acetyl-leu-leu-norleucinal, lactacystin and MG132. Interestingly, Ala30Pro alpha-synucleinEGFP does not form the cytoplasmic inclusions that are characteristic of wild-type and Ala53Thr alpha-synucleinEGFP, supporting the idea that the Ala30Pro alpha-synuclein protein conformation differs from wild-type alpha-synuclein. Similar inclusions are formed if alpha-synuclein carboxy-terminus is modified by the addition of a V5/6xHistidine epitope tag. By contrast, overexpression of unmodified alpha-synuclein does not lead to aggregate formation. Furthermore, synphilin-1, an alpha-synuclein interacting protein also found in Lewy bodies, colocalizes with the carboxy-terminally truncated alpha-synuclein fusion protein in discrete cytoplasmic inclusions.Our finding that manipulations of the carboxy-terminus of alpha-synuclein lead to inclusion formation may provide a model for studies of the pathogenic mechanisms of alpha-synuclein aggregation in Lewy bodies.

Previous studies have shown a consistent association between long-term use of mobile and cordless phones and glioma and acoustic neuroma, but not for meningioma. When used these phones emit radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMFs) and the brain is the main target organ for the handheld phone. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified in May, 2011 RF-EMF as a group 2B, i.e. a 'possible' human carcinogen. The aim of this study was to further explore the relationship between especially long-term (>10 years) use of wireless phones and the development of malignant brain tumours. We conducted a new case-control study of brain tumour cases of both genders aged 18-75 years and diagnosed during 2007-2009. One population-based control matched on gender and age (within 5 years) was used to each case. Here, we report on malignant cases including all available controls. Exposures on e.g. use of mobile phones and cordless phones were assessed by a self-administered questionnaire. Unconditional logistic regression analysis was performed, adjusting for age, gender, year of diagnosis and socio-economic index using the whole control sample. Of the cases with a malignant brain tumour, 87% (n=593) participated, and 85% (n=1,368) of controls in the whole study answered the questionnaire. The odds ratio (OR) for mobile phone use of the analogue type was 1.8, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.04‑3.3, increasing with >25 years of latency (time since first exposure) to an OR=3.3, 95% CI=1.6-6.9. Digital 2G mobile phone use rendered an OR=1.6, 95% CI=0.996-2.7, increasing with latency >15-20 years to an OR=2.1, 95% CI=1.2-3.6. The results for cordless phone use were OR=1.7, 95% CI=1.1-2.9, and, for latency of 15-20 years, the OR=2.1, 95% CI=1.2-3.8. Few participants had used a cordless phone for >20-25 years. Digital type of wireless phones (2G and 3G mobile phones, cordless phones) gave increased risk with latency >1-5 years, then a lower risk in the following latency groups, but again increasing risk with latency >15-20 years. Ipsilateral use resulted in a higher risk than contralateral mobile and cordless phone use. Higher ORs were calculated for tumours in the temporal and overlapping lobes. Using the meningioma cases in the same study as reference entity gave somewhat higher ORs indicating that the results were unlikely to be explained by recall or observational bias. This study confirmed previous results of an association between mobile and cordless phone use and malignant brain tumours. These findings provide support for the hypothesis that RF-EMFs play a role both in the initiation and promotion stages of carcinogenesis.
Cariprazine (Vraylar) is an oral atypical antipsychotic originated by Gedeon Richter. It is a potent dopamine D3 and D2 receptor partial agonist, which preferentially binds to the D3 receptor. Cariprazine also has partial agonist activity at serotonin 5-HT1A receptors. In September 2015, cariprazine received its first global approval in the USA for the treatment of schizophrenia and for the acute treatment of manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder. It is also in development in a variety of countries for the treatment of schizophrenia with predominant negative symptoms (phase III), as adjunctive therapy for major depressive disorder (phase II/III) and for the treatment of bipolar depression (phase II). This article summarizes the milestones in the development of cariprazine leading to this first approval for schizophrenia and manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder.
Whereas the treatment of MM was dependent solely on alkylating agents and corticosteroids during the prior three decades, the landscape of therapeutic measures to treat the disease began to expand enormously early in the current century. The introduction of new classes of small-molecule drugs, such as proteasome blockers (bortezomib and carfilzomib), immunomodulators (lenalidomide and pomalidomide), nuclear export inhibitors (selinexor), and histone deacetylase blockers (panobinostat), as well as the application of autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT), resulted in a seismic shift in how the disease is treated. The picture changed dramatically once again starting with the 2015 FDA approval of two monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) - the anti-CD38 daratumumab and the anti-SLAMF7 elotuzumab. Daratumumab, in particular, has had a great impact on MM therapy and today is often included in various regimens to treat the disease, both in newly diagnosed cases and in the relapse/refractory setting. Recently, other immunotherapies have been added to the arsenal of drugs available to fight this malignancy. These include isatuximab (also anti-CD38) and, in the past year, the antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) belantamab mafodotin and the chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell product idecabtagene vicleucel (ide-cel). While the accumulated benefits of these newer agents have resulted in a doubling of the disease's five-year survival rate to more than 5 years and improved quality of life, the disease remains incurable. Almost without exception patients experience relapse and/or become refractory to the drugs used, making the search for innovative therapies all the more essential. This review covers the current scope of anti-myeloma immunotherapeutic agents, both those in clinical use and on the horizon, including naked mAbs, ADCs, bi- and multi-targeted mAbs, and CAR T-cells. Emphasis is placed on the benefits of each along with the challenges that need to be overcome if MM is to be considered curable in the future.
Proteins are dominant executors of living processes. Compared to genetic variations, changes in the molecular structure and state of a protein (i.e. proteoforms) are more directly related to pathological changes in diseases. Characterizing proteoforms involves identifying and locating primary structure alterations (PSAs) in proteoforms, which is of practical importance for the advancement of the medical profession. With the development of mass spectrometry (MS) technology, the characterization of proteoforms based on top-down MS technology has become possible. This type of method is relatively new and faces many challenges. Since the proteoform identification is the most important process in characterizing proteoforms, we comprehensively review the existing proteoform identification methods in this study. Before identifying proteoforms, the spectra need to be preprocessed, and protein sequence databases can be filtered to speed up the identification. Therefore, we also summarize some popular deconvolution algorithms, various filtering algorithms for improving the proteoform identification performance and various scoring methods for localizing proteoforms. Moreover, commonly used methods were evaluated and compared in this review. We believe our review could help researchers better understand the current state of the development in this field and design new efficient algorithms for the proteoform characterization.
Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic mechanism that results in monoallelic expression of genes depending on parent-of-origin of the allele. Although the conservation of genomic imprinting among mammalian species has been widely reported for many genes, there is accumulating evidence that some genes escape this conservation. Most known imprinted genes have been identified in the mouse and human, with few imprinted genes reported in cattle. Comparative analysis of genomic imprinting across mammalian species would provide a powerful tool for elucidating the mechanisms regulating the unique expression of imprinted genes. In this study we analyzed the imprinting of 22 genes in human, mouse, and cattle and found that in only 11 was imprinting conserved across the three species. In addition, we analyzed the occurrence of the sequence elements CpG islands, C + G content, tandem repeats, and retrotransposable elements in imprinted and in nonimprinted (control) cattle genes. We found that imprinted genes have a higher G + C content and more CpG islands and tandem repeats. Short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs) were notably fewer in number in imprinted cattle genes compared to control genes, which is in agreement with previous reports for human and mouse imprinted regions. Long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs) and long terminal repeats (LTRs) were found to be significantly underrepresented in imprinted genes compared to control genes, contrary to reports on human and mouse. Of considerable significance was the finding of highly conserved tandem repeats in nine of the genes imprinted in all three species.
Pathogens are known to release in their environment a large range of toxins and other virulence factors. Their pathogenicity relies on this arsenal of exoproteins and their orchestrated release upon changing environmental conditions. Exoproteomics aims at describing and quantifying the proteins found outside of the cells, thus takes advantage of the most recent methodologies of next-generation proteomics. This approach has been applied with great success to a variety of pathogens increasing the fundamental knowledge on pathogenicity. In this chapter, we describe how the exoproteome should be prepared and handled for high-throughput identification of exoproteins and their quantitation by label-free shotgun proteomics. We also mentioned some bioinformatics tools for extracting information such as toxin similarity search.
INTRODUCTION: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a serious primary illness of the pulmonary arterioles, characterised by progressive precapillary pulmonary hypertension. The conventional therapy for this condition is so-called specific pharmacotherapy, which addresses the key mechanisms in the pathophysiology of the illness, making use of drugs from the prostanoid group, endothelin receptor antagonists and phosphodiesterase inhibitors. Treprostinil is a stable analogue of prostacyclin, which can be administered subcutaneously, intravenously or by inhalation.PATIENT SAMPLE AND METHOD: In the centre for pulmonary hypertension in the Second Internal Clinic of Cardiology and Angiology of 1st Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, and the General Teaching Hospital in Prague, 22 patients with PAH (idiopathic PAH, familial PAH, PAH associated with congenital heart disease and PAH associated with systemic connective tissue disease) were treated with trerpostinil, 18 patients with a continuous subcutaneous infusion and 4 patients with a continuous intravenous infusion. The indicators followed were the distance reached in a 6-minute walking test, functional capacity assessed by NYHA classification and mortality.RESULTS: The patients for whom treprostinil treatment was indicated had an average pressure in the right atrium of 11.9 +/- 4.2 mm Hg, average pressure in the pulmonary artery of 56.8 +/- 10.7 mm Hg, a cardiac index of 1.78 +/- 0.25 l/min/m2 and a total pulmonary resistance of 16.26 +/- 4.48 WU. 15 patients were functionally NYHA III and 7 patients were NYHA IV. The average distance achieved in a 6-minute walk test before the start of treatment was 326 +/- 83 m. When treated with gradually increasing doses of treprostinil the distance achieved in the 6-minute walk test improved. After 6 months, the group that received subcutaneous treatment had extended their distance to 359 m, after 12 months it was 393 m, after 24 months 447 m and after 36 months 494 m. After 6 months, the group that received intravenous treatment had extended their distance to 473 m, which increased to 451 m after 12 months and 489 m after 24 months. Functional capacity also improved. In total 5 patients were unable to tolerate the subcutaneous infusion, of whom 3 were placed on intravenous treprostinil and 2 on oral bosentan. 7 of the patients died in the period examined (31.8%).CONCLUSION: Treprostinil improves symptoms and hemodynamics for PAH patients and reduces mortality.
Calcium pyrophosphate deposition (CPPD) disease is an arthropathy caused by calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPP) crystal deposits in articular tissues, most commonly fibrocartilage and hyaline cartilage. According to EULAR, four different clinical presentations can be observed: 1) asymptomatic CPPD; 2) osteoarthritis (OA) with CPPD; 3) acute CPP crystal arthritis; 4) chronic CPP inflammatory crystal arthritis. Acute CPP crystal arthritis is characterized by sudden onset of pain, swelling and tenderness with overlying erythema, usually in a large joint, most often the knee, wrist, shoulder, and hip. Occasionally, ligaments, tendons, bursae, bone and the spine can be involved. CPPD of the atlanto-occipital joint (crowned dens syndrome) can cause periodic acute cervico-occipital pain with fever, neck stiffness and laboratory inflammatory syndrome. Chronic inflammatory arthritis is characterized by joint swelling, morning stiffness, pain, and high ESR and CRP. The relationship between OA and CPPD is still unclear. The main problem is whether such crystals are directly involved in the pathogenesis of OA or if they are the result of joint degeneration. Diagnosis is based on evaluation of history and clinical features, conventional radiology, and synovial fluid examination. Non-polarized light microscopy should be used initially to screen for CPPD crystals based upon their characteristic morphology, and compensated polarized light microscopy, showing the crystals to be weakly positive birefringent, is recommended for definitive identification, although this last pattern only occurs in about 20% of samples. The main goals of CPPD therapy are control of the acute or chronic inflammatory reaction and prevention of further episodes.
During clinical experience with the "atypical" neuroleptic drugs clozapine, risperidone, and zotepine, some patients have shown a marked weight gain. To prove whether weight gain is a relevant side effect of atypical neuroleptics, the charts of all patients admitted with DSM-III-R diagnoses of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or delusional disorder in the years 1991 to 1995 were evaluated. A retrospective chart review was performed, which included all patients who were treated longer than 2 weeks with a single neuroleptic. The data analysis showed that weight gain must be considered as a common side effect of atypical neuroleptics (clozapine, risperidone, sulpiride, or zotepine). The mean weight gain (3.1, 1.5, 1.9, or 4.3 kg, respectively) was significantly higher than that of patients treated with "classic" neuroleptics (mean, 0.0-0.5 kg) (Kruskal-Wallis, p = 0.01). Young and not obese patients show the highest weight increase. Because weight gain occurs in the first weeks of treatment, particularly in previously untreated subjects, this side effect has to be considered in view of compliance with long-term neuroleptic medication.
Auxin regulates various aspects of plant growth and development. The AUXIN/INDOLE-3-ACETIC ACID (Aux/IAA) genes encode short-lived transcriptional repressors that are targeted by the TRANSPORT INHIBITOR RESPONSE1/AUXIN RECEPTOR F-BOX proteins. The Aux/IAA proteins regulate auxin-mediated gene expression by interacting with members of the AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR protein family. Aux/IAA function is poorly understood; herein, we report the identification and characterization of insertion mutants in 12 of the 29 Aux/IAA family members. The mutants show no visible developmental defects compared with the wild type. Double or triple mutants of closely related Aux/IAA genes, such as iaa8-1 iaa9-1 or iaa5-1 iaa6-1 iaa19-1, also exhibit wild-type phenotypes. Global gene expression analysis reveals that the molecular phenotypes of auxin-treated and untreated light-grown seedlings are unaffected in the iaa17-6 and iaa5-1 iaa6-1 iaa19-1 mutants. By contrast, similar analysis with the gain-of-function axr3-1/iaa17-1 mutant seedlings reveals dramatic changes in basal and auxin-induced gene expression compared with the wild type. Expression of several type-A ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATOR genes and a number of genes involved in cell wall biosynthesis and degradation is repressed in axr3-1/iaa17-1. The data suggest extensive functional redundancy among Aux/IAA gene family members and that enhanced stability of the AXR3/IAA17 protein severely alters the molecular phenotype, resulting in developmental defects.
Letermovir is a human cytomegalovirus (CMV) terminase inhibitor recently approved as prophylaxis in stem cell transplant recipients. In further studies of emerging drug resistance, a baseline laboratory CMV strain was serially propagated in cell culture under a combination of letermovir and ganciclovir. In eight experiments, UL56 terminase gene mutations were detected beginning at 10 passages and included novel amino acid substitutions V236A, L328V, and A365S in a region previously associated with letermovir resistance. Outside this region, the UL56 substitution C25F was detected at moderate drug concentrations in two experiments as either the first detected mutation or an addition to a preexisting V231L substitution. In all cases, mutation at UL56 codon 325 conferring absolute letermovir resistance eventually developed at a median of 20 passages. No UL97 kinase or UL54 DNA polymerase mutations relevant to ganciclovir resistance were detected until many passages after the first detection of the UL56 mutations. UL56 substitutions V236A, L328V, and A365S were shown to confer borderline or low-grade letermovir resistance, while C25F conferred a 5.4-fold increase in letermovir resistance (50% effective concentration [EC50]) by itself and a 46-fold increase in combination with V231L. The evolution of resistance mutations sooner in UL56 than in UL54 or UL97 is consistent with prior in vitro observations, and UL56 codon 25 is a genetic locus for letermovir resistance distinct from loci previously described.
The imprinted Snurf-Snrpn chromosomal domain contains two large arrays of tandemly repeated, paternally expressed box C/D small-nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) genes: the SNORD115 (H/MBII-52) and SNORD116 (H/MBII-85) gene clusters believed to play key roles in the fine-tuning of serotonin receptor (5-HT2C) pre-mRNA processing and in the etiology of the Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS), respectively. SNORD115 and SNORD116 were recently proposed to undergo significant conversion into shorter RNA species, the so-called psnoRNAs. Here, we provide evidence that argues against the existence of abundant psnoRNAs in human or mouse brain. Instead, we characterize a previously unsuspected low-abundance, fibrillarin-associated SNORD115-derived smaller RNA species. Based on these findings, we strongly recommend that PWS-encoded SNORD115 and SNORD116 be considered as bona fide box C/D snoRNAs.
Tumor treating fields (TTFields) is a noninvasive, regional antimitotic treatment modality that has been approved for the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma by the U.S. FDA and has a CE mark in Europe. TTFields therapy delivers low-intensity (1-3 V/cm), intermediate-frequency (100-300 kHz), alternating electric fields to the tumor using transducer arrays placed on the skin around the region of the body containing the tumor. TTFields therapy affects metaphase, by disrupting mitotic spindle formation, and anaphase, by dielectrophoretic dislocation of intracellular constituents, resulting in apoptosis. TTFields therapy is frequency tuned to specific cancer cell types. The antimitotic effect of TTFields therapy has been demonstrated in multiple cell lines when the appropriate frequency was utilized. A phase III trial of TTFields monotherapy compared to active chemotherapy in recurrent glioblastoma patients established that TTFields therapy is associated with minimal toxicity, better quality of life, and comparable efficacy to chemotherapy. Ongoing and future trials will evaluate TTFields in newly diagnosed glioblastoma, solid tumor brain metastases, nonsmall cell lung cancer, and ovarian and pancreatic cancers.
Many cases of AR can be miss-diagnosed due to deficiency in the conventional laboratory tools. Detection of local Ig E immune response and allergy associated genes may aid in diagnosis of these cases. The local immune response and the allergy associated genes of these suspected cases must be evaluated as they may help in their characterization. This study was conducted on 129 patients with chronic rhinitis to determine the frequency of LAR, and analyze the association of IgE receptor (FcεR1β) gene polymorphism with LAR. All participants were subjected to clinical questionnaire, skin prick test, specific IgE measurement in serum and nasal secretions and analysis of FcεR1β gene polymorphism. LAR constituted 24.8 % of total rhinitis cases and 44.4% of non-allergic cases. Cockroach was the main sensitizing agent in local allergic rhinitis in comparison with allergic cases (OR =0.11; 95% CI= 0.04-0.34; P<0.001). In LAR, nasal specific Ig E was significantly lower than that in AR patients (P < 0.001). FcεR1β genotype TT was more frequently expressed in LAR and AR than non-allergic rhinitis (NAR) (P< 0.001). It is concluded that LAR is an emerging allergic condition that could be diagnosed by nasal specific IgE, and that FcεR1β polymorphism is one of the genetic factors associated with AR and LAR.
Synthesis of the serotype H3 (SerH3) surface antigen is temperature dependent and responds within 1 h to a change in incubation conditions (G.A. Bannon, R. Perkins-Dameron, and A. Allen-Nash, Mol. Cell. Biol. 6:3240-3245, 1986). Recently, a Tetrahymena thermophila cDNA clone (pC6; D.W. Martindale and P.J. Bruns, Mol. Cell. Biol. 3:1857-1865, 1983) has been shown to be homologous to a portion of the SerH3 mRNA (F.P. Doerder and R.L. Hallberg, personal communication), and it was shown that the cellular levels of this RNA rapidly decreased when cells were shifted from 30 to 41 degrees C (R.L. Hallberg, K.W. Kraus, and R.C. Findly, Mol. Cell. Biol. 4:2170-2179, 1984). These observations indicate that synthesis of the SerH3 protein is highly regulated in response to temperature and led us to initiate studies to determine the mechanism(s) by which SerH3 gene expression is controlled. Using pC6 as a hybridization probe for the SerH3 mRNA, we have determined that (i) the level of SerH3 protein synthesis is directly correlated with the amount of SerH3 message available for translation; (ii) there is, at most, a twofold difference between the relative transcription rates of SerH3 genes at 30 and 40 degrees C; (iii) the SerH3 mRNA half-life in cells incubated at 30 degrees C is greater than 1 h, whereas the half-life in cells incubated at 40 degrees C is only approximately 3 min. These results demonstrate that Tetrahymena SerH3 surface protein expression is regulated by mRNA abundance. Furthermore, the major mechanism controlling mRNA abundance is a dramatic temperature-dependent change in SerH3 mRNA stability.
PURPOSE: In advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), there is an unmet need for therapies that target both primary and secondary mutations of pathogenic KIT/PDGFRA oncoproteins. Ripretinib is a novel switch-control kinase inhibitor designed to inhibit a wide range of KIT and PDGFRA mutations.PATIENTS AND METHODS: This first-in-human, to our knowledge, phase I study of ripretinib (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02571036) included a dose-escalation phase and subsequent expansion phase at the recommended phase II dose (RP2D). Eligible patients included those with advanced GIST, intolerant to or experienced progression on ≥ 1 line of systemic therapy, and other advanced malignancies. Safety, dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), maximum-tolerated dose (MTD), and preliminary antitumor activity were evaluated.RESULTS: At data cutoff (August 31, 2019), 258 patients (n = 184 GIST) were enrolled, with 68 patients in the dose-escalation phase. Three DLTs were reported: grade 3 lipase increase (n = 2; 100 mg and 200 mg twice a day) and grade 4 increased creatine phosphokinase (n = 1; 150 mg once daily). MTD was not reached (maximum dose evaluated, 200 mg twice a day); 150 mg once daily was established as the RP2D. The most frequent (> 30%) treatment-emergent adverse events in patients with GIST receiving ripretinib 150 mg once daily (n = 142) were alopecia (n = 88 [62.0%]), fatigue (n = 78 [54.9%]), myalgia (n = 69 [48.6%]), nausea (n = 65 [45.8%]), palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (n = 62 [43.7%]), constipation (n = 56 [39.4%]), decreased appetite (n = 48 [33.8%]), and diarrhea (n = 47 [33.1%]). Objective response rate (confirmed) of 11.3% (n = 16/142) ranging from 7.2% (n = 6/83; fourth line or greater) to 19.4% (n = 6/31; second line) and median progression-free survival ranging from 5.5 months (fourth line or greater) to 10.7 months (second line), on the basis of investigator assessment, were observed.CONCLUSION: Ripretinib is a well-tolerated, novel inhibitor of KIT and PDGFRA mutant kinases with promising activity in patients with refractory advanced GIST.
Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUB) form a family of cysteine proteases that digests ubiquitin chains and reverses the process of protein ubiquitination. Despite the identification of a large number of DUBs, their physiological functions remain poorly defined. Here we provide genetic evidence that CYLD, a recently identified DUB, plays a crucial role in regulating the peripheral development and activation of B cells. Disruption of the CYLD gene in mice results in B cell hyperplasia and lymphoid organ enlargement. The CYLD-deficient B cells display surface markers indicative of spontaneous activation and are hyperproliferative upon in vitro stimulation. When challenged with antigens, the CYLD(-/-) mice develop exacerbated lymphoid organ abnormalities and abnormal B cell responses. Although the loss of CYLD has only a minor effect on B cell development in bone marrow, this genetic deficiency disrupts the balance of peripheral B cell populations with a significant increase in marginal zone B cells. In keeping with these functional abnormalities, the CYLD(-/-) B cells exhibit constitutive activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB due to spontaneous activation of IkappaB kinase beta and degradation of the NF-kappaB inhibitor IkappaBalpha. These findings demonstrate a critical role for CYLD in regulating the basal activity of NF-kappaB and maintaining the naive phenotype and proper activation of B cells.
Ameloblastomas are benign but locally invasive neoplasms which may grow to massive proportions and cause significant morbidity. Although some types of ameloblastoma can be treated predictably with aggressive surgical treatment, recurrent ameloblastoma and metastasising ameloblastoma are still difficult to treat. Recent studies have identified recurrent somatic and activating mutations in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and sonic hedgehog (SHH) signalling pathways in ameloblastoma. This development provided a possibility that molecular targeted therapies can be used as neoadjuvant treatment. In this review, we provide a summary of the latest WHO classification of ameloblastoma, the current understanding of genetic mutations and novel molecular targeted therapies arising from the recent developments.
BACKGROUND: Thalidomide is an anti-inflammatory and anti-angiogenic drug currently used for the treatment of several diseases, including erythema nodosum leprosum, which occurs in patients with lepromatous leprosy. In this research, we use DNA microarray analysis to identify the impact of thalidomide on gene expression responses in human cells after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. We employed a two-stage framework. Initially, we identified 1584 altered genes in response to LPS. Modulation of this set of genes was then analyzed in the LPS stimulated cells treated with thalidomide.RESULTS: We identified 64 genes with altered expression induced by thalidomide using the rank product method. In addition, the lists of up-regulated and down-regulated genes were investigated by means of bioinformatics functional analysis, which allowed for the identification of biological processes affected by thalidomide. Confirmatory analysis was done in five of the identified genes using real time PCR.CONCLUSIONS: The results showed some genes that can further our understanding of the biological mechanisms in the action of thalidomide. Of the five genes evaluated with real time PCR, three were down regulated and two were up regulated confirming the initial results of the microarray analysis.
Burning mouth syndrome is characterized by a painful burning or stinging sensation affecting the tongue or other areas of the mouth without obvious signs of an organic cause on physical examination. A burning mouth sensation can occur in several cutaneous or systemic diseases that must be ruled out prior to making a diagnosis of burning mouth syndrome, since this term is used exclusively to refer to idiopathic forms and is included within the cutaneous sensory disorders. In most cases, patients with burning mouth syndrome have accompanying psychologic or psychiatric conditions. Consequently, the syndrome has traditionally been included among the psychogenic dermatoses. However, it is currently unclear whether psychologic factors are a cause or a consequence of the syndrome, or whether each exacerbates the other. Recent studies propose the etiology to be neurologic, either neuropathic or related to taste.
PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Preexposure prophylaxis for HIV prevention is highly effective when taken as prescribed. Adherence to required dosing regimens for protection may pose challenges. Long-acting agents for HIV prevention may have the potential to improve adherence via favorable pharmacokinetics supportive of infrequent dosing. This review focuses on the potential benefits and considerations for the study and use of 2 long-acting injectable agents, cabotegravir (GSK1265744LA, CAB LA) and rilpivirine (TMC278LA, RPV LA), for use as chemoprophylaxis for HIV prevention.RECENT FINDINGS: Oral RPV is United States Food and Drug Administration approved for HIV treatment (in combination with other antiretrovirals). Both CAB LA and RPV LA are currently in phase 2a safety/tolerability/pharmacokinetic studies in anticipation and support of future efficacy evaluation. Both agents have favorable pharmacokinetics, and use is complicated by injection site reactions.SUMMARY: Long-acting injectable formulations, if safe and well tolerated, may improve pharmacokinetic coverage of exposures to HIV infection. Complexities around safety, tolerability, and starting/stopping protocols require careful consideration.
OBJECTIVE: To describe the first reported case of a patient with POEMS syndrome (polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal gammopathy, and skin changes) in conjunction with the endocrinologic manifestation of panhypopituitarism due to a large clinically nonfunctioning pituitary adenoma.METHODS: We present the clinical, laboratory, and radiologic details of the case and review the relevant updated literature.RESULTS: A 48-year-old man with hypopituitarism and progressive polyneuropathy presented to an outside hospital with confusion and diaphoresis. He also had diffuse lymphadenopathy, monoclonal gammopathy, and skin lesions consistent with a diagnosis of POEMS syndrome. Cytopathologic study of a lymph node showed findings consistent with Castleman disease. A large suprasellar mass was found to be the cause of the hypopituitarism.CONCLUSION: POEMS syndrome is a rare paraneoplastic condition, commonly associated with Castleman disease, that manifests with progressive distal polyneuropathy and a monoclonal plasma cell disorder, often accompanied by endocrinopathy, organomegaly, skin changes, sclerotic bone lesions, ascites, erythrocytosis, and thrombocytosis. Our current patient had all 5 classic features of POEMS syndrome along with some diagnostic elements of Castleman disease, sclerotic bone lesions, and thrombocytosis. To our knowledge, this is the first known reported case of a patient whose endocrinologic manifestation of POEMS syndrome was panhypopituitarism attributable to a large clinically nonfunctioning pituitary adenoma.
Here, we investigate the potential role of the PARP inhibitor rucaparib (CO-338, formerly known as AG014699 and PF-01367338) for the treatment of sporadic ovarian cancer. We studied the growth inhibitory effects of rucaparib in a panel of 39 ovarian cancer cell lines that were each characterized for mutation and methylation status of BRCA1/2, baseline gene expression signatures, copy number variations of selected genes, PTEN status, and sensitivity to platinum-based chemotherapy. To study interactions with chemotherapy, we used multiple drug effect analyses and assessed apoptosis, DNA fragmentation, and γH2AX formation. Concentration-dependent antiproliferative effects of rucaparib were seen in 26 of 39 (67%) cell lines and were not restricted to cell lines with BRCA1/2 mutations. Low expression of other genes involved in homologous repair (e.g., BCCIP, BRCC3, ATM, RAD51L1), amplification of AURKA or EMSY, and response to platinum-based chemotherapy was associated with sensitivity to rucaparib. Drug interactions with rucaparib were synergistic for topotecan, synergistic, or additive for carboplatin, doxorubicin or paclitaxel, and additive for gemcitabine. Synergy was most pronounced when rucaparib was combined with topotecan, which resulted in enhanced apoptosis, DNA fragmentation, and γH2AX formation. Importantly, rucaparib potentiated chemotherapy independent of its activity as a single agent. PARP inhibition may be a useful therapeutic strategy for a wider range of ovarian cancers bearing deficiencies in the homologous recombination pathway other than just BRCA1/2 mutations. These results support further clinical evaluation of rucaparib either as a single agent or as an adjunct to chemotherapy for the treatment of sporadic ovarian cancer.
Nup153 is a large (153 kD) O-linked glyco-protein which is a component of the basket structure located on the nucleoplasmic face of nuclear pore complexes. This protein exhibits a tripartite structure consisting of a zinc finger domain flanked by large (60-70 kD) NH2- and COOH-terminal domains. When full-length human Nup153 is expressed in BHK cells, it accumulates appropriately at the nucleoplasmic face of the nuclear envelope. Targeting information for Nup153 resides in the NH2-terminal domain since this region of the molecule can direct an ordinarily cytoplasmic protein, pyruvate kinase, to the nuclear face of the nuclear pore complex. Overexpression of Nup153 results in the dramatic accumulation of nuclear poly (A)+ RNA, suggesting an inhibition of RNA export from the nucleus. This is not due to a general decline in nucleocytoplasmic transport or to occlusion or loss of nuclear pore complexes since nuclear protein import is unaffected. While overexpression of certain Nup153 constructs was found to result in the formation of unusual intranuclear membrane arrays, this structural phenotype could not be correlated with the effects on poly (A)+ RNA distribution. The RNA trafficking defect was, however, dependent upon the Nup153 COOH-terminal domain which contains most of the XFXFG repeats. It is proposed that this region of Nup153, lying within the distal ring of the nuclear basket, represents a docking site for mRNA molecules exiting the nucleus.
Myocardial infarctions (MI) have been reported in adults with COVID-19. Although MIs are rare in children with COVID-19, cardiac involvement is still possible. In this case report, we present an adolescent with recent COVID-19 infection who presented with an ECG initially suggestive of myocardial infarction (MI). We describe how to differentiate between myocardial infarctions and myopericarditis. A 15-year-old boy, with a history of COVID-19 infection a month prior, presented to the emergency department with fever, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and chest pain. On ECG, he was found to have focal ST-segment elevations in V3 through V6. Given the immediate concern for MI, an emergent echocardiogram was done and showed normal left ventricular systolic function with no regional dyskinesia and normal coronary artery diameters. A repeat ECG showed diffuse ST elevations in the inferior leads and T-wave inversions on V5 and V6, confirming the diagnosis of myopericarditis. In conclusion, multisystem-inflammatory syndrome in children associated with COVID-19 (MIS-C) is a new entity describing a post-infectious inflammatory response in children with prior COVID-19 exposure. Cardiac involvement can include myopericarditis. Initial ECGs may show ST-changes suggestive of MI. However, serial ECGs and echocardiograms can differentiate between MI and myocarditis/myopericarditis. Even with COVID-19, MIs are extremely rare in children, and it is important to be aware of MIS-C and its cardiac complications.
Protein kinase casein kinase 1 (CK1) phosphorylates Ser-45 of beta-catenin, "priming" the subsequent phosphorylation by glycogen synthase-3 of residues 41, 37, and 33. This concerted phosphorylation of beta-catenin signals its degradation and prevents its function in triggering cell division. The sequence around Ser-45 does not conform to the canonical consensus for CK1 substrates, which prescribes either phosphoamino acids or acidic residues in position n-3 from the target serine. However, the beta-catenin sequence downstream from Ser-45 is very similar to a sequence recognized by CK1 in nuclear factor for activated T cells 4. The common features include an SLS motif followed two to five residues downstream by a cluster of acidic residues. Synthetic peptides reproducing residues 38-65 of beta-catenin were assayed with purified rat liver CK1 or recombinant CK1 alpha and CK1 alpha L from zebrafish. The results demonstrate that SLS and acidic cluster motifs are crucial for CK1 recognition. Pro-44 and Pro-52 are also important for efficient phosphorylation. Similar results were obtained with the different isoforms of CK1. Phosphorylation of mutants of full-length recombinant beta-catenin from zebrafish confirmed the importance of the SLS and acidic cluster motifs. A search for proteins with similar motifs yielded, among other proteins, adenomatous polyposis coli, previously found to be phosphorylated by CK1. There is a strong correlation of beta-catenin mutations found in thyroid tumors with the motifs recognized by CK1 in this protein.
BACKGROUND: Molluscum contagiosum (MC) is caused by a DNA virus of the poxvirus group. It is common in children, and is also found in sexually active adults and HIV-seropositive patients. Cellular immunity is essential to controlling MC virus infection. We report the first observation of a patient with stage IV Sezary syndrome, who presented multiple molluscum contagiosum, spread and surrounded by a pale halo.CASE REPORT: A woman aged 70 presented with aggravation of Sezary syndrome diagnosed in 2009 and treated with topical corticosteroids. The examination showed a generalized pruritic exanthem and multiple flesh-coloured papules from 1 to 3 mm, spread over the entire skin surface and surrounded by a white halo. Histological examination of a lesion showed the presence of infected cells with intracytoplasmic inclusions infected in an acanthotic epidermis, surrounded by a melaninopenic hypomelanosis with a normal melanocyte density. There was no inflammatory character. The diagnosis of multiple molluscum contagiosum was given, the application of clobetasol propionate was suspended and treatment with chlorambucil 4 mg/day and prednisone 0.5 mg/kg/day was started. The evolution of the rash and pruritus was rapidly favourable. After 3 months, the rash and pruritus had regressed. There was no molluscum contagiosum or clear halo.CONCLUSION: We report the original observation of a patient with stage IV Sezary syndrome, who presented multiple molluscum contagiosum, spread and surrounded by a pale halo, without inflammation, eczema or disappearance of melanocytes. This halo could be due to the secretion of a protein by molluscum contagiosum inhibiting inflammation around this MC. To our knowledge, this phenomenon reported in a patient with severe atopic dermatitis associated with Sezary syndrome has not previously been described.
BACKGROUND: Improvisation of the nanosized vesicular systems has led to a series of useful developments including the deformable vesicles namely transfersomes, ethosomes and invasomes. The former two have been explored extensively, however, literature on invasomes is relatively scanty.METHOD: Invasomal formulations researched for various applications have been reviewed using search engine "Scopus". The present review focuses on the update of the research activity on effectiveness and permeation enhancing effects of invasomes for dermal and topical delivery.RESULT: Many research reports could be found on invasomes in the literature but scarce patent citations were found. The present write up elaborates the mechanism of penetration, and compiles literature dental applications of the invasomes, the detection ability, use in photodynamic therapy, pilosebaceous targeting, and for delivery of macromolecules. The use of massage and microneedles for penetration enhancement is the newer element in this area. Interestingly, the majority of research has been reported on temoporfin molecule but scarce literature is available for other molecules, so the area provides ample research opportunities. The review also highlights toxicity fact sheet of commonly used terpenes for invasome formulation.CONCLUSION: Though invasomes present an advantageous system for enhanced topical delivery but it needs to be assessed for dermatopharmacokinetics; safety and toxicity issues on long term usage.
Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL) is triggered by constitutively activated BCR-ABL and SRC family tyrosine kinases.They account for the activations of multiple growth-signaling pathways, including Raf/MEK/ERK, Akt/mTOR and STAT5 pathways. The BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib is the standard treatment for Ph+ leukemia and plays efficacious role in CML. However, imatinib has few inhibitory effects on SRC tyrosine kinase with response rate of Ph+ ALL lower and relapse more frequent and quicker compared with CML. Previous studies showed that oridonin inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in many tumor cells. However, the anticancer activity and mechanism of oridonin in Ph+ ALL is unknown. To investigate the anticancer activity of oridonin, we examined its role in constitutively activated Akt/mTOR, Raf/MEK/ERK, STAT5 and SRC pathway, mRNA level of bcr/abl gene, cell viability and apoptosis in Ph+ ALL SUP-B15 cells. Furthermore, we detected synergetic effect of oridonin plus imatinib. Our results showed that oridonin inhibiting activations of LYN (one of SRC family kinases) and ABL and their downstream Akt/mTOR, Raf/MEK/ERK and STAT5 pathways, downregulated Bcl-2 but upregulated Bax protein and then induced apoptosis in Ph+ ALL cells. Oridonin plus imatinib exerted synergetic effects by overcoming imatinib defect of upregulating Akt/mTOR and LYN signaling. Additionally, we examined the effect of oridonin on the signaling pathways in the primary specimens from Ph+ ALL patients. Our data showed that oridonin remarkably suppressed activations of Akt/mTOR, Raf/MEK and STAT5 pathway in these primary specimens and oridonin with imatinib exerted synergetic suppressive effects on mTOR, STAT5 and LYN signaling in one imatinib resistant patient specimen. Additional evaluation of oridonin as a potential therapeutic agent for Ph+ ALL seems warranted.
One of the main features of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is benign neurofibromas, 10-20% of which become transformed into malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs). The molecular basis of NF1 tumorigenesis is, however, still unclear. Ninety-one tumors from 31 NF1 patients were screened for gross changes in the NF1 gene using microsatellite/restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers; loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was found in 17 out of 91 (19%) tumors (including two out of seven MPNSTs). Denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) was then used to screen 43 LOH-negative and 10 LOH-positive tumors for NF1 microlesions at both RNA and DNA levels. Thirteen germline and 12 somatic mutations were identified, of which three germline (IVS7-2A>G, 3731delT, 6117delG) and eight somatic (1888delG, 4374-4375delCC, R2129S, 2088delG, 2341del18, IVS27b-5C>T, 4083insT, Q519P) were novel. A mosaic mutation (R2429X) was also identified in a neurofibroma by DHPLC analysis and cloning/sequencing. The observed somatic and germline mutational spectra were similar in terms of mutation type, relative frequency of occurrence, and putative underlying mechanisms of mutagenesis. Tumors lacking mutations were screened for NF1 gene promoter hypermethylation but none were found. Microsatellite instability (MSI) analysis revealed MSI in five out of 11 MPNSTs as compared to none out of 70 neurofibromas (p=1.8 x 10(-5)). The screening of seven MPNSTs for subtle mutations in the CDKN2A and TP53 genes proved negative, although the screening of 11 MPNSTs detected LOH involving either the TP53 or the CDKN2A gene in a total of four tumors. These findings are consistent with the view that NF1 tumorigenesis is a complex multistep process involving a variety of different types of genetic defect at multiple loci.
OBJECTIVES: We sought to establish the prognostic value of a comprehensive cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) examination in risk stratification of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) patients.BACKGROUND: With annual mortality rates ranging between 1% and 5%, depending on patient selection, a small but significant number of HCM patients are at risk for an adverse event. Therefore, the identification of and prophylactic therapy (i.e., defibrillator placement) in patients with HCM who are at risk of dying are imperative.METHODS: Two-hundred forty-three consecutive patients with HCM were prospectively enrolled. All patients underwent initial CMR, and 220 were available for clinical follow-up. The mean follow-up time was 1,090 days after CMR. End points were all-cause and cardiac mortality.RESULTS: During follow-up 20 of the 220 patients died, and 2 patients survived sudden cardiac death due to adequate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator discharge. Most events (n = 16) occurred for cardiac reasons; the remaining 6 events were related to cancer and accidents. Our data indicate that the presence of scar visualized by CMR yields an odds ratio of 5.47 for all-cause mortality and of 8.01 for cardiac mortality. This might be superior to classic clinical risk factors, because in our dataset the presence of 2 risk factors yields an odds ratio of 3.86 for all-cause and of 2.20 for cardiac mortality, respectively. Multivariable analysis also revealed the presence of late gadolinium enhancement as a good independent predictor of death in HCM patients.CONCLUSIONS: Among our population of largely low or asymptomatic HCM patients, the presence of scar indicated by CMR is a good independent predictor of all-cause and cardiac mortality.
TALEN is one of the most widely used tools in the field of genome editing. It enables gene integration and gene inactivation in a highly efficient and specific fashion. Although very attractive, the apparent simplicity and high success rate of TALEN could be misleading for novices in the field of gene editing. Depending on the application, specific TALEN designs, activity assessments and screening strategies need to be adopted. Here we report different methods to efficiently perform TALEN-mediated gene integration and inactivation in different mammalian cell systems including induced pluripotent stem cells and delineate experimental examples associated with these approaches.
BACKGROUND: Mov10 is an RNA helicase that modulates access of Argonaute 2 to microRNA recognition elements in mRNAs. We examined the role of Mov10 in Xenopus laevis development and show a critical role for Mov10 in gastrulation and in the development of the central nervous system (CNS).RESULTS: Knockdown of maternal Mov10 in Xenopus embryos using a translation blocking morpholino led to defects in gastrulation and the development of notochord and paraxial mesoderm, and a failure to neurulate. RNA sequencing of the Mov10 knockdown embryos showed significant upregulation of many mRNAs when compared with controls at stage 10.5 (including those related to the cytoskeleton, adhesion, and extracellular matrix, which are involved in those morphogenetic processes). Additionally, the degradation of the miR-427 target mRNA, cyclin A1, was delayed in the Mov10 knockdowns. These defects suggest that Mov10's role in miRNA-mediated regulation of the maternal to zygotic transition could lead to pleiotropic effects that cause the gastrulation defects. Additionally, the knockdown of zygotic Mov10 showed that it was necessary for normal head, eye, and brain development in Xenopus consistent with a recent study in the mouse.CONCLUSIONS: Mov10 is essential for gastrulation and normal CNS development.

BACKGROUND: Previous studies on association of exogenous female sex hormones and risk for meningioma have yielded conflicting results. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential relation between prior use of menopausal hormone therapy or oral contraception and risk of meningioma.METHODS: This population-based case-control study was conducted during years 2000-2002 in Finland. All women aged 20-69 years with meningioma diagnosis were identified from five university hospitals, and frequency-matched controls were randomly chosen from population register. A total of 264 cases and 505 controls were interviewed on their use of menopausal hormone therapy, oral and other contraception, fertility treatment, treatment for gynecological problems, age at menarche, and number of children. We also analyzed separately tumors expressing progesterone or estrogen receptors. Of the successfully stained tumor specimens, 86.3% were positive for progesterone receptor and 50% for estrogen receptor.RESULTS: Postmenopausal hormonal treatment, use of contraceptives, or fertility treatment did not influence the risk of meningioma. In further analysis by hormone receptor status, there was some indication for an increased risk of progesterone receptor-positive meningiomas associated with oral contraceptive use (OR 1.39, 95% confidence interval 0.92-2.10) and other hormonal contraception (OR 1.50, 95% CI 0.95-2.36).CONCLUSIONS: Overall, we found little indication that reproductive factors or use of exogenous sex hormones affect meningioma risk.
The thyrotropin receptor from bovine thyroid plasma membranes has been solubilized using lithium diiodosalicylate, and an assay to measure thyrotropin binding to the solubilized receptor has been developed. Both the solubilized thyrotropin receptor and the thyrotropin receptor on thyroid plasma membranes have effectively identical nonlinear Scatchard plots and negatively sloped Hill plots, i.e. both preparations have receptors which appear to exhibit a similar negatively cooperative relationship. Although the pH optimum of thyrotropin binding to the solubilized receptor is the same as that of the thyroid plasma membrane receptor, pH 6.0, the pH dependency curve of the solubilized receptor is slightly different in its outline. Thyrotropin binding to the solubilized receptor is less sensitive to salt inhibition than is binding to the thyroid plasma membrane receptor; however, optimal binding remains at 0 degrees. The relative affinities of thyrotropin and two glycoprotein hormones which can be considered structural analogs, luteinizing hormone and human chorionic gonadotropin, are 100:10:5, respectively, toward plasma membrane receptors, but 100:25:40 toward the solubilized receptors. The solubilized receptor preparation is heterogeneous in size in that it has binding components with molecular weights of 286,000, 160,000, 75,000, and 15,000 to 30,000. Tryptic digestion converts all three higher molecular weight components to the 15,000 to 30,000 molecular weight species, and the 15,000 to 30,000 molecular weight receptor component has all of the binding properties of the solubilized receptor preparation before tryptic digestion including an identical nonlinear Scatchard plot. It has the same size as and coelutes from Sephadex G-100 with a 15,000 to 30,000 molecular weight receptor released by tryptic digestion of bovine thyroid plasma membranes or tryptic digestion of bovine or dog thyroid cells in culture. The tryptic fragment of the solubilized receptor or preparations has been purified almost 250-fold by affinity chromatography on thyrotropin-Sepharose columns. The binding activity is lost when the solubilized thyrotropin receptor preparation is exposed to beads of neuraminidase-Sepharose or conconavalin A-Sepharose.
DNA methylation, an essential regulator of transcription and chromatin structure, is established and maintained by the coordinated action of three DNA methyltransferases: DNMT1, DNMT3A and DNMT3B, and the inactive accessory factor DNMT3L. Disruptions in DNMT3B function are linked to carcinogenesis and genetic disease. DNMT3B is also highly alternatively spliced in a tissue- and disease-specific manner. The impact of intra-DNMT3 interactions and alternative splicing on the function of DNMT3 family members remains unclear. In the present work, we focused on DNMT3B. Using a panel of in vitro assays, we examined the consequences of DNMT3B splicing and mutations on its ability to bind DNA, interact with itself and other DNMT3's, and methylate DNA. Our results show that, while the C-terminal catalytic domain is critical for most DNMT3B functions, parts of the N-terminal region, including the PWWP domain, are also important. Alternative splicing and domain deletions also influence DNMT3B's cellular localization. Furthermore, our data reveal the existence of extensive DNMT3B self-interactions that differentially impact on its activity. Finally, we show that catalytically inactive isoforms of DNMT3B are capable of modulating the activity of DNMT3A-DNMT3L complexes. Our studies therefore suggest that seemingly 'inactive' DNMT3B isoforms may influence genomic methylation patterns in vivo.
AIM: To investigate the role of signal transduction and activation of transcription 4 (STAT4) in the development and progression of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).METHODS: Recent genetic investigations have identified that a genetic variant of STAT4 is associated with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related HCC. The level of STAT4 in 90 HCC patients was examined via Western blot and immunohistochemical analyses. The correlation between STAT4 expression and the clinicopathological characteristics of the patients was analyzed. The level of STAT4 expression in the HCC liver tissues was significantly lower than that in the non-HCC liver tissues and correlated with tumor size, histological grade of HCC and serum hepatitis B surface antigen level in HCC patients. The data were statistically analyzed using SPSS. Furthermore, siRNA oligos targeting STAT4 were employed to investigate the influence of STAT4 RNA interference on HCC cell physiology. Based on Cell Counting Kit-8 and flow cytometric assays, we found that depletion of STAT4 expression significantly enhanced the proliferation of L02 cells.RESULTS: STAT4 protein expression was significantly lower in HCC tissues than in normal liver tissues. Immunohistochemistry followed by statistical analysis revealed that the expression of STAT4 negatively correlated with Ki67 expression (r = 0.851; P < 0.05) and positively correlated with maximal tumor size (P < 0.05), HBV (P = 0.012) and histological grade (P < 0.05). Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed significant differences in the survival curves between HCC patients expressing low and high levels of STAT4 and Ki67 (P < 0.05). Based on a multivariate Cox proportional hazard model, STAT4 expression was an independent prognostic indicator for HCC patients who underwent curative resection. In vitro, following the release of L02 cell lines from serum starvation, the expression of STAT4 was downregulated, and transfection of L02 cells with siRNA targeting STAT4 inhibited cell proliferation.CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that STAT4 may inhibit HCC development by modulating HCC cell proliferation.
Gravitropism of oat (Avena sativa L.) and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) coleoptiles was investigated in relation to the displacement angle or to the initially set stimulation angle (SA). We measured curvature rates at the early phase of curvature, before it was affected by the drop in SA resulting from the curvature response itself. The plot of the rates against the sines of initial SAs revealed similar curves for oats and wheat, which approached saturation as the sine increased to unity. The two species and previously analyzed rice [Iino et al. (1996) Plant Cell Environ. 19: 1160] appeared to have similar gravisensitivities. Initial SAs below and over 90 degrees yielded comparable rates when the sine values were the same, indicating that the extent of gravitropism is determined by the gravity component perpendicular to the organ's long axis. Long-term curvature kinetics at different SAs indicated that the net curvature rate dropped sharply before the tip reached the vertical position and then the tip approached the vertical slowly, with clear oscillatory movements in the case of wheat. During this late curvature phase, the coleoptile straightened gradually, although none of its parts had yet reached the vertical. When rotated on horizontal clinostats or displaced upwards to reduce SA in the late curvature phase, coleoptiles bent in the opposite direction. These results demonstrated that autotropism counteracts gravitropism to straighten coleoptiles.
Hyperosmia is suspected in pregnancy; however, no empirical study using validated measures of olfactory function has clearly confirmed the anecdotal reports of this phenomenon. The goal of the current study is to compare the olfactory sensitivity of pregnant women to that of nonpregnant women and men. All participants rated their sense of smell and pregnant women listed the odors to which they were most sensitive. Detection thresholds were measured using a well-validated protocol. A group of pregnant and nonpregnant women was studied longitudinally using a signal detection procedure designed to detect small differences in sensitivity. Pregnant women, particularly in the 1st trimester, rated their sense of smell to be higher than nonpregnant women and men and indicated many (primarily unpleasant) odors to which they were more sensitive. Women rated their sense of smell higher than men. However, there was no sex difference in thresholds and neither thresholds nor signal detection measures of sensitivity were significantly affected by either sex or pregnancy status. The implications of the lack of relationship between self-report and measures of olfactory sensitivity, particularly in pregnancy, are discussed.
CSF evaluation is the single most important aspect of the laboratory diagnosis of meningitis. Analysis of the CSF abnormalities produced by bacterial, mycobacterial, and fungal infections may greatly facilitate diagnosis and direct initial therapy. Basic studies of CSF that should be performed in all patients with meningitis include measurement of pressure, cell count and white cell differential; determination of glucose and protein levels; Gram's stain; and culture. In bacterial meningitis, Limulus lysate assay and tests to identify bacterial antigens may allow rapid diagnosis. Where there is strong suspicion of tuberculous or fungal meningitis, CSF should also be submitted for acid-fast stain, India ink preparation, and cryptococcal antigen; unless contraindicated by increased intracranial pressure, large volumes (up to 40-50 mL) should be obtained for culture. If a history of residence in the Southwest is elicited, complement-fixing antibodies to Coccidioides immitis should also be ordered. Newer tests based on immunologic methods or gene amplification techniques hold great promise for diagnosis of infections caused by organisms that are difficult to culture or present in small numbers. Despite the great value of lumbar puncture in the diagnosis of meningitis, injudicious use of the procedure may result in death from brain herniation. Lumbar puncture should be avoided if focal neurologic findings suggest concomitant mass lesion, as in brain abscess, and lumbar puncture should be approached with great caution if meningitis is accompanied by evidence of significant intracranial hypertension. Institution of antibiotic therapy for suspected meningitis should not be delayed while neuroradiologic studies are obtained to exclude abscess or while measures are instituted to reduce intracranial pressure.
In virtually all eukaryotic organisms, linker DNA between nucleosomes is associated with a histone termed linker histone or histone H1. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, HHO1 encodes a putative linker histone with very significant homology to histone H1. The encoded protein is expressed in the nucleus, but has not been shown to affect global chromatin structure, nor has its deletion shown any detectable phenotype. In vitro chromatin assembly experiments with recombinant HHO1p have shown that it is able to complex with dinuncleosomes in a similar manner to histone H1. Here we report that while disruption of HHO1 has little affect on RNA levels of most cellular transcripts, there are numerous exceptions. Measurement of HHO1p concentration in the wild-type cell showed a stoichiometry of about one HHO1p molecule per 37 nucleosomes. Localization of HHO1p in the chromatin, using an immunoprecipitation technique, showed preferential HHO1p binding to rDNA sequences. These results suggest that HHO1p may play a similar role to linker histones, but at restricted locations in the chromatin.
Aurora B localization to mitotic centromeres, which is required for proper chromosome alignment during mitosis, relies on Haspin-dependent histone H3 phosphorylation and on Bub1-dependent histone H2A phosphorylation--which interacts with Borealin through a Shugoshin (Sgo) intermediate. We demonstrate that Mps1 stimulates the latter recruitment axis. Mps1 activity enhances H2A-T120ph and is critical for Sgo1 recruitment to centromeres, thereby promoting Aurora B centromere recruitment in early mitosis. Importantly, chromosome biorientation defects caused by Mps1 inhibition are improved by restoring Aurora B centromere recruitment. As Mps1 kinetochore localization reciprocally depends on Aurora B, we propose that this Aurora B-Mps1 recruitment circuitry cooperates with the Aurora B-Haspin feedback loop to ensure rapid centromere accumulation of Aurora B at the onset of mitosis.
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with increased morbidity and is in addition the most prevalent cardiac arrhythmia. Compounds used in pharmacological treatment has traditionally been divided into Na(+) channel inhibitors, β-blockers, K(+) channel inhibitors, and Ca(2+) channel inhibitors, whereas newer multichannel blockers such as amiodarone and ranolazine have been introduced later. This study was devoted to the evaluation of an acute pacing-induced in vivo model of AF in rats. Antiarrhythmic effects of well-known compounds such as lidocaine, dofetilide, and ranolazine were confirmed in this model. In addition, antiarrhythmic effects of different inhibitors of Ca(2+)-activated small conductance K(+) (SK) channels were demonstrated. Intravenous application of 5 mg/kg of the negative SK channel modulator NS8593 reduced AF duration by 64.5%, and the lowest significantly effective dose was 1.5 mg/kg. A dose-effect relationship was established based on 6 different dose groups. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the antiarrhythmic effect of NS8593 and other tested drugs was associated with an increase in atrial effective refractory period. The functional role of SK channels was confirmed by 2 other SK channel inhibitors, UCL1684 and apamin, thereby confirming the hypothesis that these channels might constitute a new promising target for antiarrhythmic treatment.
The patient aged 75 years presents since her youth, in the left eye, ocular melanosis with abnormal pigmentation of the sclerotic, hyperpigmentation of the iris and abnormal pigmentation of the fundus oculi. Six months ago, she noticed that she is not able to see with this eye, and the fundus oculi examination emphasizes a malignant choroidal melanoma, with a fixed detachment of the retina. The authors show that the denomination Bourquin's benign ocular melanosis, under which the affection is known, is improper, as 10% of the cases of ocular melanosis degenerate into melanosarcomas. The term melanosis oculi is the most adequate one.
OBJECTIVE: In patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS), recurrent epileptic activity is thought to contribute to impaired cognition (epileptic encephalopathy). Using concurrent electroencephalography-functional magnetic resonance imaging (EEG-fMRI), we recently showed that epileptiform discharges in LGS recruit large-scale networks that normally support key cognitive processes. In LGS, given that epileptic activity engages cognitive networks, and cognition is pervasively impaired, we hypothesized that cognitive network interactions in LGS are persistently abnormal.METHODS: We studied 15 LGS patients (mean age ± 1 standard deviation [SD] = 28.7 ± 10.6 years) and 17 healthy controls (mean age ± 1 SD = 27.6 ± 6.6 years) using task-free EEG-fMRI. Four networks of interest (default-mode, dorsal attention, executive control, and anterior salience) were defined using group-level independent components analysis (ICA). Functional connectivity within and between networks was determined for each subject, and then LGS network interactions were compared to network behavior in the control group. To test whether group differences were present in periods without scalp-detectable epileptiform discharges (i.e., persistent), we separately assessed discharge-affected and discharge-unaffected epochs in six patients with sufficient data for this analysis.RESULTS: In LGS, cognitive networks showed (1) reduced within-network integration, including weaker connectivity within the default-mode network, and (2) impaired between-network segregation, including stronger connectivity between the default-mode and dorsal attention networks. Abnormal interactions were present during fMRI periods with and without discharges, indicating that impaired network behavior may endure during periods without scalp-detectable epileptic activity.SIGNIFICANCE: In LGS, cognitive network interactions are persistently abnormal. Given that cognition typically worsens with the onset of LGS, and may improve after seizure control, our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the epileptic process in LGS may initiate and perhaps sustain abnormal network behavior. We propose that epileptic encephalopathy may be a consequence of persistently disrupted cognitive network interactions.
On August 30, 2017, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Novartis' tisagenlecleucel (CTL-019, Kymriah), which is a synthetic bioimmune product of anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, for the treatment of relapsed/refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). This was a milestone in tumor immunology on account of the significant antitumor effect of tisagenlecleucel for the treatment of relapsed/refractory B-ALL patients. Conventional standard therapies for B-ALL have high failure rates, thus developing new therapies is crucial for patients with B-ALL. Results from clinical trials indicate that anti-CD19 CAR T-cell therapies could successfully induce high response rates in B-ALL patients. However, related toxicities, such as cytokine release syndrome and CAR T-cell-related encephalopathy syndrome, may be severe or even fatal, and the management of such toxicities is therefore vital. This review will focus on the clinical application of anti-CD19 CAR T-cell therapy in B-ALL treatment, including design features of CAR constructs, therapeutic use of tisagenlecleucel, CAR T-cell therapy clinical trials and related toxicity, and prospects for cancer immunotherapy.

Fatal familial insomnia (FFI) is a rare hereditary human prion disease with unique clinical features including progressive sleep impairment and autonomic dysfunction. The serotonergic system is considered to be involved in the regulation of the sleep-wake cycle. In this study we demonstrate a reduced availability of serotonin transporters of 57% and 73% respectively in a thalamus-hypothalamus region of two FFI patients examined with beta-CIT SPECT as compared to age-expected control values.
Vaccines that interrupt malaria transmission are of increasing interest and a robust functional assay to measure this activity would promote their development by providing a biologically relevant means of evaluating potential vaccine candidates. Therefore, we aimed to qualify the standard membrane-feeding assay (SMFA). The assay measures the transmission-blocking activity of antibodies by feeding cultured P. falciparum gametocytes to Anopheles mosquitoes in the presence of the test antibodies and measuring subsequent mosquito infection. The International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) Harmonised Tripartite Guideline Q2(R1) details characteristics considered in assay validation. Of these characteristics, we decided to qualify the SMFA for Precision, Linearity, Range and Specificity. The transmission-blocking 4B7 monoclonal antibody was tested over 6 feeding experiments at several concentrations to determine four suitable concentrations that were tested in triplicate in the qualification experiments (3 additional feeds) to evaluate Precision, Linearity and Range. For Specificity, 4B7 was tested in the presence of normal mouse IgG. We determined intra- and inter-assay variability of % inhibition of mean oocyst intensity at each concentration of 4B7 (lower concentrations showed higher variability). We also showed that % inhibition was dependent on 4B7 concentration and the activity is specific to 4B7. Since obtaining empirical data is time-consuming, we generated a model using data from all 9 feeds and simulated the effects of different parameters on final readouts to improve the assay procedure and analytical methods for future studies. For example, we estimated the effect of number of mosquitoes dissected on variability of % inhibition, and simulated the relationship between % inhibition in oocyst intensity and % inhibition of prevalence of infected mosquitos at different mean oocysts in the control. SMFA is one of the few biological assays used in preclinical and early clinical development of transmission-blocking vaccines, and this study strongly supports its further development and application.
Thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy (TAO) is a complex disease process presumed to emerge from autoimmunity occurring in the thyroid gland, most frequently in Graves disease (GD). It is disfiguring and potentially blinding, culminating in orbital tissue remodeling and disruption of function of structures adjacent to the eye. There are currently no medical therapies proven capable of altering the clinical outcome of TAO in randomized, placebo-controlled multicenter trials. The orbital fibroblast represents the central target for immune reactivity. Recent identification of fibroblasts that putatively originate in the bone marrow as monocyte progenitors provides a plausible explanation for why antigens, the expressions of which were once considered restricted to the thyroid, are detected in the TAO orbit. These cells, known as fibrocytes, express relatively high levels of functional TSH receptor (TSHR) through which they can be activated by TSH and the GD-specific pathogenic antibodies that underpin thyroid overactivity. Fibrocytes also express insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-IR) with which TSHR forms a physical and functional signaling complex. Notably, inhibition of IGF-IR activity results in the attenuation of signaling initiated at either receptor. Some studies suggest that IGF-IR-activating antibodies are generated in GD, whereas others refute this concept. These observations served as the rationale for implementing a recently completed therapeutic trial of teprotumumab, a monoclonal inhibitory antibody targeting IGF-IR in TAO. Results of that trial in active, moderate to severe disease revealed dramatic and rapid reductions in disease activity and severity. The targeting of IGF-IR with specific biologic agents may represent a paradigm shift in the therapy of TAO.
INTRODUCTION: Soft tissue injuries are a common presenting complaint seen in the emergency department following trauma. However, internal degloving injuries are not commonly seen by the emergency provider.CASE REPORT: A 57-year-old male presented with right lower extremity pain, bruising, and swelling after a low-speed bicycle accident five days prior. Physical examination revealed an edematous and ecchymotic right lower extremity extending from the mid-thigh distally. Computed tomography of the thigh demonstrated a hyperdense foci within the fluid collection suggesting internal hemorrhage and internal de-gloving suggestive of a Morel-Lavallée lesion.DISCUSSION: The Morel-Lavallée lesion is a post-traumatic soft tissue injury that occurs as a result of shearing forces that create a potential space for the collection of blood, lymph, and fat. First described in 1853 by French physician Maurice Morel-Lavallée, this internal degloving injury can serve as a nidus of infection if not treated appropriately. Magnetic resonance imaging has become the diagnostic modality of choice due to its high resolution of soft tissue injuries. Treatment has been focused on either conservative management or surgical debridement after consultation with a surgeon.CONCLUSION: The emergency physician should consider Morel-Lavallée lesions in patients with a traumatic hematoma formation to avoid complications that come from delayed diagnosis.
Gamma-secretase catalyzes the proteolytic processing of a number of integral membrane proteins, including amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Notch. The native gamma-secretase is a heterogeneous population of large membrane protein complexes containing presenilin 1 (PS1) or presenilin 2 (PS2), aph-1a or aph-1b, nicastrin, and pen-2. Here we report the reconstitution of a gamma-secretase complex in Sf9 cells by co-infection with baculoviruses carrying the PS1, nicastrin, pen-2, and aph-1a genes. The reconstituted enzyme processes C99 and the Notch-like substrate N160 and displays the characteristic features of gamma-secretase in terms of sensitivity to a gamma-secretase inhibitor, upregulation of Abeta42 production by a familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) mutation in the APP gene, and downregulation of Notch processing by PS1 FAD mutations. However, the ratio of Abeta42:Abeta40 production by the reconstituted gamma-secretase is significantly higher than that of the native enzyme from 293 cells. Unlike in mammalian cells where PS1 FAD mutations cause an increase in Abeta42 production, PS1 FAD missense mutations in the reconstitution system alter the cleavage sites in the C99 substrate without changing the Abeta42:Abeta40 ratio. In addition, PS1DeltaE9 is a loss-of-function mutation in both C99 and N160 processing. Reconstitution of gamma-secretase provides a homogeneous system for studying the individual gamma-secretase complexes and their roles in Abeta production, Notch processing and AD pathogenesis. These studies may provide important insight into the development of a new generation of selective gamma-secretase inhibitors with an improved side effect profile.
Protein-protein interaction (PPI) extraction has been an important research topic in bio-text mining area, since the PPI information is critical for understanding biological processes. However, there are very few open systems available on the Web and most of the systems focus on keyword searching based on predefined PPIs. PIE (Protein Interaction information Extraction system) is a configurable Web service to extract PPIs from literature, including user-provided papers as well as PubMed articles. After providing abstracts or papers, the prediction results are displayed in an easily readable form with essential, yet compact features. The PIE interface supports more features such as PDF file extraction, PubMed search tool and network communication, which are useful for biologists and bio-system developers. The PIE system utilizes natural language processing techniques and machine learning methodologies to predict PPI sentences, which results in high precision performance for Web users. PIE is freely available at http://bi.snu.ac.kr/pie/.
This study explored older men's and their partners' reactions to a television news program on the medical debate surrounding the use of the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test for prostate cancer screening. Six focus groups, split by gender and socio-economic status (SES), were conducted with men aged 50 years or older (n = 28) and female partners of such men (n = 13). A self-completion questionnaire was also used to yield quantitative indices. In general, viewers appeared to appreciate from the debate that there was controversy surrounding prostate cancer screening, and they recognized that PSA testing is more applicable to certain subgroups of men. Although there were differences by SES and gender, the results suggest that exposing health consumers to medical uncertainty and "expert" conflict can help raise awareness of the issue and complexities involved. However, there was evidence to suggest that health consumers may be better able to negotiate conflicting medical information if the different sides of the argument are plainly noted and a clear distinction is made between opinion and evidence. This study has broader relevance to the management of media coverage of medical controversies by public health organizations.
Alpers disease is a recessive mitochondrial disorder caused by mutations in POLG1 and characterized primarily by progressive neurological and hepatic degeneration. Intestinal dysmotility is a frequent symptom, but it is often overshadowed by other clinical manifestations. The onset and progression of Alpers disease vary; however, most patients die during childhood, often before a specific diagnosis has been established. The gastrointestinal neuromuscular pathology of 4 patients, obtained largely from postmortem specimens, showed distinctive eosinophilic cytoplasmic granules in a subset of enteric ganglia and patchy atrophy of small intestinal muscularis externa. The cytoplasmic inclusions corresponded to abnormal mitochondria, which have been reported previously in another mitochondrial disorder (mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy) but not in Alpers disease. Recognition of these distinctive light microscopic findings, in an appropriate clinical setting, should prompt the evaluation of an underlying primary mitochondriopathy.
Recently, regenerative medicine using the transplantation of embryonic stem cells and bone marrow stem cells has been a great success but still has many unconfirmed problems including its clinical evaluation. The aim of this article is to review current literature and some patents regarding molecular therapeutic agents including using MAP kinase TNNI3K for the treatment and diagnosis of acute myocardial ischemia or infarction. TNNI3K is a novel cardiac troponin I-interacting kinase gene and its overexpression may promote cardiac myogenesis, improve cardiac performance, and attenuate ischemia-induced ventricular remodeling. The modulation of embryonal stem cells with high TNNI3K activity using a TNNI3K active peptide could be a useful therapeutic approach for ischemic cardiac diseases. For overexpressing TNNI3K or enhancing TNNI3K activity in cardiac precursor cells, the engraftment of bone marrow cells or embryonic stem cells can effectively promote cardiac myogenesis, beating frequency, and contractile functions, and decrease "silent" (no contraction) cardiac cells after cell transplantion, indicating that the overexpression of TNNI3K can increase the success rate of transplanting embryonic stem cells or bone marrow cells into ischemic hearts for the treatment of ischemic cardiac diseases. Although previous investigations showing that TNNI3K may be involved in the development of cardiac hypertrophy, it is still unclear whether TNNI3K has a role in cardiac hypertrophy or what mechanism is involved in the effects of TNNI3K. To confirm this, further investigations need to be undertaken.
Carney's Triad comprises a triad of neoplasms: gastric stromal tumor, extra-adrenal paraganglioma (usually functional), and pulmonary chondroma. At least two of these are needed for the presumptive diagnosis of the Triad. This report presents a patient who had resected a gastric tumor and nonfunctional extra-adrenal paraganglioma. The gastric tumor resembled a gastric leiomyosarcoma by light microscopy, but electron microscopy revealed it to be a gastric autonomic nerve (GAN) tumor. Based on this evidence it appears that both the gastric lesions and the paragangliomata of Carney's Triad are tumors of the autonomic nervous system. Thus, the Triad may be a disorder of the autonomic nervous system rather than a multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome or multiple hamartoma syndrome.
Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare, genetically heterogeneous disease, characterized by ciliary disfunction and impaired mucociliary clearance, resulting in a range of clinical manifestations such as chronic bronchitis, bronchiectasis, chronic rhino-sinusitis, chronic otitis media, situs viscerum inversus in almost 40-50% of cases and male infertility. The triad situs viscerum inversus, bronchiectasis and sinusitis is known as Kartagener syndrome. Up to now little is known about genetic, diagnostic and therapeutic aspects of primary motile ciliary diseases in children: for this reason, diagnosis is generally delayed and almost all treatments for PCD are not based on randomized studies but extrapolated from cystic fibrosis guidelines. The aim of this review is to propose to pediatricians a summary of current clinical and diagnostic evidence to obtain better knoledwge of this condition. The earlier diagnosis and the right treatment are both crucial to improve the prognosis of PCD.
BACKGROUND: Non-coding RNA molecules, such as microRNAs, may play an important role in carcinogenesis. Recent studies have indicated that microRNAs are involved in initiation and progression of various malignancies. However, little work has been done to compare the microRNA expression patterns in oral cancer. In this study, we constructed an animal model of oral squamous cell carcinoma to investigate expression profiles of microRNAs in oral carcinogenesis.METHODS: The animal model of oral squamous cell carcinoma was conducted by tri-weekly (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday) painting with 5% DMBA in acetone. Six Syrian hamsters, including three from the treated group and three from the control group, were used as a training group for microRNA microarray analysis. All microarray data were analyzed by Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) and CLUSTER 3.0 software, and this result was further confirmed by qRT-PCR assay.RESULTS: Seventeen microRNAs were differentially expressed in oral squamous cell carcinoma. Five microRNAs (hsa-miR-21, hsa-miR-200b, hsa-miR-221, hsa-miR-338, and mmu-miR-762) were significantly upregulated and twelve microRNAs (hsa-miR-16, hsa-miR-26a, hsa-miR-29a, hsa-miR-124a, hsa-miR-125b, mmu-miR-126-5p, hsa-miR-143, hsa-miR-145, hsa-miR-148b, hsa-miR-155, hsa-miR-199a, and hsa-miR-203) were down-regulated in cancer tissues. The expression levels of hsa-miR-21 and hsa-miR-16 seen with Stem-loop qRT-PCR were also seen in microarray analysis in all samples.CONCLUSION: Our findings identified specific microRNA expression in oral squamous cell carcinoma and suggested that microRNAs have a role in oral carcinogenesis.
The effects of training are dependent on complex, adaptive changes which are induced by acute physical exercise at different levels. In particular, evidence shows that the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenocortical axis, as well as the sympatho-adrenomedullary system, is mainly involved in mediating the physiological effects of physical exercise. The aim of the present study was to investigate, through a morphological and biochemical approach, the effects of training on the adrenal gland of mice, following two different protocols consisting of either low- or high-intensity training. Mice were run daily on a motorised treadmill for 8 weeks, at a velocity corresponding to 60% (low-intensity exercise) or 90% (high-intensity exercise) of the maximal running velocity previously determined by an incremental exercise test. We found that physical exercise produced an increase in the adrenal gland size compared with the control (sedentary) mice. The increase was 31.04% for mice that underwent high-intensity exercise and 10.08% for mice that underwent low intensity exercise, and this appeared to be the result of an increase in the area of both the adrenal cortex and adrenal medulla. Morphological analysis of the adrenal cortex showed that both types of exercise produced an increase in cytoplasmic vacuoles in steroidogenic cells, appearing more abundant after high-intensity exercise. No change was found in the reticulate zone. In the adrenal medulla, despite the absence of morphological changes, immunohistochemistry for tyrosine hydroxylase, dopamine β-hydroxylase and phenyl-ethanolamine-N-methyltransferase demonstrated an increased immunopositivity for these cathecolamine-synthesizing enzymes after intense exercise. These results were confirmed by immunoblot accompanied by densitometric analysis.
A combination of T4 polynucleotide kinase, Escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase, yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae capping enzyme consisting of alpha (RNA guanylyltransferase) and beta (RNA 5'-triphosphatase) subunits. and its alpha subunit without RNA 5'-phosphatase activity was used to establish a simple enzymatic method for determination of RNA species with 5'-hydroxyl, 5'-monophosphate, 5'-diphosphate or 5'-triphosphate termini. Using this method, we found that viral genome RNA (vRNA) segments of both A-type and C-type influenza viruses carry tri- or diphosphates at their 5' termini. The conclusion was based on the observations that: (i) 5' phosphorylation of vRNAs by T4 polynucleotide kinase takes place only after phosphatase treatment; and (ii) capping of vRNAs can be observed with both the intact yeast capping enzyme and its alpha subunit alone devoid of RNA 5'-triphosphatase activity; but (iii) the level of capping is higher for the alphabeta holoenzyme than the alpha subunit though the relative level varies depending on RNA preparations. The results support the de novo initiation for the RNA replication although transcription of influenza vRNAs is initiated by host cell capped RNAs as primers.
Achalasia is a motility disorder of the esophagus characterized by total loss of esophageal peristalsis and by defective lower esophageal sphincter function. The etiology of achalasia is poorly understood. Achalasia occurs across the lifespan, but is uncommon in children. Most patients have progressive dysphagia for both liquids and solids. This article describes the symptoms of achalasia, its diagnosis, and treatment. The emphasis is on primary achalasia. Case studies illustrate common findings in patients with achalasia. The importance of patient education for effective management of this chronic illness is discussed.
BACKGROUND: Computed tomography (CT), a strong diagnostic tool, delivers higher radiation doses than most imaging modalities. As CT use has increased rapidly, radiation protection is important, particularly among children. We evaluate leukemia and brain tumor risk following exposure to low-dose ionizing radiation from CT scans in childhood.METHODS: For a nationwide retrospective cohort of 168 394 children who received one or more CT scans in a Dutch hospital between 1979 and 2012 who were younger than age 18 years, we obtained cancer incidence, vital status, and confounder information by record linkage with external registries. Standardized incidence ratios were calculated using cancer incidence rates from the general Dutch population. Excess relative risks (ERRs) per 100 mGy organ dose were calculated with Poisson regression. All statistical tests were two-sided.RESULTS: Standardized incidence ratios were elevated for all cancer sites. Mean cumulative bone marrow doses were 9.5 mGy at the end of follow-up, and leukemia risk (excluding myelodysplastic syndrome) was not associated with cumulative bone marrow dose (44 cases). Cumulative brain dose was on average 38.5 mGy and was statistically significantly associated with risk for malignant and nonmalignant brain tumors combined (ERR/100 mGy: 0.86, 95% confidence interval = 0.20 to 2.22, P = .002, 84 cases). Excluding tuberous sclerosis complex patients did not substantially change the risk.CONCLUSIONS: We found evidence that CT-related radiation exposure increases brain tumor risk. No association was observed for leukemia. Compared with the general population, incidence of brain tumors was higher in the cohort of children with CT scans, requiring cautious interpretation of the findings.
Prior genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of major depressive disorder (MDD) have met with limited success. We sought to increase statistical power to detect disease loci by conducting a GWAS mega-analysis for MDD. In the MDD discovery phase, we analyzed more than 1.2 million autosomal and X chromosome single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 18 759 independent and unrelated subjects of recent European ancestry (9240 MDD cases and 9519 controls). In the MDD replication phase, we evaluated 554 SNPs in independent samples (6783 MDD cases and 50 695 controls). We also conducted a cross-disorder meta-analysis using 819 autosomal SNPs with P<0.0001 for either MDD or the Psychiatric GWAS Consortium bipolar disorder (BIP) mega-analysis (9238 MDD cases/8039 controls and 6998 BIP cases/7775 controls). No SNPs achieved genome-wide significance in the MDD discovery phase, the MDD replication phase or in pre-planned secondary analyses (by sex, recurrent MDD, recurrent early-onset MDD, age of onset, pre-pubertal onset MDD or typical-like MDD from a latent class analyses of the MDD criteria). In the MDD-bipolar cross-disorder analysis, 15 SNPs exceeded genome-wide significance (P<5 × 10(-8)), and all were in a 248 kb interval of high LD on 3p21.1 (chr3:52 425 083-53 822 102, minimum P=5.9 × 10(-9) at rs2535629). Although this is the largest genome-wide analysis of MDD yet conducted, its high prevalence means that the sample is still underpowered to detect genetic effects typical for complex traits. Therefore, we were unable to identify robust and replicable findings. We discuss what this means for genetic research for MDD. The 3p21.1 MDD-BIP finding should be interpreted with caution as the most significant SNP did not replicate in MDD samples, and genotyping in independent samples will be needed to resolve its status.
The t(14,18) chromosomal translocation that occurs in human follicular lymphoma constitutively activates the BCL2 gene and disrupts control of apoptosis. Interestingly, 70% of the t(14,18) translocations are confined to three 15-bp clusters positioned within a 150-bp region (major breakpoint region or [MBR]) in the untranslated portion of terminal exon 3. We analyzed DNA-protein interactions in the MBR, as these may play some role in targeting the translocation to this region. An 87-bp segment (87MBR) immediately 3' to breakpoint cluster 3 was essential for DNA-protein interaction monitored with mobility shift assays. We further delineated a core binding region within 87MBR: a 33-bp, very AT-rich sequence highly conserved between the human and mouse BCL2 gene (37MBR). We have purified and identified one of the core factors as the matrix attachment region (MAR) binding protein, SATB1, which is known to bind to AT-rich sequences with a high propensity to unwind. Additional factors in nuclear extracts, which we have not yet characterized further, increased SATB1 affinity for the 37MBR target four- to fivefold. Specific binding activity within 37MBR displayed cell cycle regulation in Jurkat T cells, while levels of SATB1 remained constant throughout the cell cycle. Finally, we demonstrated in vivo binding of SATB1 to the MBR, strongly suggesting the BCL2 major breakpoint region is a MAR. We discuss the potential consequences of our observations for both MBR fragility and regulatory function.
Ascorbic acid is a vitamin soluble in water and its deficiency in human body causes scurvy. Its symptoms in adults are gingivitis, susceptibility of blood vessels to damage and bleeding, changes in bones and cartilage and retarded wound healing. Ascorbic acid is necessary in redox processes taking place in cell. It is reversibly oxidized to dehydroascorbic acid and partially metabolized to inactive sulphide and oxalic acid, which is expelled in urine. It is well absorbed from the digestive system and easily reaches the tissues. Healthy organism contains 1.5 g of ascorbic acid and daily requirement for ascorbic acid is estimated for 30-100 mg. Ascorbic acid is not synthesized by humans, but it is an essential dietary vitamin for the species. Ascorbic acid is used in treatment deficiency in daily demand for vitamin C, caused by improper diet, poor absorption or cigarette smoking. It is used in large doses in general weakness, infectious diseases and during the recovery period. Positive results have been obtained after therapy with vitamin C of Mollera-Barlowa disease, Schonlein-Henoch disease, Werlhof disease, haemophilia and also in patients with stable coronary artery disease. Vitamin C is assumed to be a basic antioxidant, although its role in pathological conditions is controversial. However, it seems that the complexity of the oxidant-antioxidant system makes the question of participation of vitamin C (and other scavengers of free radicals) in pathogenesis of diseases still open.
p19(ARF) plays an essential role in the senescence of mouse cells, and its expression is lost by methylation or deletion of the ARF locus; otherwise, p53 is inactivated to bypass senescence. ARF expression is tightly regulated, but little is known about its posttranscriptional regulation. Here, we show that an RNA-binding protein, HuR (human antigen R), represses ARF mRNA translation, thereby maintaining the replicative life span of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Loss of HuR results in premature senescence, with concomitant increases in p19(ARF) but not p16(Ink4a) levels, and this senescence is not observed in ARF-null MEFs that retain an intact Ink4a locus. HuR depletion does not alter ARF transcription or stability but enhances ribosome association with ARF mRNA. Under these conditions, ARF mRNA accumulates in nucleoli, where it associates with nucleolin. Furthermore, adipose-specific deletion of the HuR gene results in increased p19(ARF) expression in aged animals, which is accompanied by decreased insulin sensitivity. Together, our findings demonstrate that p19(ARF) is also regulated at the translational level, and this translational regulation restrains the cellular life span and tissue functions in vivo.
Recent studies have identified genes involved in high-altitude adaptation in Tibetans. Genetic variants/haplotypes within regions containing three of these genes (EPAS1, EGLN1, and PPARA) are associated with relatively decreased hemoglobin levels observed in Tibetans at high altitude, providing corroborative evidence for genetic adaptation to this extreme environment. The mechanisms that afford adaptation to high-altitude hypoxia, however, remain unclear. Considering the strong metabolic demands imposed by hypoxia, we hypothesized that a shift in fuel preference to glucose oxidation and glycolysis at the expense of fatty acid oxidation would improve adaptation to decreased oxygen availability. Correlations between serum free fatty acid and lactate concentrations in Tibetan groups living at high altitude and putatively selected haplotypes provide insight into this hypothesis. An EPAS1 haplotype that exhibits a signal of positive selection is significantly associated with increased lactate concentration, the product of anaerobic glycolysis. Furthermore, the putatively advantageous PPARA haplotype is correlated with serum free fatty acid concentrations, suggesting a possible decrease in the activity of fatty acid oxidation. Although further studies are required to assess the molecular mechanisms underlying these patterns, these associations suggest that genetic adaptation to high altitude involves alteration in energy utilization pathways.
In this two-phase crossover study, 39 hypercholesterolemic subjects followed a prudent diet with either lean red meat or fish and skinless chicken (treatment groups), and 13 subjects (reference group) followed their habitual diet. Fasting blood samples were analyzed for plasma total cholesterol, triacylglycerol (TAG), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low density lipoprotein one- and two-cholesterol, apolipoprotein-B, very low density lipoprotein cholesterol, and very low density lipoprotein TAG, and fatty acid composition of plasma TAG and cholesteryl ester (CE). Body mass and blood pressure were determined. Seven-day dietary records were kept once at baseline and twice during the treatment periods. Significant differences were observed in dietary intake between the baseline and treatment diets and between the two treatment diets. HDL-C (P < 0.05) and diastolic blood pressure (P < 0.01) were higher in patients on the red meat diet than in those on the chicken-fish diet. No other significant differences in lipoproteins were observed between the effects of the two treatment diets. The linoleic acid (%), eicosapentaenoic acid (%), and the eicosapentaenoic acid/arachidonic acid ratios in TAG and CE were higher (P < 0.01) in subjects on the chicken-fish diet than in those on the red meat diet. In conclusion, this study showed that the effect of two lipid-lowering diets containing either lean red meat or skinless chicken and fish on the atherogenic lipoproteins did not differ significantly. A prudent diet with skinless chicken and fish, however, had a more favorable effect on the fatty acid composition of the plasma TAG and the CE than did the lean red meat diet.
BACKGROUND: Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays coupled to genome arrays (Chip-on-chip) or massive parallel sequencing (ChIP-seq) lead to the genome wide identification of binding sites of chromatin associated proteins. However, the highly variable quality of antibodies and the availability of epitopes in crosslinked chromatin can compromise genomic ChIP outcomes. Epitope tags have often been used as more reliable alternatives. In addition, we have employed protein in vivo biotinylation tagging as a very high affinity alternative to antibodies. In this paper we describe the optimization of biotinylation tagging for ChIP and its coupling to a known epitope tag in providing a reliable and efficient alternative to antibodies.RESULTS: Using the biotin tagged erythroid transcription factor GATA-1 as example, we describe several optimization steps for the application of the high affinity biotin streptavidin system in ChIP. We find that the omission of SDS during sonication, the use of fish skin gelatin as blocking agent and choice of streptavidin beads can lead to significantly improved ChIP enrichments and lower background compared to antibodies. We also show that the V5 epitope tag performs equally well under the conditions worked out for streptavidin ChIP and that it may suffer less from the effects of formaldehyde crosslinking.CONCLUSION: The combined use of the very high affinity biotin tag with the less sensitive to crosslinking V5 tag provides for a flexible ChIP platform with potential implications in ChIP sequencing outcomes.
BACKGROUND: Ichthyosis follicularis, atrichia, and photophobia (IFAP) syndrome is a rare congenital disorder. Missense mutations in the membrane-bound transcription factor protease, site 2 (MBTPS2) gene have recently been identified in patients with IFAP.OBJECTIVE: To determine whether Chinese patients with IFAP have MBTPS2 mutations.METHODS: We observed a large IFAP pedigree of 5 generations in a Chinese family and performed MBTPS2 molecular analysis.RESULTS: The male proband was severely affected. He presented with hyperextensibility of the interphalangeal joints of the fingers in addition to previously reported clinical manifestations. Clinically affected female patients had hairless patches on the scalp, ichthyosiform skin changes, hypotrichosis, hyperkeratosis, nail dystrophy, and brown scaly plaques, some of which were arranged in a linear pattern following the lines of Blaschko. Molecular analysis identified a novel missense mutation in exon 11 and confirmed cosegregation of the missense mutation with the disease in this family.LIMITATIONS: It is unclear whether hyperextensibility of the fingers was nosologically related to IFAP syndrome or was a coincidental finding.CONCLUSION: This report provides further evidence for the genetic basis of IFAP syndrome and enlarges the phenotypic spectrum and number of MBTPS2 mutations. We confirm that MBTPS2 mutations cause IFAP in patients of Chinese origin.
A counting process senses the X chromosome/autosome ratio and ensures that X chromosome inactivation (XCI) initiates in the early female (XX) embryo and in differentiating female ES cells but not in their male (XY) counterparts. Counting depends on the X inactivation center (Xic), which contains the Xist gene encoding a nuclear RNA, which coats the inactive X chromosome and induces gene silencing. A 37-kb sequence lying 3' to the Xist gene is known to prevent initiation of XCI in male differentiating ES cells. This region contains the major and minor promoters of the Tsix gene, which runs antisense to Xist, and the DXPas34 tandem repeat lying close to the Tsix major promoter. We have addressed the role of these elements in counting by using male ES cells. Targeted deletion of DXPas34 impaired recruitment of RNA-polymerase II and TFIIB at the Tsix major promoter, resulting in low levels of Tsix expression in ES cells and moderate ectopic initiation of XCI upon differentiation. A deletion extending 3' to Xist and including the Tsix major promoter resulted in almost complete impairment of Tsix transcription and in efficient ectopic XCI upon differentiation of male ES cells. Internal deletions within the Tsix gene did not affect significantly the level of antisense transcription within Xist and had only minor effects upon differentiation. Our results identify a function for DXPas34 in murine XCI and demonstrate the critical role of Tsix transcription in preventing XCI in differentiating male ES cells and in normal functioning of the counting pathway.
HINTERGRUND: Ziel dieser Arbeit war die Evaluierung der 70-Gen-Prognose-Signatur MammaprintTM bei Patientinnen ≥ 60 Jahre mit einem invasiven Mammakarzinom.PATIENTEN UND METHODEN: 60 Patientinnen wurden für diese prospektive Studie rekrutiert. Einschlusskriterien waren: pT1c-3, pN0–1a, Grading 2/3, Hormonrezeptor-Positivität und HER2-negativer Tumor. Das klinische Risikoprofil wurde mit dem Programm Adjuvant! Online (AOL) eingeschätzt.ERGEBNISSE: 38 Frauen (63%) wurden durch die 70-Gen-Signatur als Niedrigrisiko-Patienten eingestuft; demgegenüber stehen 22 (37%) in der Hochrisiko-Gruppe. Beim Vergleich zwischen den Niedrigund Hochrisiko-Gruppen wurde kein statistisch signifikanter Unterschied für die konventionellen Prognoseparameter gefunden, insbesondere nicht für Ki-67. In der AOL-Analyse wurden 33 Patientinnen (55%) als Hochrisiko-Patienten eingestuft, von denen 20 ein diskordantes 70-Gen-Signaturergebnis hatten. Eine Diskordanz zwischen der 70-Gen-Signatur und dem AOL-Ergebnis wurde bei 48% der Patientinnen ermittelt. Diese Rate liegt höher als in früheren Publikationen. Die Kombination von klinisch-pathologischer Risikoeinstufung und Gensignatur führte bei 11 Patientinnen (18%) zu einer Änderung der adjuvanten systemischen Therapieempfehlung.SCHLUSSFOLGERUNGEN: Die 70-Gen-Signatur könnte bei älteren Frauen mit einem mittleren Risiko ein Zusatzkriterium für bzw. gegen eine adjuvante Chemotherapieempfehlung sein. Die konventionellen klinischpathologischen Parameter korrelierten nicht mit der 70-Gen-Signatur für diese Patientinnen.
Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome is a rare condition, classically associated with a triad of facial and/or lip edema, fissured tongue, and relapsing facial palsy. This article offers a review of the literature and presents two cases of Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome associated with elevated serum levels of angiotensin converting enzyme in two patients of Thai descent.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a recently described member of the renin-angiotensin system that hydrolyzes angiotensin (Ang) II to Ang-(1-7), and may thereby protect against cardiovascular and renal diseases. ACE2 is a type 1 integral membrane protein and contains a catalytically active ectodomain that can be shed from the cell surface into the extracellular space, via cleavage by a disintegrin and metalloproteinase-17 (ADAM-17). ACE2 enzymatic activity and protein can be detected in biological fluids, including urine, plasma, and conditioned cell culture media. We present a detailed method for measurement of ACE2 activity in biological fluids, using hydrolysis of an intramolecularly quenched fluorogenic ACE2 substrate, in the absence or presence of the ACE2 inhibitors MLN-4760 or DX600. Recombinant human or mouse ACE2 is used to generate standard curves for this assay, with ACE2 detection ranging from 1.56 to 50 ng/ml. While MLN-4760 potently inhibits the activity of both human and mouse ACE2, DX600 (linear form) only effectively blocks human ACE2 activity in this assay. In biological samples of human and mouse urine, cell culture medium from mouse proximal tubular cells, and mouse plasma, the mean intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation (CVs) of the assay range from 1.43 to 4.39 %, and from 7.01 to 13.17 %, respectively. We present data on the time and substrate concentration dependence of the assay, and show that exogenous D -glucose, creatinine, urea, and albumin do not interfere with its performance. In biological fluids, this assay is a simple and reliable method to study the role of ACE2 and its shed fragments in cardiovascular and renal diseases.
Hansen's disease is a chronic granulomatous disease of infectious origin. It has a worldwide distribution and a variety of clinical manifestations often involving the skin, nasal mucosa, and peripheral nerves. Lepromatous leprosy characterizes the condition of a large group of patients with little or no resistence to the infection. Several forms of lepromatous leprosy are recognized, including macular, nodular, and diffuse. Lucio's phenomenon is a rare but distinctive skin eruption seen in patients with diffuse lepromatous leprosy. The diffuse lesions of Lucio's phenomenon have a predilection for the extremities, can include nodules, and heal with atrophic stellate scars; histologically, a necrotizing vasculitis accompanied by a nonspecific inflammatory reaction may be seen. We describe two patients with Lucio's phenomenon who presented with nontender, painless, skin lesions with nodules in part perceptible only by palpation. Both patients were treated with multidrug therapy, and immunosuppressive doses of steroids as the suggested optimal treatment for this reactional state. However, Lucio's phenomenon is frequently fatal as a result of bacterial infection or sepsis, and both patients reported here died. We call attention to this particular and unusual skin manifestation of lepromatous leprosy, which can mimic rheumatic disease and other causes of vasculitis. This is especially likely to be unrecognized in nonendemic countries but cases will occasionally be seen in this age of extensive international travel.
PURPOSE: Ferroptosis is a new mode of regulated cell death, which is completely distinct from other cell death modes based on morphological, biochemical, and genetic criteria. This study evaluated the therapeutic role of ferroptosis in classic chemotherapy drugs, including the underlying mechanism.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cell viabilitywas detected by using the methylthiazoltetrazlium dye uptake method. RNAiwas used to knockout iron-responsive element binding protein 2, and polymerase chain reaction, western blot was used to evaluate the efficiency. Intracellular reduced glutathione level and glutathione peroxidases activitywere determined by related assay kit. Intracellularreactive oxygen species levelswere determined by flowcytometry. Electron microscopywas used to observe ultrastructure changes in cell.RESULTS: Among five chemotherapeutic drugs screened in this study, cisplatin was found to be an inducer for both ferroptosis and apoptosis in A549 and HCT116 cells. The depletion of reduced glutathione caused by cisplatin and the inactivation of glutathione peroxidase played the vital role in the underlying mechanism. Besides, combination therapy of cisplatin and erastin showed significant synergistic effect on their anti-tumor activity.CONCLUSION: Ferroptosis had great potential to become a new approach in anti-tumor therapies and make up for some classic drugs, which open up a new way for their utility in clinic.
Mitochondria originated by permanent enslavement of purple non-sulphur bacteria. These endosymbionts became organelles through the origin of complex protein-import machinery and insertion into their inner membranes of protein carriers for extracting energy for the host. A chicken-and-egg problem exists: selective advantages for evolving import machinery were absent until inner membrane carriers were present, but this very machinery is now required for carrier insertion. I argue here that this problem was probably circumvented by conversion of the symbiont protein-export machinery into protein-import machinery, in three phases. I suggest that the first carrier entered the periplasmic space via pre-existing beta-barrel proteins in the bacterial outer membrane that later became Tom40, and inserted into the inner membrane probably helped by a pre-existing inner membrane protein, thereby immediately providing the protoeukaryote host with photosynthesate. This would have created a powerful selective advantage for evolving more efficient carrier import by inserting Tom70 receptors. Massive gene transfer to the nucleus inevitably occurred by mutation pressure. Finally, pressure from harmful, non-selected gene transfer to the nucleus probably caused evolution of the presequence mechanism, and photosynthesis was lost.
Septins are a family of conserved proteins that are essential for cytokinesis in a wide range of organisms including fungi, Drosophila and mammals. In budding yeast, where they were first discovered, they are thought to form a filamentous ring at the bridge between the mother and bud cells. What regulates the assembly and function of septins, however, has remained obscure. All septins share a highly conserved domain related to those found in small GTPases, and septins have been shown to bind and hydrolyze GTP, although the properties of this domain and the relationship between polymerization and GTP binding/hydrolysis is unclear. Here we show that human septin 2 is phosphorylated in vivo at Ser218 by casein kinase II. In addition, we show that recombinant septin 2 binds guanine nucleotides with a Kd of 0.28 microm for GTPgammaS and 1.75 microm for GDP. It has a slow exchange rate of 7 x 10(-5) s(-1) for GTPgammaS and 5 x 10(-4) s(-1) for GDP, and an apparent kcat value of 2.7 x 10(-4) s(-1), similar to those of the Ras superfamily of GTPases. Interestingly, the nucleotide binding affinity appears to be altered by phosphorylation at Ser218. Finally, we show that a single septin protein can form homotypic filaments in vitro, whether bound to GDP or GTP.
The proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, registered for Multiple Myeloma treatment, is currently explored for activity in solid tumors including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Here we studied the proteasome-based mechanisms underlying intrinsic and acquired bortezomib resistance in NSCLC cells. Various NSCLC cell lines displayed differential intrinsic sensitivities to bortezomib. High basal chymotrypsin- and caspase-like proteasome activities correlated with bortezomib resistance in these cells. Next, via stepwise selection, acquired bortezomib resistant cells were obtained with 8-70-fold increased resistance. Cross-resistance was found to proteasome inhibitors specifically targeting β-subunits, but not to the novel α-subunit-specific proteasome inhibitor (5AHQ). Consistently, bortezomib-resistant cells required higher bortezomib concentrations to induce G2/M arrest and apoptosis. Interestingly, bortezomib concentration-dependent caspase cleavage, Mcl-1 and NOXA accumulation remained intact in resistant H460 and SW1573 cells, while A549 resistant cells displayed different expression profiles suggesting additional and more protein specific adaptations. Furthermore, bortezomib-resistant cells exhibited increased levels of both constitutive and immuno-β-subunits. Sequence analysis of the bortezomib-binding pocket in the β5-subunit revealed Ala49Thr, Met45Val and Cys52Phe substitutions that were not previously described in solid tumors. Bortezomib-resistant cells displayed reduced catalytic proteasome activities and required higher bortezomib concentrations to achieve comparable inhibition of proteasome activity. Taken together, these findings establish that high basal levels of proteasome activity correlate with intrinsic bortezomib resistance. Furthermore, acquired bortezomib resistance in NSCLC is associated with proteasome subunit overexpression and emergence of mutant β5-subunits that likely compromise bortezomib binding. α-Subunit-specific proteasome inhibitors, however, can efficiently bypass this resistance modality.
BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The 9-item Wearing-off Questionnaire (WOQ-9) is a useful tool for screening of wearing-off. We performed a validation study of the Japanese version of the WOQ-9 (JWOQ-9) using a cross-sectional design in Japanese Parkinson's disease (PD) patients diagnosed with sporadic PD and treated with levodopa.METHODS: Subjects with severe dementia, uncontrolled psychiatric comorbidities, and previous PD neurosurgery were excluded. The wearing-off phenomenon was detected according to the JWOQ-9, and the results were compared with independent evaluations of wearing-off conducted by PD specialists blinded to the JWOQ-9 results. To validate the JWOQ-9, a sample size of at least 70 patients with wearing-off and 70 patients without wearing-off was required. Therefore, a total of 180 patients (101 patients with wearing-off and 79 patients without wearing-off) were enrolled.RESULTS: The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the JWOQ-9 were 94.1%, 39.2%, 66.4%, and 83.8%, respectively. Motor symptom questions demonstrated both moderate sensitivity (58.1-87.3%) and specificity (60.4-87.5%). In contrast, non-motor symptom questions demonstrated fair to moderate sensitivity (51.5-64.6%), with high specificity (80.0-94.1%). Like the original WOQ-9, the JWOQ-9 exhibits significant value for detecting possible wearing-off.CONCLUSIONS: The JWOQ-9 is a useful screening tool for detecting wearing-off of both motor and non-motor symptoms.
Human kallikrein-related peptidase 3 (hK3), also known as prostate-specific antigen (PSA), is a 33 kDa single chain glycoprotein belonging to the kallikrein family of serine proteases. With chymotrypsin-like enzymatic activity, hK3 is directly and indirectly involved in a number of diverse biological functions including male fertility, the regulation of cell proliferation, and the inhibition of angiogenesis. The gene encoding hK3, hKLK3, is located on chromosome 19 and its expression has been shown to be regulated by steroid hormones through androgen receptor-mediated transcription. hK3 was once thought to be exclusively expressed and secreted by prostatic epithelial cells, hence the initial name of prostate-specific antigen, but has since been isolated in several nonprostatic tissues and ongoing characterization of alternative splicing variants has found at least 13 distinct mRNA transcripts. The detection of hK3 in cerebrospinal fluid prompted the hypothesis that hK3 may be produced in the brain. To test this notion, in this study we used RT-PCR amplification of brain tissue total RNA and examined hK3 protein by immunohistochemical, and immunoblot analysis. RT-PCR revealed several hK3 mRNA transcripts in the brain. Confirming these findings, both immunohistochemical staining and western immunoblotting showed evidence for hK3 protein in neuronal cells. Taken together, our findings support the expression of hK3 in neuronal cells reinforcing the concept of hK3 as a ubiquitous protein with more multifarious biological activity than previously believed. Ongoing research seeks to elucidate the functional significance of hK3 in brain cells.
Type II topoisomerases are essential for resolving topologically entwined double-stranded DNA. Although anti-topoisomerase 2 (Top2) drugs are clinically important antibiotics and chemotherapies, to our knowledge, the mechanisms of cell killing by Top2 depletion and inactivation have never been directly compared. We show that depletion of Top2 protein from budding yeast cells prevents DNA decatenation during S phase. Cells complete DNA replication and enter the ensuing mitosis on schedule, suffering extensive chromosome missegregation. Cytokinesis through incompletely segregated chromosomes causes lethal DNA damage. By contrast, expression of catalytically inactive Top2 causes a stable G2 arrest requiring an intact DNA damage checkpoint. Checkpoint activation correlates with an inability to complete DNA replication, resulting in hypercatenated, gapped daughter DNA molecules. Thus, Top2 depletion and inactivation kill cells by different mechanisms, which has implications for understanding the nature of the catenation checkpoint, how DNA replication terminates, how anti-Top2 drugs work, and how new drugs might be designed.
Cancer cells do not exist as pure homogeneous populations in vivo. Instead they are embedded in "cancer cell nests" that are surrounded by stromal cells, especially cancer associated fibroblasts. Thus, it is not unreasonable to suspect that stromal fibroblasts could influence the metabolism of adjacent cancer cells, and visa versa. In accordance with this idea, we have recently proposed that the Warburg effect in cancer cells may be due to culturing cancer cells by themselves, out of their normal stromal context or tumor microenvironment. In fact, when cancer cells are co-cultured with fibroblasts, then cancer cells increase their mitochondrial mass, while fibroblasts lose their mitochondria. An in depth analysis of this phenomenon reveals that aggressive cancer cells are "parasites" that use oxidative stress as a "weapon" to extract nutrients from surrounding stromal cells. Oxidative stress in fibroblasts induces the autophagic destruction of mitochondria, by mitophagy. Then, stromal cells are forced to undergo aerobic glycolysis, and produce energy-rich nutrients (such as lactate and ketones) to "feed" cancer cells. This mechanism would allow cancer cells to seed anywhere, without blood vessels as a food source, as they could simply induce oxidative stress wherever they go, explaining how cancer cells survive during metastasis. We suggest that stromal catabolism, via autophagy and mitophagy, fuels the anabolic growth of tumor cells, promoting tumor progression and metastasis. We have previously termed this new paradigm "The Autophagic Tumor Stroma Model of Cancer Metabolism", or the "Reverse Warburg Effect". We also discuss how glutamine addiction (glutaminolysis) in cancer cells fits well with this new model, by promoting oxidative mitochondrial metabolism in aggressive cancer cells.
The genetic pathways underlying shoulder blade development are largely unknown, as gene networks controlling limb morphogenesis have limited influence on scapula formation. Analysis of mouse mutants for Pbx and Emx2 genes has suggested their potential roles in girdle development. In this study, by generating compound mutant mice, we examined the genetic control of scapula development by Pbx genes and their functional relationship with Emx2. Analyses of Pbx and Pbx1;Emx2 compound mutants revealed that Pbx genes share overlapping functions in shoulder development and that Pbx1 genetically interacts with Emx2 in this process. Here, we provide a biochemical basis for Pbx1;Emx2 genetic interaction by showing that Pbx1 and Emx2 can bind specific DNA sequences as heterodimers. Moreover, the expression of genes crucial for scapula development is altered in these mutants, indicating that Pbx genes act upstream of essential pathways for scapula formation. In particular, expression of Alx1, an effector of scapula blade patterning, is absent in all compound mutants. We demonstrate that Pbx1 and Emx2 bind in vivo to a conserved sequence upstream of Alx1 and cooperatively activate its transcription via this potential regulatory element. Our results establish an essential role for Pbx1 in genetic interactions with its family members and with Emx2 and delineate novel regulatory networks in shoulder girdle development.
A 2-substituted purine nucleotide analog, 2-hydroxy-2'-deoxyadenosine 5'-triphosphate (2-OH-dATP), was added to a PCR mixture, to examine its mutagenic potential. The 2-OH-dATP enhanced the total mutation frequency. Interestingly, 2-OH-dATP induced both transition and transversion mutations, including A:T-->G:C, A:T-->C:G and G:C-->T:A mutations. In contrast, other 2-substituted purine nucleotide analogs, 2-aminopurine-2'-deoxyriboside 5'-triphosphate and 2-amino-2'-deoxyadenosine 5'-triphosphate, did not affect the total mutation frequency. These results suggest that 2-OH-dATP is useful in random PCR mutagenesis for the in vitro evolution of nucleic acids and proteins, and for analyses of residues in these biomolecules.
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible brain disorder associated with severe progressive dementia and is characterized by deposits of amyloid plaques in the brain. Over the past 20 years, the mortality of strokes and heart disease has decreased, but deaths from AD have increased. The four drugs used clinically to treat AD can only relieve symptoms but cannot slow the progression of the disease. Aducanumab, a human monoclonal antibody that preferentially binds to aggregated amyloid-β to reduce the number of amyloid plaques and slow disease progression, was approved to treat AD by the US Food and Drug Administration on June 7, 2021. It is the first disease-modifying therapy for AD, but there is considerable controversy regarding the drug's approval. Aducanumab offers hope for millions of patients.
Production of high-quality, well-characterized recombinant proteins facilitates screening of compound libraries. The protocols detailed in this unit are used to purify three recombinant enzymes that are widely used in HCV research: the HCV NS3 protease domain, the helicase domain as an NS3+NS4A complex, and the NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The active enzymes are purified to homogeneity by two-column chromatography to support a screening program for HCV inhibitors.
Syndecans are transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycans involved in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation, adhesion, neuronal development, and lipid metabolism. Syndecans are expressed in a tissue-specific manner to facilitate diverse cellular processes. As receptors and co-receptors, syndecans provide promising therapeutic targets that bind to a variety of physiologically important ligands. Negatively charged glycosaminoglycan chains of syndecans, located in the extracellular compartment, are critical for such binding. Functions of syndecans are as diverse as their ligands. For example, hepatic syndecan-1 mediates clearance of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. Syndecan-2 promotes localization of Alzheimer's amyloid Aβ peptide to the cell surface, which is proposed to contribute to amyloid plaque formation. Syndecan-3 helps co-localize the appetite-regulating melanocortin-4 receptor with its agonist, leading to an increased appetite. Finally, syndecan-4 initiates the capture of modified low-density lipoproteins by macrophages and thereby promotes the atheroma formation. We hypothesize that syndecan modifications such as desulfation of glycosaminoglycan chains may contribute to a wide range of diseases, from atherosclerosis to type 2 diabetes. At the same time, desulfated syndecans may have beneficial effects, as they can inhibit amyloid plaque formation or decrease the appetite. Despite considerable progress in understanding diverse functions of syndecans, the complex physiological roles of this intriguing family of proteoglycans are far from clear. Additional studies of syndecans may potentially help develop novel therapeutic approaches and diagnostic tools to alleviate complex human diseases such as cardiovascular and Alzheimer's diseases.
Population bottlenecks can have major effects in the evolution of RNA viruses, but their possible influence in the evolution of DNA viruses is largely unknown. Genetic and biological variation of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) has been studied by subjecting 23 biological clones of the virus to 10 plaque-to-plaque transfers. In contrast to large population passages, plaque transfers led to a decrease in replicative capacity of HSV-1. Two out of a total of 23 clones did not survive to the last transfer in 143 TK(-) cells. DNA from three genomic regions (DNA polymerase, glycoprotein gD and thymidine kinase) from the initial and passaged clones was sequenced. Nucleotide substitutions were detected in the TK and gD genes, but not in the DNA polymerase gene. Assuming a uniform distribution of mutations along the genome, the average rate of fixation of mutations was about five mutations per viral genome and plaque transfer. This value is comparable to the range of values calculated for RNA viruses. Four plaque-transferred populations lost neurovirulence for mice, as compared with the corresponding initial clones. LD(50) values obtained with the populations subjected to serial bottlenecks were 4- to 67-fold higher than for their parental clones. These results equate HSV-1 with RNA viruses regarding fitness decrease as a result of plaque-to-plaque transfers, and show that population bottlenecks can modify the pathogenic potential of HSV-1. Implications for the evolution of complex DNA viruses are discussed.
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to assess the asymptomatic Clostridium difficile carriage rates following fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT).METHODS: All patients who underwent FMT for recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) via colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy between June 2013 and April 2015 and had a minimum of 8-week follow-up post FMT at two tertiary care referral centres were included in the study. Patients were prospectively followed both clinically and with stool assessments for 8 weeks post FMT. Assessments occurred at 1 week and 4 weeks post FMT to assess for failure. Failure was defined as presence of diarrhoeal symptoms and a positive CDI stool test by polymerase chain reaction for toxin gene (PCR) at any time point during the 8-week follow-up period. CDI stool testing using PCR was performed at weeks 1 and 4 post FMT in asymptomatic patients as well.RESULTS: 167 patients were included. Twenty-eight patients (16.7% (28/167)) were FMT failures throughout the 8-week period. At week 1, seven patients had already failed the FMT. Of the remaining 160 patients, 144 were asymptomatic, and among these, 141 were negative for C. difficile toxin gene by PCR. This resulted in an asymptomatic carriage rate of 2.1% (3/144). At week 4, 143 patients had not yet failed FMT. Of these patients 129 patients were asymptomatic and among those, 125 were negative by PCR, resulting in an asymptomatic carriage rate of 3% (3/129).CONCLUSIONS: Asymptomatic carriage after FMT is rare. This suggests that testing for cure after FMT in asymptomatic patients is not necessary.
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Amifostine is an inorganic thiophosphate cytoprotective agent known chemically as ethanethiol, 2-&#91;(3-aminopropyl)amino&#93;dihydrogen phosphate. It is a pro-drug of free thiol that may act as a scavenger of free radicals generated in tissues exposed to cytotoxic drugs, and binds to reactive metabolites of such drugs. Amifostine was originally developed as a radioprotective agent in a classified nuclear warfare project. Following declassification of the project it was evaluated as a cytoprotective agent against toxicity of the alkylating drugs and cisplatin. In fact, pretreatment with amifostine was well tolerated and reduced the cumulative hematologic, renal and neurological toxicity associated with cisplatin, cyclophosphamide and vinblastine therapy of advanced and metastatic solid tumors. The objective of this review is to focus the importance of amifostine as a myeloprotective and cytoprotective drug during treatment with chemotherapeutics, presenting the most recent results, and to discuss the application of amifostine in the therapy of myelodysplastic syndromes.EVIDENCE AND INFORMATION SOURCES: The material analyzed in this study includes data published or under publication by the authors as full papers or clinical protocols. Articles and abstracts published in Journals covered by Medline constitute the other source of information.STATE OF THE ART AND PERSPECTIVES: Amifostine, formerly known as WR-2721, is an organic thiophosphate that was developed to protect normal tissues selectively against the toxicities of chemotherapy and radiation. Amifostine is a pro-drug that is dephosphorylated at the tissue site to its active metabolite by alkaline phosphatase. Differences in the alkaline phosphatase concentrations of normal versus tumor tissues can result in greater conversion of amifostine in normal tissues. Once inside the cell the free thiol provides an alternative target to DNA and RNA for the reactive molecules of alkylating or platinum agents and acts as a potent scavenger of the oxygen free radicals induced by ionizing radiation and some chemotherapies. Preclinical animal studies demonstrated that the administration of amifostine protected against a variety of chemotherapy-related toxicities including cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity, cisplatin-induced neurotoxicity, cyclophosphamide- and bleomycin-induced pulmonary toxicity, and the cytotoxicities (including cardiotoxicity) induced by doxorubicin and related chemotherapeutic agents. Amifostine was shown to protect a variety of animal species from lethal doses of radiation. Studies in tumor-bearing animals demonstrated that the administration of amifostine results in cytoprotection without loss of antitumor activity. Multiple phase I studies were carried out with amifostine in combination with chemotherapy for various neoplasms. Appropriate doses of amifostine resulted to be 740-910 mg/m(2) in a single dose regimen, and 340 mg/m(2) in a multiple dose regimen. Amifostine afforded not only hematologic protection, but also other organ protection from cytotoxic agents such as nephrotoxicity, mucositis and peripheral neuropathy from cisplatin. Many studies have been performed to investigate cytoprotective efficacy of amifostine. In brief, amifostine gives hematologic protection from cyclophosphamide, carboplatin, mitomycin C, fotemustine and radiotherapy; renal and peripheral nerve protection from cisplatin; mucosa, skin, and salivary gland from radiotherapy. In phase I/II studies these properties have been confirmed, together with a generally good tolerability of the drug, hypotension being the most common side effect. It has been observed that amifostine possibly enhances the anti-tumor effect of carboplatin, nitrogen mustard, melphalan, and cisplatin combined with 5-FU or vinblastine. For all these characteristics, amifostine is at present broadly used as supportive treatment during chemotherapy, in lymphomas and solid tumors, and its spec
BACKGROUND: The co-translational incorporation of selenocysteine into nascent polypeptides by recoding the UGA stop codon occurs in all domains of life. In eukaryotes, this event requires at least three specific factors: SECIS binding protein 2 (SBP2), a specific translation elongation factor (eEFSec), selenocysteinyl tRNA, and a cis-acting selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS) element in selenoprotein mRNAs. While the phylogenetic relationships of selenoprotein families and the evolution of selenocysteine usage are well documented, the evolutionary history of SECIS binding proteins has not been explored.RESULTS: In this report we present a phylogeny of the eukaryotic SECIS binding protein family which includes SBP2 and a related protein we herein term SBP2L. Here we show that SBP2L is an SBP2 paralogue in vertebrates and is the only form of SECIS binding protein in invertebrate deuterostomes, suggesting a key role in Sec incorporation in these organisms, but an SBP2/SBP2L fusion protein is unable to support Sec incorporation in vitro. An in-depth phylogenetic analysis of the conserved L7Ae RNA binding domain suggests an ancestral relationship with ribosomal protein L30. In addition, we describe the emergence of a motif upstream of the SBP2 RNA binding domain that shares significant similarity with a motif within the pseudouridine synthase Cbf5.CONCLUSION: Our analysis suggests that SECIS binding proteins arose once in evolution but diverged significantly in multiple lineages. In addition, likely due to a gene duplication event in the early vertebrate lineage, SBP2 and SBP2L are paralogous in vertebrates.
Preclinical work has led to an increased understanding of the immunomodulatory mechanisms involved in the regulation of the antitumor response in a variety of tumor types. PD-1 (programmed death 1) appears to be a key checkpoint involved in immune suppression in the tumor microenvironment, even in diseases not previously thought to be sensitive to immune manipulation. More recently, the subsequent clinical development of PD-1-based therapy has resulted in a major breakthrough in the field of oncology. Pembrolizumab, a humanized highly selective IgG4 anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody, was recently approved for the treatment of advanced melanoma based on promising early-phase clinical data. Encouraging results have also been seen in other malignancies, and PD-1-targeted therapies are likely to markedly change the treatment landscape. Future work will center on rationally designed combination strategies in order to potentiate the antitumor immune response and overcome mechanisms of resistance.
BACKGROUND: Glutathione transferases (GST) detoxify environmental and endogenous compounds and levels of two polymorphic GST proteins, GSTM3 and GSTP1, are high in the brain. Previous studies of GSTM3 and GSTP1 polymorphisms and adult brain tumor risk have produced inconsistent results, whereas the GSTM3 -63 variant is newly identified and, therefore, has not yet been studied in this context. We therefore examined associations between GSTM3 -63, GSTM3 *A/*B, GSTP1 105, and GSTP1 114 variants and adult brain tumor risk and the interaction of the effects of these same polymorphisms with cigarette smoking. In addition, the enzymes NQO1 and CYP1A1 alter susceptibility to oxidative brain damage. Because there is less previous evidence for a role of NQO1, CYP1A1, GSTM1, and GSTT1 variants, we restricted analysis of these variants to a small preliminary study.METHODS: We genotyped DNA collected for an international population-based case-control study of 725 glioma cases, 329 of which were glioblastoma cases, 546 meningioma cases and 1,612 controls. Study participants were residents of Sweden, southeast England, Denmark, and Finland.RESULTS: We found no associations between the GSTM3, GSTP1, NQO1, CYP1A1, GSTM1, or GSTT1 polymorphisms and adult brain tumor risk with the possible exception of a weak association between the G-C (Val-Ala) GSTP1 105/114 haplotype and glioma [odds ratio (OR), 0.73; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.54, 0.99], nor was there an interaction between the effects of the GSTM3 or GSTP1 polymorphisms and cigarette smoking.CONCLUSIONS: Overall, we observed no strong evidence for an association between GST or related enzyme polymorphisms and adult brain tumor risk.
Corneal diseases exhibit a high prevalence and are prone to cause blindness; furthermore, maintaining the morphology and ionic transporter expression in corneal endothelial cells (CECs) is crucial for treatment of these diseases. This study aimed to investigate the effects of the novel Rho associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase (ROCK) inhibitor, thiazovivin (2,4‑disubstituted thiazole, TZV), on human corneal endothelial‑to‑mesenchymal transition/epithelial‑to‑mesenchymal transition (EndMT/EMT), cell morphology, junction proteins and ionic transporter expression in human CECs (HCECs) in vitro and then to clarify the mechanisms of action of TZV. In the present study, primary HCECs were cultured in vitro and passaged. The expression levels of adhesion proteins (E‑cadherin and N‑cadherin), the EndMT/EMT marker, α smooth muscle  actin (α‑SMA), the tight junction protein, Zonula occludens-1 (ZO‑1), and the ionic transporter, Na+/K+‑ATPase, were detected by immunofluorescence. The proliferative ability of the HCECs was determined by CCK-8 assay. The mRNA expression of the EndMT/EMT‑inducing gene, Snail, was examined by RT‑PCR. The protein expression levels of ROCK1/2 were evaluated by western blot analysis. The HCECs were cultured with TZV at various concentrations (2, 4, or 6 µM) for different periods of time (24 or 48 h). We found that the the cell states of the HCECs co‑cultured with 4 µM TZV for 48 h reached the optimum, and corneal EndMT/EMT was inhibited, as evidenced by the significantly upregulated expression of ZO‑1 and E‑cadherin, and the markedly downregulated expression of N‑cadherin and α‑SMA. Furthermore, the cells exhibited a normal, tightly connected hexagonal or pentagonal morphology. Additionally, the protein expression of ROCK1/2 and the mRNA expression of Snail were significantly decreased. However, there was no significant difference between the TZV‑treated and the control groups as regards HCEC proliferative ability. These findings suggested that the ROCK inhibitor, TZV (4 µM), was effective in improving the morphology, cell junctions and ionic transporter expression of HCECs by inhibiting EndMT/EMT, but had no effect on HCEC proliferation.
GRN, the gene coding for the progranulin (PGRN) protein, was recognized as a gene linked to frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). The first mutations identified were null mutations giving rise to haploinsufficiency. Missense mutations were subsequently detected, but only a small subset has been functionally investigated. We identified missense mutations (C105Y, A199V, and R298H) in FTLD cases with family history and/or with low plasma PGRN levels. The aim of this study was to determine their pathogenicity. We performed functional studies, analyzing PGRN expression, secretion, and cleavage by elastase. GRN C105Y affected both secretion and elastase cleavage, likely representing a pathogenic mutation. GRN A199V did not alter the physiological properties of PGRN and GRN R298H produced only moderate effects on PGRN secretion, indicating that their pathogenicity is uncertain. In the absence of strong segregation data and neuropathological examinations, genetic, biomarker, and functional studies can be applied to an algorithm to assess the likelihood of pathogenicity for a mutation. This information can improve our understanding of the complex mechanisms by which GRN mutations lead to FTLD.
The structure of several lysosomal membrane glycoproteins (lamp1, lamp2, limpI and limpII) has been described. The significance of the receptor glycoprotein lamp2a in the chaperone-mediated autophagy of cytosolic proteins with KFERQ motif has been described in details as well as the chaperone protein Hsc73 and other chaperones involved in this process. Several modulatory mechanisms of the chaperone-mediated autophagy, which is activated in condition of stress and starvation, were also outlined.
5-Azacytidine inhibits DNA synthesis and to a lesser proportion RNA synthesis in S. antibioticus. The biosynthesis of proteins is not affected. The main inhibitory effect of 5-azacytidine on DNA and RNA synthesis is probably caused by its incorporation into newly synthesized DNA or RNA and the formation of covalent complexes between cytosine-specific methyltransferases and the modified DNA or RNA templates. To analyze whether such effects could occur at the oriC region of S. antibioticus we analyzed the methylation status of this region using the bisulphite assisted genomic sequencing method. One of the cytosine residues found to be partially methylated was contained within an unique NaeI sequence (GCCGGC) in oriC. Subsequent analysis shows chromosomal DNA from S. antibioticus to be resistant to R.NaeI restriction indicating that this strain contains a NaeI-specific cytosine C5-methyltransferase activity. Following 5-azacytidine treatment the NaeI site within the oriC region becomes partially demethylated. Our results suggest that some of the 5-azacytidine effects on DNA and RNA synthesis might indeed be related to the complex formation and inhibition of a cytosine-specific DNA methyltransferase.
Despite the common practice of upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, the unique phenomenon of punctate black pigmentation of the duodenal mucosa, now known as pseudomelanosis duodeni, still remains a rare entity. Four patients with normal renal function at presentation were found to have this pigment on endoscopy. One developed renal failure subsequently but the pigmentation persisted and this observation has not been reported before. Histochemical and ultrastructural studies were made. It is postulated that the pigment is heterogenous and represents a form of stored iron. Anti-hypertensive drugs may have a role in the causation of the pigmentation formation.
Atg4 is required for cleaving Atg8, allowing it to be conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine on phagophore membranes, a key step in autophagosome biogenesis. Deconjugation of Atg8 from autophagosomal membranes could be also a regulatory step in controlling autophagy. Therefore, the activity of Atg4 is important for autophagy and could be a target for therapeutic intervention. In this study, a sensitive and specific method to measure the activity of two Atg4 homologs in mammalian cells, Atg4A and Atg4B, was developed using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based approach. Thus LC3B and GATE-16, two substrates that could be differentially cleaved by Atg4A and Atg4B, were fused with CFP and YFP at the N- and C-terminus, respectively, allowing FRET to occur. The FRET signals decreased in proportion to the Atg4-mediated cleavage, which separated the two fluorescent proteins. This method is highly efficient for measuring the enzymatic activity and kinetics of Atg4A and Atg4B under in vitro conditions. Applications of the assay indicated that the activity of Atg4B was dependent on its catalytic cysteine and expression level, but showed little changes under several common autophagy conditions. In addition, the assays displayed excellent performance in high throughput format and are suitable for screening and analysis of potential modulators. In summary, the FRET-based assay is simple and easy to use, is sensitive and specific, and is suitable for both routine measurement of Atg4 activity and high-throughput screening.

BACKGROUND: The Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale is a universally applied instrument for the quantitative assessment of dystonia in both children and adults. However, immature movements by healthy young children may also show "dystonic characteristics" as a consequence of physiologically incomplete brain maturation. This could implicate that Burke-Fahn-Marsden scale scores are confounded by pediatric age.OBJECTIVE: In healthy young children, we aimed to determine whether physiologically immature movements and postures can induce an age-related effect on Burke-Fahn-Marsden movement and disability scale scores.METHODS: Nine assessors specializied in movement disorders (3 adult neurologists, 3 pediatric neurologists, and 3 MD/PhD students) independently scored the Burke-Fahn-Marsden movement scale in 52 healthy children (4-16 years of age; 2 boys and 2 girls per year of age). Independent of that, parents scored their children's functional motor development according to the Burke-Fahn-Marsden disability scale in another 52 healthy children (4-16 years of age; 2 boys and 2 girls per year of age). By regression analysis, we determined the association between Burke-Fahn-Marsden movement and disability scales outcomes and pediatric age.RESULTS: In healthy children, assessment of physiologically immature motor performances by the Burke-Fahn-Marsden movement and disability scales showed an association between the outcomes of both scales and age (until 16 years and 12 years of age, β = -0.72 and β = -0.60, for Burke-Fahn-Marsden movement and disability scale, respectively [both P < 0.001]).CONCLUSIONS: The Burke-Fahn-Marsden movement and disability scales are influenced by the age of the child. For accurate interpretation of longitudinal Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale scores in young dystonic children, consideration of pediatric age-relatedness appears advisory.
Parkinson's disease psychosis (PDP) is a common and often very disturbing component of Parkinson's disease (PD). PDP consists of hallucinations that are mainly visual and delusions that are often of a paranoid nature. These symptoms can be the most troubling and disruptive of all the manifestations of Parkinson's disease. Current treatment methods include the reduction of anti-Parkinson's medications, a strategy that may worsen the motor problems the medications are prescribed to alleviate, and the introduction of selected antipsychotic medications that carry with them the potential for troubling side effects and serious consequences. Pimavanserin has been developed and studied in clinical trials to specifically address Parkinson's disease psychosis and has been submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for its approval for this purpose. If this is granted, we believe the evidence of Pimavanserin efficacy, safety and tolerability will position this medication as the first choice for treatment of Parkinson's disease psychosis.
OBJECTIVE: There are number of studies which report that BCL-2 anti-apoptotic proteins (e.g. BCL-2, BCL-XL, and MCL-1) are highly expressed in cervical cancer tissues compared to the normal cervical epithelia. Despite these reports, targeting these proteins for cervical cancer treatment has not been explored extensively. BH3-mimetics that inhibit specific BCL-2 anti-apoptotic proteins may hold encouraging treatment outcomes for cervical cancer management. Hence, the aim of this pilot study is to investigate the sensitivity of cervical cancer cell lines to combination of two BH3-mimetics namely ABT-263 which selectively inhibits BCL-2, BCL-XL and BCL-w and A-1210477, a selective MCL-1 inhibitor.RESULTS: We report that combination of A-1210477 and ABT-263 exhibited synergistic effects on all cervical cancer cell lines tested. Drug sensitization studies revealed that A-1210477 sensitised the cervical cancer cell lines SiHa and CaSki to ABT-263 by 11- and fivefold, respectively. Sensitization also occurred in the opposite direction whereby ABT-263 sensitised SiHa and CaSki to A-1210477 by eightfold. This report shows that combination of ABT-263 and A-1210477 could be a potential treatment strategy for cervical cancer. Extensive drug mechanistic studies and drug sensitivity studies in physiological models are necessary to unleash the prospect of this combination for cervical cancer therapy.
Considering the high mortality rates and the unfavorable prognosis of gastric cancer (GC) as well as the lack of a clinical predictive marker, which is sufficiently sensitive to GC, it is of great significance to investigate new sensitive and specific markers for GC diagnosis. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) could be a practical form of potential biomarkers in the diagnosis of human disease, and they are confirmed to be closely associated with GC. In this review, we discuss the recent research results that indicate the feasibility and clinical applications of miRNAs in GC. Although several challenges remain to be addressed, miRNAs have the potential to be applied in the diagnosis of GC.
On the basis of sequence homology a model is proposed for five structural and functional domains in viroids. These domains include (i) a conserved central region capable of forming two alternative structures that may regulate two phases of the viroid replication cycle, (ii) a region associated with pathogenicity, (iii) a domain with high sequence variability, (iv and v) two terminal domains that are interchangeable between viroids. That the evolution of viroids has involved RNA rearrangements of domains is supported by the partial duplication of coconut cadang cadang viroid, which arises de novo during each infection. Similar RNA rearrangements have been established for animal viral defective interfering RNAs, which arise by some form of discontinuous transcription. This mechanism could account for the origin of viroids and also RNA viruses, whereby modules of genetic information may have undergone repeated exchange between RNA pathogens and the RNA of their hosts.
Metformin appears to be involved in altering energy expenditure and thermogenesis, and could affect hypothalamic feeding circuits. However, it is not clear whether metformin is able to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) to reach the hypothalamus and exert a direct effect on the central nervous system. Here we show the presence of metformin in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of diabetic rats administered orally with metformin which was confirmed by detecting the concentration of metformin with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Food intake of diabetic rats treated with metformin was reduced, and glucose homeostasis was gained. Expression of orexigenic peptides neuropeptide Y (NPY) and agouti-related protein (AgRP) decreased in the hypothalamus of metformin-treated diabetic rats, though anorexigenic peptides pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) did not change significantly. The phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) was increased but phosphorylated AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) was similar in the hypothalamus of metformin-treated diabetic rats. Our findings suggest that metformin may cross BBB and play a central mechanism on regulation of food intake in the hypothalamus. The anorexic effect of metformin may be mediated by inhibition of NPY and AgRP gene expression through the STAT3 signaling pathway.
OBJECTIVE: To describe the efficacy and safety of vortioxetine for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD).DATA SOURCES: The pivotal registration trials were accessed by querying http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/, http://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu and http://www.clinicaltrials.gov for the search terms 'vortioxetine' and 'Lu AA21004', and by obtaining posters presented at congresses. Product labelling provided additional information.STUDY SELECTION: All available clinical reports of studies were identified.DATA EXTRACTION: Descriptions of the principal results and calculation of number needed to treat (NNT) and number needed to harm (NNH) for relevant dichotomous outcomes were extracted from the available study reports and other sources of information.DATA SYNTHESIS: Vortioxetine is a multi-modal antidepressant that functions as a human 5-HT3A and 5-HT7 receptor antagonist, 5-HT1B receptor partial agonist, 5-HT1A receptor agonist, and inhibitor of the serotonin transporter. The recommended dose range is 5-20 mg/day. Approval for the treatment of MDD was based on a clinical development programme that included six positive 6-8 week studies, including one study in elderly people, and one positive maintenance study in adults. In the informative short-term studies in non-elderly patients, NNT for response with vortioxetine vs. placebo was 7 (95% CI 6-9), and NNT for remission vs. placebo was 11 (95% CI 8-17). NNH for discontinuation because of an adverse event (AE) was 36 (95% CI 24-70). The most commonly encountered AEs (incidence ≥ 5% and at least twice the rate of placebo) as identified in product labelling were nausea, constipation and vomiting, with NNH values vs. placebo of 6 (95% CI 6-7), 64 (95% CI 37-240), and 28 (95% CI 23-38), respectively. Changes in weight were not clinically relevant.CONCLUSIONS: Vortioxetine represents another option for the treatment of MDD. Vortioxetine appears to have a favourable weight-gain profile. Additional information regarding the time course of response/remission and for the commonly occurring AE of nausea would be helpful to better characterise this agent. Pending clinical trials include those examining cognitive dysfunction that can accompany MDD.
Mismatch uracil DNA glycosylase (Mug) from Escherichia coli is an initiating enzyme in the base-excision repair pathway. As with other DNA glycosylases, the abasic product is potentially more harmful than the initial lesion. Since Mug is known to bind its product tightly, inhibiting enzyme turnover, understanding how Mug binds DNA is of significance when considering how Mug interacts with downstream enzymes in the base-excision repair pathway. We have demonstrated differential binding modes of Mug between its substrate and abasic DNA product using both band shift and fluorescence anisotropy assays. Mug binds its product cooperatively, and a stoichiometric analysis of DNA binding, catalytic activity and salt-dependence indicates that dimer formation is of functional significance in both catalytic activity and product binding. This is the first report of cooperativity in the uracil DNA glycosylase superfamily of enzymes, and forms the basis of product inhibition in Mug. It therefore provides a new perspective on abasic site protection and the findings are discussed in the context of downstream lesion processing and enzyme communication in the base excision repair pathway.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of directional current steering and short pulse stimulation in the ventral intermediate thalamic nucleus (VIM) on stimulation-induced side effects in patients with essential tremor.METHODS: We recruited 8 patients with essential tremor in a stable postoperative condition (>3 months after electrode implantation of deep brain stimulation [DBS] electrodes) with segmented contacts implanted in the VIM. Tremor severity on acute stimulation was assessed by the Fahn-Tolosa-Marin Tremor Rating Scale. Cerebellar impairment was evaluated with the International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale. Patients rated paresthesia intensity with a visual analog scale.RESULTS: In all patients, tremor was reduced to the same extent by VIM stimulation regardless of pulse width using energy dose-equivalent amplitudes. Short pulse stimulation diminished stimulation-induced ataxia of the upper extremities and paresthesia compared with conventional parameters. Directional steering with monopolar stimulation of single segments successfully suppressed tremor but also induced ataxia. No differences in adverse effects were found between single-segment stimulation conditions.CONCLUSION: These proof-of-principle findings provide evidence that acute short pulse stimulation is superior to directional steering in the subthalamic area to decrease stimulation-induced side effects while preserving tremor suppression effects in patients with tremor.CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class IV evidence that for patients with tremor with thalamic DBS, acute short pulse stimulation reduces adverse effects, while directional steering does not provide a generalizable benefit regarding adverse effects.
Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome (WHS) and Patau syndrome are two of the most severe conditions resulting from chromosome abnormalities. WHS is caused by a deletion of 4p16, while Patau syndrome is caused by trisomy for some or all regions of chromosome 13. Though the etiologies of these syndromes differ, they share several features including pre- and postnatal growth retardation, microcephaly, cleft lip and palate, and cardiac anomalies. We present here a female fetus with deletion of 4p16 --> pter and duplication of 13q32 --> qter due to unbalanced segregation of t(4;13)(p16;q32) in the father. She displayed overlapping features of both of these syndromes on ultrasound. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a fetus with both partial trisomy 13 and deletion of 4p16, the critical region for WHS.
BACKGROUND: Improving health-related quality of life is a primary target of therapy for patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Physical activity has been demonstrated to improve health-related quality of life in several patient populations with chronic disease. There are very few studies investigating the effects of physical activity on health-related quality of life in inflammatory bowel disease. The primary purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of 10 weeks of moderate physical activity on health-related quality of life in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.METHODS: Thirty patients with mild to moderate IBD (Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) <220 or Rachmilewitz Index (RI) <11) were randomized 1:1 to either supervised moderate-intensity running thrice a week for 10 weeks or a control group who were not prescribed any exercise. Health-related quality of life, symptoms, and inflammation were assessed at baseline and after 10 weeks.RESULTS: Participants were 41 ± 14 years (73% female), had a body mass index of 22.8 ± 4.1 kg/m(2), and an average CDAI or RI of 66.8 ± 42.4 and 3.6 ± 3.1. No adverse events occurred during the 10-week training period. Health-related quality of life, reported as IBDQ total score, improved 19% in the intervention group and 8% in the control group. Scores for the IBDQ social sub-scale were significantly improved in the intervention group compared with controls (ΔIBDQsocial = 6.27 ± 5.46 vs. 1.87 ± 4.76, p = 0.023).CONCLUSION: Patients suffering from moderately active IBD are capable of performing symptom-free regular endurance exercise. Our data support the assumption that PA is feasible in IBD patients. PA may furthermore improve quality of life through improvements in social well-being, and may, therefore, be a useful adjunct to IBD therapy.
Sleep loss places caregivers at risk for poor health. Understanding correlates of sleep loss and relationships to health may enable improvement of health of caregivers of individuals with primary malignant brain tumors (PMBT). In this cross-sectional, descriptive study of 133 caregivers, relationships were examined between sleep loss and physical, mental, emotional, and social health at time of patient diagnosis. Sleep loss was not related to physical health. Shorter total sleep time was associated with greater fatigue and social support. Sleep quality was positively associated with quality of life. Further study is needed of the role of sleep loss in the PMBT caregiving trajectory and its long-term relationship with health outcomes.
Pre-clinical and clinical data suggest that the development of a safe and effective anti-amyloid-beta (Abeta) immunotherapy for Alzheimer's disease (AD) will require therapeutic levels of anti-Abeta antibodies, while avoiding proinflammatory adjuvants and autoreactive T cells which may increase the incidence of adverse events in the elderly population targeted to receive immunotherapy. The first active immunization clinical trial with AN1792 in AD patients was halted when a subset of patients developed meningoencephalitis. The first passive immunotherapy trial with bapineuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against the end terminus of Abeta, also encountered some dose dependent adverse events during the Phase II portion of the study, vasogenic edema in 12 cases, which were significantly over represented in ApoE4 carriers. The proposed remedy is to treat future patients with lower doses, particularly in the ApoE4 carriers. Currently there are at least five ongoing anti-Abeta immunotherapy clinical trials. Three of the clinical trials use humanized monoclonal antibodies, which are expensive and require repeated dosing to maintain therapeutic levels of the antibodies in the patient. However in the event of an adverse response to the passive therapy antibody delivery can simply be halted, which may provide a resolution to the problem. Because at this point we cannot readily identify individuals in the preclinical or prodromal stages of AD pathogenesis, passive immunotherapy is reserved for those that already have clinical symptoms. Unfortunately those individuals have by that point accumulated substantial neuropathology in affected regions of the brain. Moreover, if Abeta pathology drives tau pathology as reported in several transgenic animal models, and once established if tau pathology can become self propagating, then early intervention with anti-Abeta immunotherapy may be critical for favorable clinical outcomes. On the other hand, active immunization has several significant advantages, including lower cost and the typical immunization protocol should be much less intrusive to the patient relative to passive therapy, in the advent of Abeta-antibody immune complex-induced adverse events the patients will have to receive immuno-supperssive therapy for an extended period until the anti Abeta antibody levels drop naturally as the effects of the vaccine decays over time. Obviously, improvements in vaccine design are needed to improve both the safety, as well as the efficacy of anti-Abeta immunotherapy. The focus of this review is on the advantages of DNA vaccination for anti-Abeta immunotherapy, and the major hurdles, such as immunosenescence, selection of appropriate molecular adjuvants, universal T cell epitopes, and possibly a polyepitope design based on utilizing existing memory T cells in the general population that were generated in response to childhood or seasonal vaccines, as well as various infections. Ultimately, we believe that the further refinement of our AD DNA epitope vaccines, possibly combined with a prime boost regime will facilitate translation to human clinical trials in either very early AD, or preferably in preclinical stage individuals identified by validated AD biomarkers.
Groucho (Gro) is a Drosophila melanogaster transcriptional corepressor that directly interacts with the histone deacetylase Rpd3. Although previous studies suggest that this interaction is required for repression of Gro-responsive reporters in cultured cells, the in vivo significance of this interaction and the mechanism by which it leads to repression remain largely unexplored. In this study, we show that Gro is partially dependent on Rpd3 for repression, supporting the idea that Rpd3-mediated repression is one mode of Gro-mediated repression. We demonstrate that Gro colocalizes with Rpd3 to the chromatin of a target gene and that this is accompanied by the deacetylation of specific lysines within the N-terminal tails of histones H3 and H4. Gro overexpression leads to wing patterning defects and ectopic repression in the wing disc of transcription directed by the vestigial quadrant enhancer. These effects are reversed by the histone deacetylase inhibitors TSA and HC-Toxin and by the reduction of Rpd3 gene dosage. Furthermore, repression of the vestigial quadrant enhancer is accompanied by a Gro-mediated increase in nucleosome density, an effect that is reversed by histone deacetylase inhibitors. We propose a model in which Gro-mediated histone deacetylation results in increased nucleosome density leading to transcriptional repression.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of 50- and 100-mg/day doses of desvenlafaxine (administered as desvenlafaxine succinate), a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD).RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) MDD and 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D(17)) scores > or =20 were randomly assigned to double-blind placebo or desvenlafaxine treatment (fixed dose of 50 mg/day or 100 mg/day) for 8 weeks. The primary efficacy measure was the HAM-D(17). Changes from baseline in HAM-D(17) scores were analyzed using analysis of covariance. The final on-therapy evaluation was the primary endpoint for efficacy analyses, using last-observation-carried-forward data. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES AND RESULTS: The intent-to-treat population included 447 patients. Desvenlafaxine 50 mg was associated with a significantly greater adjusted mean change from baseline on the HAM-D(17) (-11.5) compared with placebo (-9.5, p=0.018); the 100-mg dose group (-11.0) did not achieve statistical significance (p=0.065). The 100-mg dose group experienced significant improvements compared with placebo on several secondary efficacy measures, including the 6-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (p=0.038) and the Visual Analog Scale-Pain Intensity total score (p=0.041). Both desvenlafaxine doses were generally well-tolerated. The most common adverse events (incidence > or =10% in either desvenlafaxine group and twice the rate of placebo) were dry mouth, constipation, insomnia, decreased appetite, hyperhidrosis, and dizziness.CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate efficacy, safety, and tolerability of desvenlafaxine 50 mg/day for treating MDD. The significant findings on secondary measures support the efficacy of desvenlafaxine 100 mg, as seen in other trials. Conclusions may be limited by the exclusion of MDD patients with comorbid conditions and the short-term desvenlafaxine treatment duration.
The muscle-CAT (M-CAT) promoter element is found on promoters of most muscle-specific cardiac genes, but its role in cardiac pathology is poorly understood. Here we studied whether the M-CAT element is involved in hypertrophic process activated by mechanical stretch, and identified the intracellular pathways mediating the response. When an in vitro stretch model of cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes and luciferase reporter construct driven by rat B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) promoter were used, mutation of M-CAT element inhibited not only the basal reporter activity (88%), but also the stretch-activated BNP transcription (58%, p < 0.001). Stretch-induced BNP promoter activation was associated with an increase in transcriptional enhancer factor-1 (TEF-1) binding activity after 24 h mechanical stretch (p < 0.05). Inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinases ERK, JNK, or p38 attenuated stretch-induced BNP activation. Interestingly, as opposed to p38 and JNK, inhibition of ERK had no additional effect on transcriptional activity of BNP promoter harboring the M-CAT mutation, suggesting a pivotal role for ERK in regulating stretch-induced BNP transcription via M-CAT binding site. Finally, immunoprecipitation studies showed that mechanical stretch induced myocyte enhancer factor-2 (MEF-2) binding to TEF-1. These data suggest a central role for M-CAT element in regulation of mechanical stretch-induced hypertrophic response via ERK activation.
Gfi-1B (growth factor independence-1B) gene is an erythroid-specific transcription factor, whose expression plays an essential role in erythropoiesis. Our laboratory has previously defined the human Gfi-1B promoter region and shown that GATA-1 mediates erythroid-specific Gfi-1B transcription. By further investigating the regulation of the Gfi-1B promoter, here we report that (i) Gfi-1B transcription is negatively regulated by its own gene product, (ii) GATA-1, instead of Gfi-1B, binds directly to the Gfi-1-like sites in the Gfi-1B promoter and (iii) Gfi-1B suppresses GATA-1-mediated stimulation of Gfi-1B promoter through their protein interaction. These results not only demonstrate that interaction of GATA-1 and Gfi-1B participates in a feedback regulatory pathway in controlling the expression of the Gfi-1B gene, but also provide the first evidence that Gfi-1B can exert its repression function by acting on GATA-1-mediated transcription without direct binding to the Gfi-1 site of the target genes. Based on these data, we propose that this negative auto-regulatory feedback loop is important in restricting the expression level of Gfi-1B, thus optimizing its function in erythroid cells.
A prospective case-control study was undertaken to assess respiratory disability in 133 former coal miners who were claimants for "black lung" benefits. Consecutive assignment was made to either case or control group based on their chest radiograph having shown coal workers' pneumoconiosis or no coal workers' pneumoconiosis. A respiratory occupational survey was completed with physical examination that placed special emphasis on the cardiorespiratory systems. Subjects underwent pulmonary function testing while 92 of these also received arterial blood gases to assess respiratory disability and pulmonary insufficiency. Arterial blood gases were superior to spirometry in assessment of pulmonary insufficiency/disability. Smoking interacts with coal workers' pneumoconiosis to cause pulmonary insufficiency. The most frequent spirometric pattern was obstructive. Disability was caused by occupational injuries and comorbidities, both of which occurred with greater frequency in miners with coal workers' pneumoconiosis than in controls. Pulmonary insufficiency appears to be a better discriminator than respiratory disability in coal miners, suggesting that arterial blood gases replace spirometry in their evaluation. Greater emphasis on smoking intervention among coal miners should be given.
AIM: This study aims to investigate the mode of action of a novel sirtuin inhibitor (BZD9L1) and its associated molecular pathways in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells.MATERIALS & METHODS: BZD9L1 was tested against metastatic CRC cell lines to evaluate cytotoxicity, cell cycle and apoptosis, senescence, apoptosis related genes and protein expressions, as well as effect against major cancer signaling pathways.RESULTS & CONCLUSION: BZD9L1 reduced the viability, cell migration and colony forming ability of both HCT 116 and HT-29 metastatic CRC cell lines through apoptosis. BZD9L1 regulated major cancer pathways differently in CRC with different mutation profiles. BZD9L1 exhibited anticancer activities as a cytotoxic drug in CRC and as a promising therapeutic strategy in CRC treatment.
ZMapp, a cocktail of three monoclonal antibodies (MAbs; c2G4, c4G7, and c13C6) against the ebolavirus (EBOV) glycoprotein (GP), shows promise for combatting outbreaks of EBOV, as occurred in West Africa in 2014. Prior studies showed that Fabs from these MAbs bind a soluble EBOV GP ectodomain and that MAbs c2G4 and c4G7, but not c13C6, neutralize infections in cell cultures. Using cryo-electron tomography, we extended these findings by characterizing the structures of c2G4, c4G7, and c13C6 IgGs bound to native, full-length GP from the West African 2014 isolate embedded in filamentous viruslike particles (VLPs). As with the isolated ectodomain, c13C6 bound to the glycan cap, whereas c2G4 and c4G7 bound to the base region of membrane-bound GP. The tomographic data suggest that all three MAbs bind with high occupancy and that the base-binding antibodies can potentially bridge neighboring GP spikes. Functional studies indicated that c2G4 and c4G7, but not c13C6, competitively inhibit entry of VLPs bearing EBOV GP into the host cell cytoplasm, without blocking trafficking of VLPs to NPC1(+) endolysosomes, where EBOV fuses. Moreover, c2G4 and c4G7 bind to and can block entry mediated by the primed (19-kDa) form of GP without impeding binding of the C-loop of NPC1, the endolysosomal receptor for EBOV. The most likely mode of action of c2G4 and c4G7 is therefore by inhibiting conformational changes in primed, NPC1-bound GP that initiate fusion between the viral and target membranes, similar to the action of certain broadly neutralizing antibodies against influenza hemagglutinin and HIV Env.IMPORTANCE: The recent West African outbreak of ebolavirus caused the deaths of more than 11,000 individuals. Hence, there is an urgent need to be prepared with vaccines and therapeutics for similar future disasters. ZMapp, a cocktail of three MAbs directed against the ebolavirus glycoprotein, is a promising anti-ebolavirus therapeutic. Using cryo-electron tomography, we provide structural information on how each of the MAbs in this cocktail binds to the ebolavirus glycoprotein as it is displayed-embedded in the membrane and present at high density-on filamentous viruslike particles that recapitulate the surface structure and entry functions of ebolavirus. Moreover, after confirming that two of the MAbs bind to the same region in the base of the glycoprotein, we show that they competitively block the entry function of the glycoprotein and that they can do so after the glycoprotein is proteolytically primed and bound to its intracellular receptor, Niemann-Pick C1. These findings should inform future developments of ebolavirus therapeutics.
Transcription-coupled DNA repair uses components of the transcription machinery to identify DNA lesions and initiate their repair. These repair pathways are complex, so their mechanistic features remain poorly understood. Bacterial transcription-coupled repair is initiated when RNA polymerase stalled at a DNA lesion is removed by Mfd, an ATP-dependent DNA translocase. Here we use single-molecule DNA nanomanipulation to observe the dynamic interactions of Escherichia coli Mfd with RNA polymerase elongation complexes stalled by a cyclopyrimidine dimer or by nucleotide starvation. We show that Mfd acts by catalysing two irreversible, ATP-dependent transitions with different structural, kinetic and mechanistic features. Mfd remains bound to the DNA in a long-lived complex that could act as a marker for sites of DNA damage, directing assembly of subsequent DNA repair factors. These results provide a framework for considering the kinetics of transcription-coupled repair in vivo, and open the way to reconstruction of complete DNA repair pathways at single-molecule resolution.
CONTEXT: Pheochromocytoma is a rare disease but with high mortality if it is not being diagnosed early. Several biochemical tests with high accuracy have been obtained, but the clinical threshold for request of these tests is not determined clearly.OBJECTIVES: To determine the Likelihood Ratios of clinical symptoms and signs in diagnosing pheochromocytoma. And also meta-analysis of their sensitivity in this disease.DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE was searched for relevant English-language articles dated 1960 to February 2014. Bibliographies were searched to find additional articles.STUDY SELECTION: We included original studies describing the sensitivity and/or likelihood ratios of signs and symptoms in clinical suspicion of pheochromocytoma. Their method of diagnosis should have been based on pathology. We excluded specific subtypes or syndromes related to pheochromocytoma, or specific ages or gender. Also we excluded studies before 1993 (JNC5) which no definition of hypertension was presented. 37 articles were chosen finally.DATA EXTRACTION: Two authors reviewed data from articles independently and gave discrepancies to third author for decision. The aim was extraction of raw numbers of patients having defined signs or symptoms, and draw 2 × 2 tables if data available. We meta-analyzed sensitivities by Statsdirect and Likelihood Ratios by Meta-disc soft wares. Because our data was heterogeneous based on I(2) > 50 % (except negative Likelihood ratio of hypertension), we used random effect model for doing meta-analysis. We checked publication bias by drawing Funnel plot for each sign/symptom, and also Egger test.DATA SYNTHESIS: The most prevalent signs and symptoms reported were hypertension (pooled sensitivity of 80.7 %), headache (pooled sensitivity of 60.4 %), palpitation (pooled sensitivity of 59.3 %) and diaphoresis (pooled sensitivity of 52.4 %). The definition of orthostatic hypotension was different among studies. The sensitivity was 23-50 %. Paroxysmal hypertension, chest pain, flushing, and weakness were the signs/symptoms which had publication bias based on Funnel plot and Egger test (P value < 0.05). Seven of the articles had control group, and could be used for calculating LR of signs/symptoms. Diaphoresis (LR+ 2.2, LR- 0.45), Palpitation (LR+ 1.9, LR- 0.52) and headache (LR+ 1.6, LR- 0.24) were significant symptoms in clinical diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. Other signs and symptoms had been reported in only one study and could not have been meta-analyzed. Classic triad of headache, palpitation and diaphoresis in hypertensive patients had the LR+ 6.312 (95 % CI 0.217-183.217) and LR- 0.139 (95 % CI 0.059-0.331). Surprisingly, hypertension was not important in clinical suspicion of pheochromocytoma, and even normotension increased the probability of the disease.CONCLUSIONS: By available data, there is no single clinical finding that has significant value in diagnosis or excluding pheochromocytoma. Combination of certain symptoms, signs and para-clinical exams is more valuable for physicians. Further studies should be done, to specify the value of clinical findings. Until that time the process of diagnosis will be based on clinical suspicion and lab tests followed by related imaging.
The effects of 2-[4-[(2,5-difluorophenyl) methoxy]phenoxy]-5-ethoxyaniline (SEA0400), a newly synthesized Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchanger (NCX) inhibitor, on the NCX current and other membrane currents were examined in isolated guinea-pig ventricular myocytes and compared with those of 2-[2-[4-(4-nitrobenzyloxy) phenyl]ethyl]isothiourea (KB-R7943). SEA0400 concentration-dependently inhibited the NCX current with a 10 fold higher potency than that of KB-R7943; 1 microM SEA0400 and 10 microM KB-R7943 inhibited the NCX current by more than 80%. KB-R7943, at 10 microM, inhibited the sodium current, L-type calcium current, delayed rectifier potassium current and inwardly rectifying potassium current by more than 50%, but SEA0400 (1 microM) had no significant effect on these currents. These results indicate that SEA0400 is a potent and highly selective inhibitor of NCX, and would be a powerful tool for further studies on the role of NCX in the heart and the therapeutic potential of its inhibition.
Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) bearing tumor-specific mutation and methylation are promising biomarkers for noninvasive cancer assessment. However, existing methods for ctDNA detection are restricted to genetic mutations. Recently, nanoplasmonics has emerged as a platform for one-step dual detection with high sensitivity and specificity. Here we present a strategy for ultrasensitive detection of tumor-specific mutations (E542K and E545K) and methylation of ctDNA of PIK3CA gene based on localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) and the coupling plasmon mode of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). Peptide nucleic acids (PNA) is used as a probe to capture and enrich the 69-bp PIK3CA ctDNA. The exposure of PNA-probed AuNPs to 200 fM ctDNA generates LSPR-peak shift of 4.3 nm, corresponding to the primary response. Immunogold colloids are exploited as methylation detectors and plasmon coupling based enhancement for secondary response. LSPR-peak shifted from 4.3 nm to 11.4 nm upon the immunogold colloids binding to two methylcytosines (mCpG), which is an approximately 107% increase, compared to that of the primary response. This enhancement leads to four times (~50 fM) improvement of sensitivity and because of two mCpG sites, ctDNA was detected. These results demonstrate that the sensor can simultaneously detect the hot-spot mutation and epigenetic changes on the ctDNA. Promisingly, other specific-tumor mutants and epigenetic changes can be detected at low concentration with this platform.
This review discusses the landmark studies in the field of multiple myeloma (MM) which were presented at American society of hematology annual meeting, 2016. There were contrary results from two large phase III trials (one from US and one from Europe) that evaluated the role of additional interventions like tandem autologous transplant (ASCT) and consolidation after induction therapy followed by ASCT in newly diagnosed MM (NDMM) patients, but there were critical differences between the two studies. Novel agents like carfilzomib and ixazomib proved to be of benefit when used as induction and post ASCT consolidation and maintenance in NDMM. The early data on subcutaneous administration of daratumumab (DARA) looked promising. The high rate of minimal residual disease negativity after using DARA even in relapsed/refractory MM (RRMM) setting reinforces the benefit of targeting CD38. The responses seen with venetoclax in RRMM with t(11;14)(high BCL-2, low BCL-XL and MCL-1) and selinexor in penta-refractory myeloma which fulfills the FDA category of unmet need, opens up newer options for these patients. BCMA CAR-T infusion shows encouraging results in advanced refractory myeloma patients.
Ameloblastoma is a rare odontogenic tumor of the jaw. It is a benign neoplasm but local recurrence is common. Metastasis from this tumor is all the more rare. The commonest site for metastasis is lung. Brain is a very uncommon site of involvement. Overall prognosis is good. We hereby discuss ameloblastoma of lower jaw in a young adult which had metastasized to brain. Patient was operated for the metastatic lesion of brain and is doing well on follow-up.
MutT-related proteins, including Escherichia coli MutT and the human MTH1 (NUDT1), degrade 8-oxo-7, 8-dihydrodeoxyguanosine triphosphate (8-oxo-dGTP) to 8-oxo-dGMP and thereby prevent mutations caused by the misincorporation of 8-oxoguanine into DNA. The human NUDT5, which has an intrinsic activity to cleave ADP sugars to AMP and sugar phosphate, possesses the ability to degrade 8-oxo-dGDP to the monophosphate. Since 8-oxo-dGDP and 8-oxo-dGTP are interconvertible by cellular enzymes, NUDT5 has the potential to prevent errors during DNA replication. The two activities associated with NUDT5 exhibit different pH dependencies; the optimum for the cleavage of ADP ribose is pH 7-9, while that for 8-oxo-dGDPase is around pH 10. The kinetic parameters for the two types of reactions indicated that ADP ribose is a better substrate for NUDT5 compared with oxidized guanine nucleotides. The 8-oxo-dGDP cleavage was competitively inhibited by ADP ribose and its reaction product, AMP, and in reverse, the cleavage of ADP ribose was inhibited by 8-oxo-dGDP. These results imply that the two types of substrates may share the same binding site for catalysis.
Atrial arrhythmias resistant to medical therapy are still a common indication for ablation of the normal atrioventricular conduction pathway (Tawara node and His Bundle). However, the development of catheter techniques of intra-atrial ablation to destroy arrhythmogenic myocardial zones enables radical cure of the arrhythmias with the respect of the nodo-hisian pathway. With respect to common flutter, a number of series, including our own, show a 50 to 75% long-term success rate. We believe that a very high success rate in the ablation of flutter will probably be achieved in a reproducible manner but this will require a more accurate understanding of the tachycardia circuit and technological developments allowing controlled radio-frequency destruction of bigger atrial myocardial zone. Experience of radio-frequency ablation atrial of atrial extrasystoles is more limited than that of flutter and there are fewer published series. Globally, catheter ablation of atrial tachycardia remains a more difficult and a less well codified procedure than that of accessory pathways or of intra-nodal reentry. Radio-frequency ablation in this indication is not without danger in view of the thinness of the atrial wall. We believe that radio-frequency catheter ablation for atrial arrhythmias should, for the moment, be reserved for centres specialised in the techniques of electro-physiological investigation and ablation.
PURPOSE: Most node-negative breast cancer patients are older and postmenopausal and are increasingly being offered adjuvant chemotherapy despite their low overall risk of distant relapse. A molecular diagnostic test with high negative predictive value (NPV) for distant metastasis in this subgroup would spare many older breast cancer patients adjuvant treatment.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We determined the NPV and positive predictive value of the MammaPrint assay in breast cancer patients who were consecutively diagnosed and treated at the Massachusetts General Hospital between 1985 and 1997. Primary tumors from 100 patients with node-negative, invasive breast cancer (median age, 62.5 years; median follow-up, 11.3 years) were subjected to MammaPrint analysis and classified as being at either low or high risk for distant metastasis.RESULTS: The MammaPrint 70-gene signature displayed excellent NPV as in previous studies, correctly identifying 100% of women at low risk for distant metastases at 5 years. However, this assay had a lower positive predictive value (12% at 5 years) than previously observed.CONCLUSIONS: The MammaPrint assay was originally designed to identify younger breast cancer patients at low risk for distant metastasis, who might consequently be spared systemic treatment. We show here that the same signature has a very high NPV for distant recurrence after adjuvant treatment in older breast cancer patients.
Burning Mouth Syndrome (BMS) is a difficult disease for patients and clinicians. Moreover, there is not a general consensus on how to treat the disease. The main objective of this paper is to evaluate BMS patients' response to topical clonazepam treatment. A double blind study was performed. Among a total of 66 patients, 33 were treated with tablets of clonazepam and another 33 were treated with a placebo. Symptoms were evaluated after 1 month and 6 months of treatment and scored on an analogical scale from 0 to 10. Among the 33 patients treated with clonazepam, 23 showed at least a 50% reduction in symptoms after 1 month of treatment. On the contrary, only 4 in the placebo group exhibited significant improvement. After 6 months, significant differences were observed again, as 23 of the 33 patients treated with the drug reported at least a 50% reduction in symptoms, whereas only 2 among those treated with the placebo significantly improved. However, when measured in terms of a complete cure (lack of symptoms), the differences were not significant: 5 drug-treated patients and one belonging to the placebo group were asymptomatic after one month of treatment. In summary, it seems that clonazepam applied topically was effective in treating BMS in a large proportion of patients.
The concept of molecular tumor targeting might provide new hope in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer. We evaluated metastasis blocking properties of the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor valproic acid (VPA) and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor RAD001 on prostate cancer cell lines. RAD001 or VPA were applied to PC-3 or LNCaP cells, either separately or in combination. Adhesion to vascular endothelium or to immobilized collagen, fibronectin or laminin was quantified. Migration and invasion were explored by a modified Boyden chamber assay. Integrin α and β subtypes were analyzed by flow cytometry, western blotting and RT-PCR. Effects of drug treatment on integrin related signaling, Akt and p70S6kinase activation, histone H3 and H4 acetylation were also determined. Separate application of RAD001 or VPA distinctly reduced tumor cell adhesion, migration and invasion, accompanied by elevated Akt activation and p70S6kinase de-activation. Integrin subtype expression was altered significantly by both compounds (VPA > RAD001). When both drugs were used in concert additive effects were observed on the migratory and invasive behavior but not on tumor-endothelium and tumor-matrix interaction. Separate mTOR or HDAC inhibition slows processes related to tumor metastasis. The RAD001-VPA combination showed advantage over VPA monotreatment with particular respect to migration and invasion. Ongoing studies are required to assess the relevance of VPA monotherapy versus VPA-RAD001 combination on tumor cell motility.
BACKGROUND: WHIM syndrome (WS), a rare congenital neutropenia due to mutations of the CXCR4 chemokine receptor, is associated with Human Papillomavirus (HPV)-induced Warts, Hypogammaglobulinemia, bacterial Infections and Myelokathexis. The long term follow up of eight patients highlights the clinical heterogeneity of this disease as well as the main therapeutic approaches and remaining challenges in the light of the recent development of new CXCR4 inhibitors.OBJECTIVE: This study aims to describe the natural history of WS based on a French cohort of 8 patients.METHODS: We have reviewed the clinical, biological and immunological features of patients with WS enrolled into the French Severe Chronic Neutropenia Registry.RESULTS: We identified four pedigrees with WS comprised of eight patients and one foetus. Estimated incidence for WS was of 0.23 per million births. Median age at the last visit was 29 years. Three pedigrees encompassing seven patients and the fetus displayed autosomal dominant heterozygous mutations of the CXCR4 gene, while one patient presented a wild-type CXCR4 gene. Two subjects exhibited congenital conotruncal heart malformations. In addition to neutropenia and myelokathexis, all patients presented deep monocytopenia and lymphopenia. Seven patients presented repeated bacterial Ears Nose Throat as well as severe bacterial infections that were curable with antibiotics. Four patients with late onset prophylaxis developed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Two patients reported atypical mycobacteria infections which in one case may have been responsible for one patient's death due to liver failure at the age of 40.6 years. HPV-related disease manifested in five subjects and progressed as invasive vulvar carcinoma with a fatal course in one patient at the age of 39.5 years. In addition, two patients developed T cell lymphoma skin cancer and basal cell carcinoma at the age of 38 and 65 years.CONCLUSIONS: Continuous prophylactic anti-infective measures, when started in early childhood, seem to effectively prevent further bacterial infections and the consequent development of COPD. Long-term follow up is needed to evaluate the effect of early anti-HPV targeted prophylaxis on the development of skin and genital warts.
BACKGROUND AND AIM: Extremely poor prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with progressing disease was denoted by vascular invasion. Cytokeratin 18 (CK18) has been shown to be overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma so it is a valuable tumor marker; however, its role in vascular invasion is still unclear. This study aimed to predict CK18 as a predictive marker for macrovascular malignant invasion.METHODS: The present study was conducted on three groups of patients: group I included 91 HCC patients without macrovascular invasion, group II included 34 HCC patients with radiological evidence of vascular invasion, and group III included 110 control individuals subdivided into IIIA as healthy blood donors and IIIB as post-HCV cirrhotic patients without HCC.RESULTS: ROC curve of M30 fragments of CK18 was constructed for discrimination between HCC with and without macrovascular invasion. Optimum cutoff value was 304.5 ng/mL (AUC = 0.997, P < 0.001), sensitivity (100%) and specificity (98.8%). Regression analysis was conducted for prediction of macrovascular invasion within HCC patients. The following variables: higher levels of AST, M30, bilirubin, and AFP, lower levels of serum albumin, larger tumor size, child B score, and multiple lesions were associated with vascular invasion in univariate analysis. While in multivariate analysis, higher levels of AST and bilirubin and elevated levels of M30 and AFP serum were considered independent predictors for macrovascular invasion in HCC patients.CONCLUSION: The present study suggests that increased M30 fragments of CK18 levels may be useful as a possible marker of early tumor invasiveness.
The conserved polarity proteins Par6 and aPKC regulate cell polarization processes. However, increasing evidence also suggests that they play a role in oncogenic progression. During tumor progression, epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) delineates an evolutionary conserved process that converts stationary epithelial cells into mesenchymal cells, which have an acquired ability for independent migration and invasion. In addition to signaling pathways that alter genetic programes that trigger the loss of cell-cell adhesion, alternative pathways can alter cell plasticity to regulate cell-cell cohesion and increase invasive potential. One such pathway involves TGFβ-induced phosphorylation of Par6. In epithelial cells, Par6 phosphorylation results in the dissolution of junctional complexes, cytoskeletal remodelling, and increased metastatic potential. Recently, we found that aPKC can also phosphorylate Par6 to drive EMT and increase the migratory potential of non-small cell lung cancer cells. This result has implications with respect to homeostatic and developmental processes involving polarization, and also with respect to cancer progression-particularly since aPKC has been reported to be an oncogenic regulator in various tumor cells.
The FasL-Fas couple is a general death mediator whose activated signals lead to caspase-8 activation and apoptosis in adult hepatocytes. Suppression of caspase-8 activation and cell death is a protective mechanism modulated by the FLICE-Like Inhibitory Protein (FLIP). Although hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and its receptor Met are known to mediate cell survival in developing livers, the molecular mechanisms involved in this process are poorly understood. We show here that Met activation by HGF impairs Fas-triggered apoptosis of primary embryonic hepatocytes and cell survival correlates with inhibition of caspase-8 and caspase-3 activities. Furthermore, we found that HGF treatment prevents degradation of FLIPL triggered by Fas activation. In contrast to this, Met activation does not modulate FLIPL levels and its stability in untreated cells, thus showing the specificity of this regulatory mechanism for embryonic hepatocyte survival. Knocking down FLIP expression abolishes the ability of Met to inhibit Fas-triggered hepatocyte death, demonstrating the functional requirement of FLIP in HGF anti-apoptotic signals. By combining genetic and pharmacological approaches, we also demonstrate that the PI3K-Akt pathway is required in embryonic hepatocytes to prevent Fas-triggered FLIP degradation and death. Thus, Met acting on PI3K and Akt ensures high levels of FLIPL, and disruption of this pathway contributes to hepatic apoptosis and possibly to Fas-related liver diseases.
Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the developed countries. This review summarizes current pre-clinical and clinical evidence for the potential role and mechanisms of action of stem and progenitor cells in vascular and cardiac repair and regeneration. Apart from cell transplantation strategies, approaches to maintain stem cell niche function and targeting mobilization/recruitment of specific stem/progenitor cell populations may aid in preserving vascular and cardiac function. Moreover, with the use of patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells, the field of regenerative medicine is entering a new era. Potential applications of induced pluripotent stem cells and direct reprogrammed cells as well as recent developments in tissue engineering are discussed.
BACKGROUND: Gaucher disease is a rare lysosomal storage disease resulting from a deficiency or reduced activity in the acid β-glucocosidase enzyme. Only 1 treatment option was available for 15 years, but several new treatment options have come to market since 2003.OBJECTIVE: The article will detail the pathophysiology and review current therapies in the literature for all 3 major clinical types of Gaucher disease, with a focus on considerations for selecting therapy in type 1 disease.METHODS: Extracted and summarized applicable studies and reviews from Cochrane Review, ClinicalTrials.gov, CINAHL, IPA, and PubMed.RESULTS: Enzyme replacement therapy is preferred for the management of Gaucher disease. Current literature does not favor any enzyme replacement product over another. However, velaglucerase alfa and taliglucerase alfa theoretically have a lower risk of immunogenicity reactions compared with imiglucerase. Alternative treatments for type 1 disease include substrate reduction therapy; however, these treatments require evaluation of patient-specific variables (eg, genotype evaluation, renal function) and consideration of adverse effect and dosing profiles. Evaluation of current literature found no substrate reduction therapy is preferred over another. There are no approved therapies for type 2 and type 3 disease, but enzyme replacement therapy may be used with limited efficacy for symptom management.CONCLUSION: Enzyme replacement therapy is preferred for treating type 1 Gaucher disease and substrate replacement therapy may be considered in patients who do not tolerate or cannot receive enzyme replacement therapy.
Effects of high-dose TRH on the vibratory inhibition of soleus H-reflex have been studied in 9 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In 6 of the 9, TRH induced a significant increase in vibratory inhibition. This suggests that the TRH-induced reduction of spasticity might be due to an increase in presynaptic inhibition acting on Ia fibres.
Cephalochordates, urochordates, and vertebrates evolved from a common ancestor over 520 million years ago. To improve our understanding of chordate evolution and the origin of vertebrates, we intensively searched for particular genes, gene families, and conserved noncoding elements in the sequenced genome of the cephalochordate Branchiostoma floridae, commonly called amphioxus or lancelets. Special attention was given to homeobox genes, opsin genes, genes involved in neural crest development, nuclear receptor genes, genes encoding components of the endocrine and immune systems, and conserved cis-regulatory enhancers. The amphioxus genome contains a basic set of chordate genes involved in development and cell signaling, including a fifteenth Hox gene. This set includes many genes that were co-opted in vertebrates for new roles in neural crest development and adaptive immunity. However, where amphioxus has a single gene, vertebrates often have two, three, or four paralogs derived from two whole-genome duplication events. In addition, several transcriptional enhancers are conserved between amphioxus and vertebrates--a very wide phylogenetic distance. In contrast, urochordate genomes have lost many genes, including a diversity of homeobox families and genes involved in steroid hormone function. The amphioxus genome also exhibits derived features, including duplications of opsins and genes proposed to function in innate immunity and endocrine systems. Our results indicate that the amphioxus genome is elemental to an understanding of the biology and evolution of nonchordate deuterostomes, invertebrate chordates, and vertebrates.
BACKGROUND: Patients with advanced sarcomas have a poor prognosis and few treatment options that improve overall survival. Chemotherapy and targeted therapies offer short-lived disease control. We assessed pembrolizumab, an anti-PD-1 antibody, for safety and activity in patients with advanced soft-tissue sarcoma or bone sarcoma.METHODS: In this two-cohort, single-arm, open-label, phase 2 study, we enrolled patients with soft-tissue sarcoma or bone sarcoma from 12 academic centres in the USA that were members of the Sarcoma Alliance for Research through Collaboration (SARC). Patients with soft-tissue sarcoma had to be aged 18 years or older to enrol; patients with bone sarcoma could enrol if they were aged 12 years or older. Patients had histological evidence of metastatic or surgically unresectable locally advanced sarcoma, had received up to three previous lines of systemic anticancer therapy, had at least one measurable lesion according to the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors version 1.1, and had at least one lesion accessible for biopsy. All patients were treated with 200 mg intravenous pembrolizumab every 3 weeks. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed objective response. Patients who received at least one dose of pembrolizumab were included in the safety analysis and patients who progressed or reached at least one scan assessment were included in the activity analysis. Accrual is ongoing in some disease cohorts. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02301039.FINDINGS: Between March 13, 2015, and Feb 18, 2016, we enrolled 86 patients, 84 of whom received pembrolizumab (42 in each disease cohort) and 80 of whom were evaluable for response (40 in each disease cohort). Median follow-up was 17·8 months (IQR 12·3-19·3). Seven (18%) of 40 patients with soft-tissue sarcoma had an objective response, including four (40%) of ten patients with undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, two (20%) of ten patients with liposarcoma, and one (10%) of ten patients with synovial sarcoma. No patients with leiomyosarcoma (n=10) had an objective response. Two (5%) of 40 patients with bone sarcoma had an objective response, including one (5%) of 22 patients with osteosarcoma and one (20%) of five patients with chondrosarcoma. None of the 13 patients with Ewing's sarcoma had an objective response. The most frequent grade 3 or worse adverse events were anaemia (six [14%]), decreased lymphocyte count (five [12%]), prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (four [10%]), and decreased platelet count (three [7%]) in the bone sarcoma group, and anaemia, decreased lymphocyte count, and prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time in the soft-tissue sarcoma group (three [7%] each). Nine (11%) patients (five [12%] in the bone sarcoma group and four [10%] in the soft-tissue sarcoma group) had treatment-emergent serious adverse events (SAEs), five of whom had immune-related SAEs, including two with adrenal insufficiency, two with pneumonitis, and one with nephritis.INTERPRETATION: The primary endpoint of overall response was not met for either cohort. However, pembrolizumab showed encouraging activity in patients with undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma or dedifferentiated liposarcoma. Enrolment to expanded cohorts of those subtypes is ongoing to confirm and characterise the activity of pembrolizumab.FUNDING: Merck, SARC, Sarcoma Foundation of America, QuadW Foundation, Pittsburgh Cure Sarcoma, and Ewan McGregor.
Central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) is an ophthalmological emergency situation. Known risk factors are arterial hypertension, cardial arrhythmia, arteriosclerosis, hypercholesterolemia and diabetes. Elderly patients should be examined for an arteritic genesis. Young patients (< 45 years) without typical risk factors may suffer from thrombophilia. There is no uniform recommendation on how to treat non-arteritic CRAO. Many different interventions have been suggested in the literature, i. e., massaging the eye, systemic or local reduction of intraocular pressure, anticoagulation, either systemically administered venous thrombolysis or supraselective intra-arterial thrombolysis. In this review we present the causes of CRAO and diagnostic means to detect causes; we also critically discuss previously described therapeutic options. It is our aim to provide a guide through the necessary interdisciplinary diagnostics in co-operation with internal medicine and neurology and to recommend a multimodal therapy in patients with non-arteritic CRAO.
BACKGROUND: Drug patch tests (PTs) can reproduce delayed hypersensitivity to drugs and entail a moderate re-exposure of patients to offending drugs.OBJECTIVES: To determine the value of PTs for identifying the responsible drug in severe cutaneous adverse drug reactions (SCARs) such as acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) and Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN).METHODS: In a multicentre study, PTs were conducted on patients referred for DRESS, AGEP or SJS/TEN within 1 year of their SCAR. All drugs administered in the 2 months prior to and the week following the onset of the SCAR were tested.RESULTS: Among the 134 patients included (48 male, 86 female; mean age 51·7 years), positive drug PTs were obtained for 24 different drugs. These included positive tests for 64% (46/72) of patients with DRESS, 58% (26/45) of those with AGEP and 24% (4/17) of those with SJS/TEN, with only one relapse of AGEP. The value of PTs depended on the type of drug and the type of SCAR (e.g. carbamazepine was positive in 11/13 DRESS cases but none of the five SJS/TEN cases). PTs were frequently positive for beta lactams (22 cases), pristinamycin (11 cases) and in DRESS with pump proton inhibitors (five cases), but were usually negative for allopurinol and salazopyrin. Of 18 patients with DRESS, eight had virus reactivation and positive PTs. In DRESS, multiple drug reactivity was frequent (18% of cases), with patients remaining sensitized many years later.CONCLUSIONS: PTs are useful and safe for identifying agents inducing SCAR.
BACKGROUND & AIMS: Little is known about the efficacy of golimumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -α, for treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC). We evaluated subcutaneous golimumab induction therapy in TNF-α antagonist-naïve patients with moderate-to-severe UC despite conventional treatment.METHODS: We integrated double-blind phase 2 dose-finding and phase 3 dose-confirmation trials in a study of 1064 adults with UC (Mayo score: 6-12; endoscopic subscore ≥ 2; 774 patients in phase 3). Patients were randomly assigned to groups given golimumab doses of 100 mg and then 50 mg (phase 2 only), 200 mg and then 100 mg, or 400 mg and then 200 mg, 2 weeks apart. The phase 3 primary end point was week-6 clinical response. Secondary end points included week-6 clinical remission, mucosal healing, and Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) score change.RESULTS: In phase 2, median changes from baseline in the Mayo score were -1.0, -3.0, -2.0, and -3.0, in the groups given placebo, 100 mg/50 mg, 200/100 mg, and 400/200 mg golimumab, respectively. In phase 3, rates of clinical response at week 6 were 51.0% and 54.9% among patients given 200 mg/100 mg and 400 mg/200 mg golimumab, respectively, vs 30.3% among those given placebo (both, P ≤ .0001). Rates of clinical remission and mucosal healing and mean changes in IBDQ scores were significantly greater in both golimumab groups vs the placebo group (P ≤ .0014, all comparisons). Rates of serious adverse events were 6.1% and 3.0%, and rates of serious infection were 1.8% and 0.5%, in the placebo and golimumab groups, respectively. One patient in the 400 mg/200 mg group died as a result of surgical complications of an ischiorectal abscess.CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with subcutaneous golimumab induces clinical response, remission, and mucosal healing, and increases quality of life in larger percentages of patients with active UC than placebo.

p73, an important developmental gene, shares a high sequence homology with p53 and induces both G(1) cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. However, the molecular mechanisms through which p73 induces apoptosis are unclear. We found that p73-induced apoptosis is mediated by PUMA (p53 up-regulated modulator of apoptosis) induction, which, in turn, causes Bax mitochondrial translocation and cytochrome c release. Overexpression of p73 isoforms promotes cell death and bax promoter transactivation in a time-dependent manner. However, the kinetics of apoptosis do not correlate with the increase of Bax protein levels. Instead, p73-induced mitochondrial translocation of Bax is kinetically compatible with the induction of cell death. p73 is localized in the nucleus and remains nuclear during the induction of cell death, indicating that the effect of p73 on Bax translocation is indirect. The ability of p73 to directly transactivate PUMA and the direct effect of PUMA on Bax conformation and mitochondrial relocalization suggest a molecular link between p73 and the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Our data therefore indicate that PUMA-mediated Bax mitochondrial translocation, rather than its direct transactivation, correlates with cell death. Finally, human DeltaNp73, an isoform lacking the amino-terminal transactivation domain, inhibits TAp73-induced as well as p53-induced apoptosis. The DeltaNp73 isoforms seem therefore to act as dominant negatives, repressing the PUMA/Bax system and, thus, finely tuning p73-induced apoptosis. Our findings demonstrate that p73 elicits apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway using PUMA and Bax as mediators.
The CIDEC protein is located in lipid droplets (LDs) and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is induced in fat deposition. However, the binding domain, the functional domain and the underlying mechanism of CIDEC in stimulating lipid accumulation remain unclear. Here, we investigated the subcellular localization and function of pig CIDEC and confirmed CIDEC promotes unilocular development of LDs, reduces the specific surface area (SSA) of LDs and stimulates lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells. By analyzing a series of CIDEC mutants, we showed the N-domain (1-173 amino acid) is involved in LD localization and the C-domain (174-238 amino acid) is necessary for LD fusion. Further analysis indicated that the 106-173 amino acid region includes an ER-binding domain. Moreover, CIDEC stayed in the ER under lipid-deficient conditions and translocated to LDs under fatty acid stimulation suggesting that localization of CIDEC in the ER is before the LD. Our data indicated additional fatty acids stimulated hepatic CIDEC expression and an increasing level of CIDEC induced hepatic LD fusion and lipid accumulation. Our work suggests that CIDEC protects LDs by decreasing the SSA of LDs and is involved in the regulation of hepatic lipid deposition.
The Transient Receptor Potential Melastatin 2 (TRPM2) is a member of G protein coupled receptor superfamily and a novel dual-function protein that possesses both ion channel and Adenosine 5'-DiphosPhatase Ribose (ADPR) hydrolase function. TRPM2 is involved in Ca2+ signaling in various cells as an endogenous redox sensor for oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species, and contributes to cytokine production, insulin release, motility, Ca2+ entry and Ca2+-dependent cellular reactions such as endothelial hyper-permeability and apoptosis. The wide expression of TRPM2 might render it as a potentially significant therapeutic target in pathological settings including cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases and of great relevance in drug design, feed additives and other industries. Here, we discuss the TRPM2 gene structure, function, its variants, as well as its activators and inhibitors and provide a peptide drug design for modulation of oxidative stress.
McLeod syndrome and chorea-acanthocytosis are classified with the so-called neuroacanthocytosis group of syndromes. Both lead to progressive basal ganglia degeneration and were not easily distinguished in the past. With the discovery of their molecular bases, mutations of the X-linked gene XK and autosomal recessive mutations of the gene coding for chorein, respectively, the two phenotypes can now be differentiated and extend the diagnostic spectrum in patients presenting with chorea. The present review compares the two conditions and proposes a practical approach to diagnosis and treatment. Better-defined disease concepts should eventually replace the umbrella term of "neuroacanthocytosis." Animal models are needed to understand the underlying mechanisms. A final common pathway is likely for the pathogenesis of these conditions and is most probably shared with Huntington's disease.
Rat bite fever due to Streptobacillus moniliformis induces typical but not pathognomonic clinical signs, such as local purulent wound infection followed by maculopapular exanthema, myalgia as well as purulent joint infections. Severe complications, such as osteomyelitis and endocarditis are possible. it seems that this infection is rarely diagnosed but this infection could be much more common because the final diagnostic proof is difficult to achieve. Firstly, the culture of these bacteria is critical because the bacteria are fastidious and secondly the exact differentiation of the isolates is hardly possible by standard laboratory methods. Modern techniques such as mass spectroscopy (MALDI-TOF) and molecular biology allow a precise clarification. Surgical cleansing of infection sites in combination with a rational antibiotic therapy, for example with beta-lactam antibiotics, are generally able to cure the infection if treatment is started early enough. In addition, vaccinations, for example against tetanus and rabies have to be considered in this situation as for all other bite wound infections.
(S)-(-)-3-(3-(methylsulfonyl)phenyl)-1-propylpiperidine ((-)-OSU6162) is a phenylpiperidine derivative which exhibits low affinity to the dopamine D2 receptor in vitro. However, in vivo, positron emission tomography scanning studies show that the compound displaces the selective dopamine D2 receptor antagonist, raclopride. We have evaluated, in this study, the effect of (-)-OSU6162, on L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA)-induced dyskinesias in a primate model of Parkinson's disease. Five 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated cynomolgus monkeys with a stable parkinsonian syndrome and reproducible dyskinesias to L-DOPA were used in this study. The monkeys were housed in observation cages equipped with an electronic motility monitoring system. They were injected subcutaneously (s.c.) with L-DOPA methyl ester (125 mg per animal) plus benserazide (50 mg per animal; L-DOPA/benserazide) alone or in combination with (-)-OSU6162 (1.0, 3.0, 6.0 or 10 mg/kg, s.c.). Subcutaneous injection of sterile saline was used as control. L-DOPA/benserazide increased locomotion and improved parkinsonism but also induced dyskinesias. Co-administration of (-)-OSU6162 with L-DOPA/benserazide produced a significant reduction in L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias. This improvement in L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias occurred mainly at the onset of the L-DOPA/benserazide effect as reflected by an increase in the duration of the "ON" state without dyskinesias up to 3.4 fold after (-)-OSU6162 co-administration as compared to L-DOPA/benserazide alone. The anti-dyskinetic effect of (-)-OSU6162 was maintained during 14 days and no tolerance to this effect was observed. Our data suggests that (-)-OSU6162 could be of significant clinical value to reduce L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias in fluctuating advanced Parkinson's disease patients.
The cardiovascular system is an important target for thyroid hormones. The present study evaluates the changes affecting thyroid hormone metabolism during and 6 days after coronary artery bypass and their relationship with the post-operative outcome of the patients. Thirty-three patients were enrolled in the study; their thyroid hormone profiles were determined at 13 sampling points during surgery and for 6 days afterwards. Serum total tri-iodothyronine (T3) and free T3 (FT3) concentrations decreased significantly after surgery (P<0.001) and they remained significantly low until the end of the study. Free thyroxine (FT4) and T4 declined significantly immediately after surgery (P<0.05 for FT4, P<0.001 for T4) but they returned to baseline values (24 h and 96 h post-surgery respectively). Serum reverse T3 increased remarkably 36 h after surgery (P<0.001) and remained significantly higher than the baseline value throughout the study. A relevant finding was that the days of post-operative hospitalization (10+/-3 days, means+/-S.D.) was inversely correlated with the slope of the recovery of T3 concentration (P<0.001) or with the area under the plasma curves of T3 (P=0.024, time range 72-144 h) and the FT3/FT4 ratio (P=0.037, time range 72-144 h) during the post-operative period. Our data suggest a prolonged reduction of T4 to T3 conversion in patients undergoing cardiac surgery and indicate that the recovery period is the most critical in the evaluation of a possibly successful approach for T3 substitutive therapy.
Syndromes of delusional misidentification consist of disordered familiarity and have been reported in diverse diagnoses, including Parkinson's disease. Although the most common delusional misidentification is Capgras syndrome, in which the sufferer believes a familiar person has been replaced by an identical imposter, other forms have been also described. The pathogenesis of delusions of misidentification appears to require dysfunction of or connection to a left cerebral cortical area involved in recognition of familiarity, and also right frontal cortex serving belief evaluation. Two cases of Parkinson's disease with an unusual delusional misidentification, intermetamorphosis, are presented, along with their improvement with pimavanserin, a novel atypical antipsychotic medication.

Capnocytophaga species are gram-negative bacilli that inhabit mammalian oral surfaces and can cause opportunistic infection, especially in asplenic patients. The species Capnocytophaga canimorsus is particularly associated with dog bites and is known to cause endocarditis, meningitis, and sepsis in the general population. In pregnant patients, infections tied to Capnocytophaga species from human flora have been associated with preterm labor, chorioamnionitis, and neonatal septicemia. There is little known about the effects of zoonotically-acquired Capnocytophaga infection in pregnant patients. In this case report, we present a patient with Capnocytophaga bacteremia acquired after a dog bite associated with profound thrombocytopenia and preterm labor. Dog bites are common in the United States, and we present basic recommendations for management of dog bites in pregnant patients in order to avoid morbidity associated with delay in time to antibiotic treatment of infection as described in this case.
INTRODUCTION: Both non-Group A streptococcal (non-GAS) pharyngitis and Group A streptococcal (GAS) pharyngitis are commonly found in patients with sore throat. It is not known whether or not they present with similar signs and symptoms compared to patients with non-streptococcal pharyngitis.METHODS: MEDLINE was searched for prospective studies that reported throat culture for both GAS and non-GAS as a reference standard, and reported at least one sign, symptom, or the Centor score. Summary estimates of sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratios (LR+ and LR-), and diagnostic odds ratios (DOR) were calculated using a bivariate random effects model. Summary receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were created for key signs and symptoms.RESULTS: Eight studies met our inclusion criteria. Tonsillar exudate had the highest LR+ for both GAS and non-GAS pharyngitis (1.53 versus 1.71). The confidence intervals of sensitivity, LR+, LR-, and DOR for all signs, symptoms, and the Centor score between two groups overlapped, with the relative difference between sensitivities within 15% for arthralgia or myalgia, fever, injected throat, tonsillar enlargement, and tonsillar exudate. Larger differences in sensitivities were observed for sore throat, cervical adenopathy, and lack of a cough, although the difference for lack of a cough largely due to a single outlier.DISCUSSION: Signs and symptoms of patients with GAS and non-GAS pharyngitis are generally similar. No signs or symptoms clearly distinguish GAS from non-GAS infection. Further work is needed to determine whether Group C streptococcus is a pathogen that should be treated.
Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is a triad of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute renal failure. HUS is classified as either diarrhea associated, most commonly caused by infection with Escherichia coli O157, or the less common atypical HUS (aHUS), which may be familial or sporadic. Approximately 50% of patients with aHUS have mutations in one of the complement control proteins: factor H, factor I, or membrane cofactor protein (MCP). These proteins regulate complement activation through cofactor activity, the inactivation of C3b by limited proteolytic cleavage, a desirable event in the fluid phase (no target) or on healthy self-tissue (wrong target). Complement activation follows the endothelial cell injury that characterizes HUS. This disease represents a model of what takes place when inappropriate complement activation occurs on self-tissues due to the presence of mutated complement regulatory proteins. Screening for mutations in factor H, factor I, or MCP is expensive and time consuming. One approach is to perform antigenic screening for factor H and factor I deficiency and to look for low levels of MCP (CD46) expression by flow cytometry. Complement regulatory protein deficiency impacts treatment decisions as patients with aHUS have a recurrence rate in renal transplants of approximately 50%, whereas those with factor H mutations have an even higher risk (approximately 80%). By contrast, MCP deficiency can be corrected in part by a renal allograft. However, caution in the use of live-related donations is needed because of the high rates of incomplete penetrance of the described mutations.
In Drosophila, neurons and glial cells are produced by neural precursor cells called neuroblasts (NBs), which can be individually identified. Each NB generates a characteristic cell lineage specified by a precise spatiotemporal control of gene expression within the NB and its progeny. Here we show that the homeobox genes ladybird early and ladybird late are expressed in subsets of cells deriving from neuroblasts NB 5-3 and NB 5-6 and are essential for their correct development. Our analysis revealed that ladybird in Drosophila, like their vertebrate orthologous Lbx1 genes, play an important role in cell fate specification processes. Among those cells that express ladybird are NB 5-6-derived glial cells. In ladybird loss-of-function mutants, the NB 5-6-derived exit glial cells are absent while overexpression of these genes leads to supernumerary glial cells of this type. Furthermore, aberrant glial cell positioning and aberrant spacing of axonal fascicles in the nerve roots observed in embryos with altered ladybird function suggest that the ladybird genes might also control directed cell movements and cell-cell interactions within the developing Drosophila ventral nerve cord.
In addition to polynucleotide polymerization, DNA polymerases and bacterial RNA polymerase can also remove nucleotides from the growing end of nucleic acid chains. For DNA polymerases this activity is an important factor in establishing fidelity in DNA synthesis. This report describes a novel in vitro activity of RNA polymerase II whereby it cleaves an RNA chain contained within an active elongation complex. These elongation complexes are arrested at a previously identified, naturally occurring transcriptional pause site in a human gene. The new 3'-end revealed by this cleavage remains associated with an active elongation complex and is capable of being extended by RNA polymerase II. Nascent RNA cleavage is evident after removal of free nucleotides and is dependent upon a divalent metal cation and transcription elongation factor SII. This function of SII could be important in its function as an activator of transcription elongation. It is also possible that the transcript cleavage activity of RNA polymerase II represents a proofreading function of the enzyme.
BACKGROUND: Children treated with cranial radiotherapy (CRT) for leukemia are at risk of developing central nervous system injuries. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) represents the examination method of choice for evaluating radiation-induced brain complications. The purpose of this report is to describe the spectrum of MRI abnormalities detected in a group of survivors of leukemia treated with cranial irradiation.PROCEDURES: In this cross-sectional, single center study, 56 patients (median age at follow-up 19 years) receiving CRT as cranial prophylaxis (CP) included in the leukemia protocol (total dose 1,800-2,400 cGy) and/or in the total body irradiation regimen (990-1,200 cGy) before hematopoietic stem cell transplant, were evaluated by MRI after a median interval of 11 years (range 2-27) following CRT.RESULTS: Fifty-nine MRI abnormalities (32 cavernomas, nine focal areas of gliosis, seven dystrophic mineralizations, five cerebral atrophies, four pituitary atrophies, one diffuse radiation leukoencephalopathy, and one meningioma) were found in 43 patients. The longest interval between CRT and MRI and oldest age at follow-up represented the two risk factors that were statistically associated with MRI lesions (P = 0.032 and 0.033, respectively). Cerebral cavernomas (CC) were the most frequent MRI abnormalities (57%). All patients with CC were asymptomatic at diagnosis and during follow-up, except one who had aspecific neurological manifestations and micro hemorrhages.CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm that total doses and modalities of fractionation dose of CRT were not significantly associated with MRI abnormalities. Moreover, in our experience none of the patients developed neurological symptoms related to MRI abnormalities, and furthermore, the CC remained substantially stable during follow-up.
Exercise-induced oxidative stress is implicated in muscle damage and fatigue which has led athletes to embark on antioxidant supplementation regimes to negate these effects. This study investigated the intake of vitamin C (VC) (1 g), blackcurrant (BC) juice (15 mg VC, 300 mg anthocyanins) and placebo in isocaloric drink form on training progression, incremental running test and 5-km time-trial performance. Twenty-three trained female runners (age, 31 ± 8 y; mean ± SD) completed three blocks of high-intensity training for 3 wks and 3 days, separated by a washout (~3.7 wks). Changes in training and performance with each treatment were analysed with a mixed linear model, adjusting for performance at the beginning of each training block. Markers of oxidative status included protein carbonyl, malondialdehyde (in plasma and in vitro erythrocytes), ascorbic acid, uric acid and erythrocyte enzyme activity of superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase were analysed. There was a likely harmful effect on mean running speed during training when taking VC (1.3%; 90% confidence limits ±1.3%). Effects of the two treatments relative to placebo on mean performance in the incremental test and time trial were unclear, but runners faster by 1 SD of peak speed demonstrated a possible improvement on peak running speed with BC juice (1.9%; ±2.5%). Following VC, certain oxidative markers were elevated: catalase at rest (23%; ±21%), protein carbonyls at rest (27%; ±38%) and superoxide dismutase post-exercise (8.3%; ±9.3%). In conclusion, athletes should be cautioned about taking VC chronically, however, BC may improve performance in the elite.
Exencephaly is said to precede anencephaly resulting from failure of the rostral neuropore closure. In order to verify if the exencephaly induced after neural tube closure would also lead to anencephaly, exencephaly was induced in rat fetuses by maternal administration of a single dose (15 mg/kg) of cyclophosphamide on day 12 of gestation and pregnancy was prolonged by uterine ligation until postconception (PC) day 24. Fetal death was found to increase with prolongation of gestation and no sign of recovery from growth retardation was observed. Alizarin red-S-stained skeletal preparations substantiated the persistence of skull malformations in the exencephalic fetuses. Histological observations of the mesenchyme and the brain indicated degenerative changes that were intensifying with time. The ventricular system expanded progressively; the ependyma was denuded and neural mass lay free in the ventricle. The choroid plexus appeared to be elaborate and extensive. The haemorrhagic capillary network around the brain tissue was highly proliferative and appeared to penetrate the former from the exterior. Tissue necrosis seemed to progress unabated. Cystic spaces appeared beneath the base of the brain and became progressively large and it appeared as if the brain was being pushed out of the shallow cranial fossae. By PC day 24, most of the brain tissue had degenerated, thus giving clearly the appearance of the anencephalic condition.
OBJECTIVE: Charcot-Marie Tooth disease (CMT) forms a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of disorders. Although a number of disease genes have been identified for CMT, the gene discovery for some complex form of CMT has lagged behind. The association of neuropathy and optic atrophy (also known as CMT type 6) has been described with autosomaldominant, recessive and X-linked modes of inheritance. Mutations in Mitofusin 2 have been found to cause dominant forms of CMT6. Phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase-I mutations cause X-linked CMT6, but until now, mutations in the recessive forms of disease have never been identified.METHODS: We here describe a family with three affected individuals who inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion a childhood onset neuropathy and optic atrophy. Using homozygosity mapping in the family and exome sequencing in two affected individuals we identified a novel protein-truncating mutation in the C12orf65 gene, which encodes for a protein involved in mitochondrial translation. Using a variety of methods we investigated the possibility of mitochondrial impairment in the patients cell lines.RESULTS: We described a large consanguineous family with neuropathy and optic atrophy carrying a loss of function mutation in the C12orf65 gene. We report mitochondrial impairment in the patients cell lines, followed by multiple lines of evidence which include decrease of complex V activity and stability (blue native gel assay), decrease in mitochondrial respiration rate and reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential.CONCLUSIONS: This work describes a mutation in the C12orf65 gene that causes recessive form of CMT6 and confirms the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in this complex axonal neuropathy.
The level and turnover of phosphoinositides (PIs) are tightly controlled by a large set of PI-specific enzymes (PI kinases and phosphatases). Mammalian PI phosphatases are conserved through evolution and among this large family the dual-specificity phosphatase (PTP/DSP) are metal-independent enzymes displaying the amino acid signature Cys-X5-Arg-Thr/Ser (CX5RT/S) in their active site. Such catalytic site characterizes the myotubularin 3-phosphatases that dephosphorylate PtdIns3P and PtdIns(3,5)P₂ and produce PtdIns5P. Substrates of myotubularins have been implicated in endocytosis and membrane trafficking while PtdIns5P may have a role in signal transduction. As a paradox, 6 of the 14 members of the myotubularin family lack enzymatic activity and are considered as dead phosphatases. Several myotubularins have been genetically linked to human diseases: MTM1 is mutated in the congenital myopathy X-linked centronuclear or myotubular myopathy (XLCNM) and MTMR14 (JUMPY) has been linked to an autosomal form of such disease, while MTMR2 and MTMR13 are mutated in Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) neuropathies. Furthermore, recent evidences from genetic association studies revealed that several other myotubularins could be associated to chronic disorders such as cancer and obesity, highlighting their importance for human health. Here, we discuss cellular and physiological roles of myotubularins and their implication in human diseases, and we present potential pathological mechanisms affecting specific tissues in myotubularin-associated diseases.
Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is a heritable human disorder characterized by defects in nucleotide excision repair (NER) and the development of skin cancer. Cells from XP group E (XP-E) patients have a defect in the UV-damaged DNA-binding protein complex (UV-DDB), involved in the damage recognition step of NER. UV-DDB comprises two subunits, products of the DDB1 and DDB2 genes, respectively. Mutations in the DDB2 gene account for the underlying defect in XP-E. The UV-DDB complex is a component of the newly identified cullin 4A-based ubiquitin E3 ligase, DDB1-CUL4A(DDB2). The E3 ubiquitin ligases recognize specific substrates and mediate their ubiquitination to regulate protein activity or target proteins for degradation by the proteasomal pathway. In this study, we have addressed the role of the UV-DDB-based E3 in NER and sought a physiological substrate. We demonstrate that monoubiquitinated histone H2A in native chromatin coimmunoprecipitates with the endogenous DDB1-CUL4A(DDB2) complex in response to UV irradiation. Further, mutations in DDB2 alter the formation and binding activity of the DDB1-CUL4A(DDB2) ligase, accompanied by impaired monoubiquitination of H2A after UV treatment of XP-E cells, compared with repair-proficient cells. This finding indicates that DDB2, as the substrate receptor of the DDB1-CUL4A-based ligase, specifically targets histone H2A for monoubiquitination in a photolesion-binding-dependent manner. Given that the loss of monoubiquitinated histone H2A at the sites of UV-damaged DNA is associated with decreased global genome repair in XP-E cells, this study suggests that histone modification, mediated by the XPE factor, facilitates the initiation of NER.
BACKGROUND: Protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) and its derivatives are widely used in photodynamic therapy (PDT) to kill cancer cells. Studies showed that the application of these drugs could cause systemic toxic effects in human. However, the molecular pathways involved in PpIX-induced cytotoxicity are not well-defined. Macrophages represent the primary system for protecting tissues from toxicants and initiating the resolution of inflammation. Thus, this study aims to investigate the toxicity of PpIX on macrophages and provide strategies to prevent the toxic effects.METHODS: THP-1 macrophages were incubated with PpIX and cell death was measured by MTT assay and Annexin V-PI staining. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) were evaluated by 2', 7'-Dichlorodihydrofluorescin diacetate (DCFH-DA) and MitoSOX® Red staining and mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) was detected by tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRM) staining. Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activation was assayed by western blotting. Mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening was measured by calcein loading/Co(2+) quenching technique and evaluating the release of mitochondrial content.RESULTS: PpIX reduced cell viability in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The cell death was characterized by increasing PI-positive cells, ATP depletion, LDH releasing and rapid ΔΨm loss favoring necrotic features. In addition, PpIX successively induced ROS production, c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK) activation and mPTP opening. ROS scavengers, N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and deferoxamine (DFX), JNK inhibitor, SP600125, and mPTP inhibitor, cyclosporin A (CsA), all significantly rescued this cell death. Furthermore, mPTP opening was directly regulated by ROS/JNK pathway.CONCLUSION: PpIX induces a necrotic cell death in THP-1 macrophages through ROS production, JNK activation, and mPTP opening. It is tempting to speculate that blocking the pathways involved in the cytotoxic effects of PpIX will alleviate its side effects.
BACKGROUND: Tacrine is one of the first drugs to be widely marketed for the loss of memory and intellectual decline in Alzheimer's disease, often accompanied by abnormal behaviour and physical decline. The alleged success of tacrine in the treatment of these symptoms has been heralded as confirmation of the cholinergic theory of Alzheimer's disease. The efficacy of tacrine for symptoms of dementia remains controversial. This is reflected by the low rate of prescription of tacrine in countries where it is approved and the lack of approval by several regulatory authorities in Europe and elsewhere. The uncertainty about the efficacy of tacrine is due to the difficulties in interpretation of the results from the clinical trials. The reasons for this are the small effects of tacrine compared to placebo for all outcomes; the high incidence of adverse events; the lack of benefit observed in several trials; the use of cross-over designs and their associated methodological problems in a disease like dementia; the use of different measurement scales to assess outcome in different trials; and the problem of high dropout rates.OBJECTIVES: To determine the clinical efficacy of tacrine for the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.SEARCH STRATEGY: The Cochrane Dementia Group Register of Clinical Trials was searched using the terms 'tacrine', 'tetrahydroaminoacridine' and 'THA' (see the Group's search strategy for full details).SELECTION CRITERIA: All unconfounded, double-blind, randomized trials in which treatment with tacrine was administered for more than a day and compared to placebo in patients with dementia of the Alzheimer's type.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data were extracted independently by two reviewers, pooled if appropriate and possible, and the pooled odds ratios (95%CI) or the average differences (95%CI) were estimated. Where possible, intention-to-treat data were used.MAIN RESULTS: This review produced no clear results. The results were compatible with tacrine producing improvement, no change or even harm for those with Alzheimer's disease. It was not possible to use many of the published results in a combined analysis. For measures of overall clinical improvement, the intention-to-treat analyses failed to detect any difference between tacrine and placebo (OR 0.87; 95%CI 0.61 - 1.23). Behavioural disturbance, as measured by the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-noncognitive, failed to detect any difference between tacrine and placebo (SMD -0.04; 95%CI -0.52 - 0.43). For cognition function, the effect of tacrine was not statistically significantly different from placebo for the MiniMental State Examination score (0-30; high =good) (SMD 0.14; 95%CI -0.02 - 0.30) and was barely statistically significantly in favour of treatment for the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive scale (SMD -0.22; 95%CI -0.32 - -0.13). Adverse events were not reported in a systematic way in the different trials, making formal comparison difficult. Raised serum liver enzymes was the major reason for withdrawal. The odds ratio for withdrawal due to an adverse event was significantly different from one, the control group experienced fewer events (OR 5.7; 95%CI 4.1-7.9). Gastrointestinal side effects (diarrhoea, anorexia, dyspepsia and abdominal pain) were the other major cause of adverse events and for withdrawal, and the odds ratio for withdrawal was also significantly different from one in favour of the control group (OR 3.8; 95%CI 2.8-5.1). No deaths were reported in any of the studies during the trial period, up to six months.AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This review provides no convincing evidence that tacrine is a useful treatment for the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. However, as so few trials presented data in a format suitable for pooling, the results of this review may be modified when further data from all relevant trials are included. There is an urgent need for the independent evaluation of the data already existing in the trials but not accessible through published or grouped data. An independent meta-analysis of the individual-patient data is required. The results and conclusions of this update are unaltered by further searching as the additional studies do not add any further valid/eligible data.
p16INK4a (p16) tumor-suppressor protein is a biomarker of human papillomavirus (HPV) oncogenic activity that has revealed a high rate of positivity in histological high-gade squamous intraepithelial lesion/cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 (HSIL/CIN2) lesions. However, there is a paucity of data regarding p16 status as a surrogate marker of HSIL/CIN2 evolution. The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcome of HSIL/CIN2 patients followed up without treatment for 12 months according to p16 immunohistochemical staining. Patients diagnosed with HSIL/CIN2 colposcopy-directed biopsy, were recruited prospectively between December 2011 and October 2013. p16 staining was performed in all HSIL/CIN2 diagnostic biopsies. Follow-up was conducted every 4 months by cytology, colposcopy and biopsy if suspicion of progression and once the 12 months of follow-up completed. Complete regression, partial regression, persistence, and progression rates of HSIL/CIN2 were defined as a final outcome. A total of 96 patients were included in the analysis. The rate of spontaneous regression was 64%, while 28% had persistent disease, and 8% progressed at 12 months of follow-up. p16 was positive in 81 (84%) initial HSIL/CIN2 biopsies. Regression was observed in all 15 p16 negative cases and in 46 of 81 (57%) p16 positive cases (P=0.001). In conclusion, patients with p16 negative HSIL/CIN2 biopsy had a high rate of regression during first 12 months of follow-up. Status of p16 staining could be considered for HSIL/CIN2 management.
The development of new anticancer agents derived from natural resources requires a rapid identification of their molecular mechanism of action. To make this step short, we have initiated the proteomic profiling of HeLa cells treated with anticancer drugs representing a wide spectrum of mechanisms of action using two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE). Unique proteome patterns were observed in HeLa cells treated with the HSP90 inhibitor geldanamycin, and were similar to the patterns induced by radicicol, a structurally different HSP90 inhibitor. On the other hand, etoposide and ICRF-193, compounds claimed to be topoisomerase II inhibitors, showed different proteomic profiles, which reflect their different biological activities as revealed by cell-cycle analysis. Thus far, combined data from 19 compounds have allowed their successful classification by cluster analysis according to the mechanism of action.
The COP9 signalosome (CSN) is a multiprotein complex that was initially identified in plants as a repressor of photomorphogenesis. It is now known to play major roles in several other developmental pathways, from auxin response to flower development. Furthermore, the COP9 signalosome shares homologies with the lid sibcomplex of the proteasome and is evolutionarily conserved from fission yeast to humans. It is important for the proper development of virtually all higher eukaryotes. In recent years, significant progress has been made in unraveling the molecular, cellular, and physiological mode of action of the COP9 signalosome. This review discusses our current understanding of the COP9 signalosome function with particular emphasis on its recently defined role in modulating a wide variety of cellular processes by regulating specific protein degradation events.
A follow-up over 83 generations has been carried out, by the Southern blotting technique, of a Drosophila stock which is unstable in the location of Bari 1 elements. The persistent intrastock polymorphism detected is largely amenable to insertion/excision equilibria at 36 genomic sites that form a gradient in occupancy. In a closely related stock, Bari 1 elements are stable and exhibit a substantially different genomic distribution. These results suggest that in Drosophila preferential insertion sites may be defined with the contribution of host factors, although alternative interpretations are also possible. The relevance to the mechanism(s) that contains the potentially deleterious effects of transposition is discussed.
CONTEXT: The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued warnings that use of antidepressant medications poses a small but significantly increased risk of suicidal ideation/suicide attempt for children and adolescents.OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and risk of reported suicidal ideation/suicide attempt of antidepressants for treatment of pediatric major depressive disorder (MDD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and non-OCD anxiety disorders.DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SELECTION: PubMed (1988 to July 2006), relevant US and British regulatory agency reports, published abstracts of important scientific meetings (1998-2006), clinical trial registries, and information from authors. Studies were published and unpublished randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trials of second-generation antidepressants (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, nefazodone, venlafaxine, and mirtazapine) in participants younger than 19 years with MDD, OCD, or non-OCD anxiety disorders.DATA EXTRACTION: Information was extracted on study characteristics, efficacy outcomes, and spontaneously reported suicidal ideation/suicide attempt.DATA SYNTHESIS: Twenty-seven trials of pediatric MDD (n = 15), OCD (n = 6), and non-OCD anxiety disorders (n = 6) were selected, and risk differences for response and for suicidal ideation/suicide attempt estimated by random-effects methods. Pooled risk differences in rates of primary study-defined measures of responder status significantly favored antidepressants for MDD (11.0%; [95% confidence interval {CI}, 7.1% to 14.9%]), OCD (19.8% [95% CI, 13.0% to 26.6%), and non-OCD anxiety disorders (37.1% [22.5% to 51.7%]), corresponding to a number needed to treat (NNT) of 10 (95% CI, 7 to 15), 6 (4 to 8), and 3 (2 to 5), respectively. While there was increased risk difference of suicidal ideation/suicide attempt across all trials and indications for drug vs placebo (0.7%; 95% CI, 0.1% to 1.3%) (number needed to harm, 143 [95% CI, 77 to 1000]), the pooled risk differences within each indication were not statistically significant: 0.9% (95% CI, -0.1% to 1.9%) for MDD, 0.5% (-1.2% to 2.2%) for OCD, and 0.7% (-0.4% to 1.8%) for non-OCD anxiety disorders. There were no completed suicides. Age-stratified analyses showed that for children younger than 12 years with MDD, only fluoxetine showed benefit over placebo. In MDD trials, efficacy was moderated by age, duration of depression, and number of sites in the treatment trial.CONCLUSIONS: Relative to placebo, antidepressants are efficacious for pediatric MDD, OCD, and non-OCD anxiety disorders, although the effects are strongest in non-OCD anxiety disorders, intermediate in OCD, and more modest in MDD. Benefits of antidepressants appear to be much greater than risks from suicidal ideation/suicide attempt across indications, although comparison of benefit to risk varies as a function of indication, age, chronicity, and study conditions.
The introduction of biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (bDMARD) treatments for various types of autoimmune arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthropathy and ankylosing spondylitis, represents a new era of treatment for patients with a refractory response to conventional synthetic DMARDs (csDMARDs). Many new bDMARDs with different modalities or that target different pro-inflammatory molecules, likely cytokines, are rapidly emerging. Hence, physicians in the field may be confused about choosing appropriate bDMARDs for their patients. Considering the high cost of bDMARDs and the rapid destructive process of autoimmune arthritis in patients, the choice of optimal bDMARDs for patients who fail to respond or show an inadequate therapeutic response to csDMARDs designed to control the disease is very critical. Here, we summarize the strengths and weaknesses of bDMARDs and specifically focus on their uses in patients with comorbid conditions or with specific medical conditions, such as pregnancy. This commentary provides a solid up-to-date review on commercially available bDMARDs and very useful information for physicians to facilitate the choice of more appropriate bDMARDs to treat patients with autoimmune arthritis and for basic researchers to understand the current strategies of bDMARD usage and hopefully to develop more powerful bDMARDs with fewer safety concerns.
BACKGROUND: In this study the total and phosphorylated amount of epidermal growth factor receptor 1 (EGFR) and 2 (HER2) were measured together with EGFR ligands in tissue samples of breast cancer patients in order to investigate interrelations and possible prognostic values.METHODS: Samples of malignant and non-cancer autologous reference tissue were collected from 415 breast cancer patients. The tissue samples were cut and either paraffin-embedded or homogenized in a lysis buffer to extract the proteins. HER2 was measured using both immunohistochemistry (IHC)/fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and ADVIA Centaur. Phosphorylated HER2 and EGFR (pHER2, pEGFR), total EGFR and the ligands: epidermal growth factor (EGF), transforming growth factor-α (TGFα), amphiregulin (AREG), heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF), betacellulin (BTC) and epiregulin (EREG) were measured using the Luminex.RESULTS: The HER2 positivity rate was determined to be 25.2% by the Centaur method vs. 15.8% by IHC and FISH. HER2, HB-EGF, TGFα and AREG were upregulated in cancer tissue as compared with autologous reference tissue while EGFR, pEGFR and EGF were downregulated (p<10-6). pEGFR in autologous reference tissue was negatively correlated to the number of positive lymph nodes and to the tumor size (p=0.0007 and p=0.001, respectively) and furthermore, decreased in the group of mastectomy operated patients as compared with the lumpectomy group (p<10-6). HB-EGF in cancer tissue was positively associated with high grade tumors (p<10-6) and pHER2, HB-EGF and BTC were associated with poor disease free survival (p=0.017, p=0.012 and p=0.0026, respectively).CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated a profound activation of the EGFR system. HB-EGF was increased by factor 10 in cancer tissue and related to the biological aggressiveness of the tumors, and pHER2, HB-EGF and BTC were associated with poor clinical outcome.
Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are long, non-coding RNAs that result from the non-canonical splicing of linear pre-mRNAs. However, the characteristics and the critical role of circRNA in co-/post-transcriptional regulation were not well recognized until the "microRNA sponge" function of circRNA is discovered. Recent studies have mainly been devoted to the function of the circular RNA sponge for miR-7 (ciRS-7) and sex-determining region Y (SRY) by targeting microRNA-7 (miR-7) and microRNA-138 (miR-138), respectively. In this review, we illustrate the specific role of circRNAs in a wide variety of cancers and in regulating the biological behavior of cancers via miR-7 or miR-138 regulation. Furthermore, circRNA, together with its gene silencing ability, also shows its potential in RNA interference (RNAi) therapy by binding to target RNAs, which provides a novel perspective in cancer treatment. Thus, this review concerns the biogenesis, biological function, oncogenesis, progression and possible therapies for cancer involving circRNAs.
BACKGROUND: Deletions or inactivating mutations of the cystinosin gene CTNS lead to cystine accumulation and crystals at acidic pH in patients with nephropathic cystinosis, a rare lysosomal storage disease and the main cause of hereditary renal Fanconi syndrome. Early use of oral cysteamine to prevent cystine accumulation slows progression of nephropathic cystinosis but it is a demanding treatment and not a cure. The source of cystine accumulating in kidney proximal tubular cells and cystine's role in disease progression are unknown.METHODS: To investigate whether receptor-mediated endocytosis by the megalin/LRP2 pathway of ultrafiltrated, disulfide-rich plasma proteins could be a source of cystine in proximal tubular cells, we used a mouse model of cystinosis in which conditional excision of floxed megalin/LRP2 alleles in proximal tubular cells of cystinotic mice was achieved by a Cre-LoxP strategy using Wnt4-CRE. We evaluated mice aged 6-9 months for kidney cystine levels and crystals; histopathology, with emphasis on swan-neck lesions and proximal-tubular-cell apoptosis and proliferation (turnover); and proximal-tubular-cell expression of the major apical transporters sodium-phosphate cotransporter 2A (NaPi-IIa) and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2).RESULTS: Wnt4-CRE-driven megalin/LRP2 ablation in cystinotic mice efficiently blocked kidney cystine accumulation, thereby preventing lysosomal deformations and crystal deposition in proximal tubular cells. Swan-neck lesions were largely prevented and proximal-tubular-cell turnover was normalized. Apical expression of the two cotransporters was also preserved.CONCLUSIONS: These observations support a key role of the megalin/LRP2 pathway in the progression of nephropathic cystinosis and provide a proof of concept for the pathway as a therapeutic target.
Mutations in the OPA1 gene are associated with autosomal dominant optic atrophy. OPA1 encodes a dynamin-related protein orthologous to Msp1 of Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Mgm1p of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, both involved in mitochondrial morphology and genome maintenance. We present immuno-fluorescence and biochemical evidences showing that OPA1 resides in the mitochondria where it is imported through its highly basic amino-terminal extension. Proteolysis experiments indicate that OPA1 is present in the inter-membrane space and electron microscopy further localizes it close to the cristae. The strong association of OPA1 with membranes suggests its anchoring to the inner membrane.
BACKGROUND: The moss Physcomitrella patens is an emerging plant model system due to its high rate of homologous recombination, haploidy, simple body plan, physiological properties as well as phylogenetic position. Available EST data was clustered and assembled, and provided the basis for a genome-wide analysis of protein encoding genes.RESULTS: We have clustered and assembled Physcomitrella patens EST and CDS data in order to represent the transcriptome of this non-seed plant. Clustering of the publicly available data and subsequent prediction resulted in a total of 19,081 non-redundant ORF. Of these putative transcripts, approximately 30% have a homolog in both rice and Arabidopsis transcriptome. More than 130 transcripts are not present in seed plants but can be found in other kingdoms. These potential "retained genes" might have been lost during seed plant evolution. Functional annotation of these genes reveals unequal distribution among taxonomic groups and intriguing putative functions such as cytotoxicity and nucleic acid repair. Whereas introns in the moss are larger on average than in the seed plant Arabidopsis thaliana, position and amount of introns are approximately the same. Contrary to Arabidopsis, where CDS contain on average 44% G/C, in Physcomitrella the average G/C content is 50%. Interestingly, moss orthologs of Arabidopsis genes show a significant drift of codon fraction usage, towards the seed plant. While averaged codon bias is the same in Physcomitrella and Arabidopsis, the distribution pattern is different, with 15% of moss genes being unbiased. Species-specific, sensitive and selective splice site prediction for Physcomitrella has been developed using a dataset of 368 donor and acceptor sites, utilizing a support vector machine. The prediction accuracy is better than those achieved with tools trained on Arabidopsis data.CONCLUSION: Analysis of the moss transcriptome displays differences in gene structure, codon and splice site usage in comparison with the seed plant Arabidopsis. Putative retained genes exhibit possible functions that might explain the peculiar physiological properties of mosses. Both the transcriptome representation (including a BLAST and retrieval service) and splice site prediction have been made available on http://www.cosmoss.org, setting the basis for assembly and annotation of the Physcomitrella genome, of which draft shotgun sequences will become available in 2005.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the pharmacokinetic equivalence of a new soft capsule formulation of levothyroxine versus a marketed reference product and to assess the soft capsule formulated with stricter potency guidelines versus the capsule before the implementation of the new potency rule.METHOD: Two single-dose randomized two-way crossover pharmacokinetic equivalence studies and one dosage form proportionality single-dose study comparing low, medium, and high strengths of the new formulation. All three studies were performed in a clinical setting. Participants were healthy male and female adult subjects with normal levothyroxine levels. A total of 90 subjects participated in the three studies.RESULTS: Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated on baseline- adjusted concentrations. The first pharmacokinetic equivalence study compared the levothyroxine sodium soft capsule formulation (Tirosint) with the reference Synthroid tablets and the two products were considered bioequivalent. The dosage form proportionality study compared the 50-, 100-, and 150-μg test capsules strengths dosed at the same level (600 μg) and all three strengths were considered equivalent when given at the same dosage. The last study compared the test capsule used in the first two studies with a new capsule formulation following the new potency guideline (±5%) set forward by the Food and Drug Administration and the two capsules were considered bioequivalent. Doses were well tolerated by subjects in all three studies with no serious adverse events reported.CONCLUSIONS: The levothyroxine soft capsule formulated with the stricter new potency guideline set forward by the Food and Drug Administration met equivalence criteria in terms of rate and extent of exposure under fasting conditions to the reference tablet formulation. Clinical doses of the capsule formulation can be given using any combination of the commercialized strengths.
Aortitis is typically a chronic, progressive disease manifestation associated with large vessel vasculitidies, most notably giant cell, Takayasu arteritis, and a newly described entity, isolated aortitis. The aortitis may lead to aneurysm formation and symptoms associated with branch vessel occlusion in these diseases, but aortic dissection is rare and usually a late complication of smoldering, incompletely treated disease. We present a case of aortitis in a previously healthy 39-year-old man who succumbed to aortic dissection hours after the onset of symptoms. No aneurysm or fibrosis was found on postmortem examination. The inflammation was characterized by disruption of the media with patchy transmural chronic and focally acute inflammatory infiltrate. We review case reports of other individuals with aortitis, who initially or very early in their course presented with aortic dissection in the absence of known rheumatic disease and most without evidence of aneurysm formation. We believe that this represents a process characterized by an aggressive vasculitis of the aorta with its own clinical features, a fulminant variety of isolated aortitis.
Cohesin is a ring-shaped protein complex that plays a crucial role in sister chromatid cohesion and gene expression. The dynamic association of cohesin with chromatin is essential for these functions. However, the exact nature of cohesin dynamics, particularly cohesin translocation, remains unclear. We evaluated the dynamics of individual cohesin molecules on DNA and found that the cohesin core complex possesses an intrinsic ability to traverse DNA in an adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase)-dependent manner. Translocation ability is suppressed in the presence of Wapl-Pds5 and Sororin; this suppression is alleviated by the acetylation of cohesin and the action of mitotic kinases. In Xenopus laevis egg extracts, cohesin is translocated on unreplicated DNA in an ATPase- and Smc3 acetylation-dependent manner. Cohesin movement changes from bidirectional to unidirectional when cohesin faces DNA replication; otherwise, it is incorporated into replicating DNA without being translocated or is dissociated from replicating DNA This study provides insight into the nature of individual cohesin dynamics and the mechanisms by which cohesin achieves cohesion in different chromatin contexts.
Most previously reported mutations in cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) result in an odd number of cysteine residues within the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats in Notch3. We report here R75P mutation in two Japanese CADASIL families not directly involving cysteine residues located within the first EGF-like repeats. Probands in both families had repeated episodes of stroke, depression, dementia as well as T2 high-intensity lesions in the basal ganglia and periventricular white matter, but fewer white matter lesions in the temporal pole on MRI. These families provide new insights into the diagnosis and pathomechanisms of CADASIL.
The clinical manifestations of drug eruptions can range from mild maculopapular exanthema to severe cutaneous adverse drug reactions (SCAR), including drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome/drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) which are rare but occasionally fatal. Some pathogens may induce skin reactions mimicking SCAR. There are several models to explain the interaction of human leukocyte antigen (HLA), drug and T-cell receptor (TCR): (i) the "hapten/prohapten" theory; (ii) the "p-i concept"; (iii) the "altered peptide repertoire"; and (iv) the "altered TCR repertoire". The checkpoints of molecular mechanisms of SCAR include specific drug antigens interacting with the specific HLA loci (e.g. HLA-B*15:02 for carbamazepine-induced SJS/TEN and HLA-B*58:01 for allopurinol-induced SCAR), involvement of specific TCR, induction of T-cell-mediated responses (e.g. granulysin, Fas ligand, perforin/granzyme B and T-helper 1/2-associated cytokines) and cell death mechanism (e.g. miR-18a-5p-induced apoptosis; annexin A1 and formyl peptide receptor 1-induced necroptosis in keratinocytes). In addition to immune mechanism, metabolism has been found to play a role in the pathogenesis of SCAR, such as recent findings of strong association of CYP2C9*3 with phenytoin-induced SCAR and impaired renal function with allopurinol SCAR. With a better understanding of the mechanisms, effective therapeutics and prevention for SCAR can be improved.
Eukaryotic histones serve as prototypical examples of posttranslational complexity with diverse modifications (PTMs) on many different residues that comprise a "Histone Code". To help crack this code more efficiently, we demonstrate a new strategy for protein characterization wherein complete PTM descriptions are obtained by database retrieval instead of manual interpretation of information-rich data from high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). A database of nearly 50 000 modified histone H4 sequences was created and queried with 91 fragment ions from electron capture dissociation of a histone form +112 Da (versus unmodified mass) selectively accumulated in a quadrupole Fourier transform hybrid mass spectrometer. The correct form atop the retrieval list indicated dimethylation at Lys20, acetylation at the N terminus, and acetylation at Lys16 (resolved from trimethylation, Deltam = 0.036 Da). A statistical evaluation reveals the critical role of mass accuracy and that PTM "isomers" are retrieved as next-best matches. The applicability of shotgun annotation to forms of H4 with up to six PTMs is demonstrated, with extensibility to other histones (e.g., H2A, H2B, H3) and other protein classes projected.
Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) consists of the pentad of thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, fever, neurologic abnormalities, and renal disease. We present a case report of acute TTP following a bout of ischemic colitis. This report reminds the clinician that ischemic colitis can be an atypical presentation of TTP. The prompt recognition and treatment of this disease process resulted in a good prognosis for our patient.
OBJECTIVE: To compare colonic microbial composition in systemic sclerosis (SSc) patients and healthy controls and to determine whether certain microbial genera are associated with gastrointestinal (GI) tract symptoms in patients with SSc.METHODS: Healthy controls were age- and sex-matched (1:1) with adult SSc patients. Cecum and sigmoid mucosal lavage samples were obtained during colonoscopy. The microbiota in these samples were determined by Illumina HiSeq 2000 16S sequencing, and operational taxonomic units were selected. Linear discriminant analysis effect size was used to identify the genera that showed differential expression in SSc patients versus controls. Differential expression analysis for sequence count data was used to identify specific genera associated with GI tract symptoms.RESULTS: Among 17 patients with SSc (88% female; median age 52.1 years), the mean ± SD total GI Tract 2.0 score was 0.7 ± 0.6. Principal coordinate analysis illustrated significant differences in microbial communities in the cecum and sigmoid regions in SSc patients versus healthy controls (both P = 0.001). Similar to the findings in inflammatory disease states, SSc patients had decreased levels of commensal bacteria, such as Faecalibacterium and Clostridium, and increased levels of pathobiont bacteria, such as Fusobacterium and γ-Proteobacteria, compared with healthy controls. Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus, which are typically reduced under conditions of inflammation, were also increased in abundance in patients with SSc. In SSc patients with moderate/severe GI tract symptoms, the abundance of Bacteroides fragilis was decreased, and that of Fusobacterium was increased, compared with patients who had no or mild symptoms.CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates a distinct colonic microbial signature in SSc patients compared with healthy controls. This unique ecologic change may perpetuate immunologic aberrations and contribute to clinical manifestations of SSc.
OBJECTIVE: To explore what considerations patients have when deciding about disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and what information patients need to participate in the decision-making process.METHODS: In-depth face-to-face interviews were conducted with 32 patients with inflammatory arthritis who recently consulted their rheumatologist and discussed initiating DMARDs.RESULTS: Beliefs in the necessity of DMARDs, either for relief of symptoms or prevention of future joint damage, were reasons to initiate DMARDs. Furthermore, trust in the rheumatologist and the health care system was important in this respect. Patients expressed many concerns about initiating DMARDS. These related to the perceived aggressive and harmful nature of DMARDs, potential (or unknown) side effects, influence on fertility and pregnancy, combination with other medicines, time to benefit, and manner of administration. Participants also worried about the future regarding long-term medication use and drug dependency, and if a medicine proved to be ineffective, about the risks of future treatments and running out of options. To decrease uncertainty, participants wanted to be informed about multiple treatment options, both current and future. They not only wanted clinical information but also information on how the medications could affect their daily lives.CONCLUSION: Health education should inform patients about multiple treatment options, for the present as well as for the future. It should enable patients to compare treatments with regard to both clinical aspects as well as possible consequences for their daily lives.
OBJECTIVE: Early and accurate diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is important for patient care and for entry in clinical trials. Retrospective studies suggest that the use of the Awaji algorithm for the diagnosis of ALS is more sensitive for early diagnosis than the currently used revised El Escorial criteria.METHODS: We prospectively compared the revised El Escorial criteria with the Awaji algorithm in patients seen with suspected ALS at the University Hospitals Leuven between January 2008 and April 2010.RESULTS: Out of 200 patients referred for the diagnosis of ALS, 66% and 85% could be categorized to definite or probable ALS at first presentation according to the revised El Escorial and the Awaji algorithm, respectively (p < 5.6 × 10(-17) ). This corresponds to a >50% reduction of patients not eligible for clinical trial entry. Application of the Awaji algorithm made the diagnosis of ALS more likely by at least 1 diagnostic category in 25.7% of patients and identified at least 1 additional region with electrodiagnostic signs of ongoing lower motor neuron loss in 46.4% of electrodiagnostic investigations. Application of the Awaji algorithm did not result in a single false-positive diagnosis of ALS in this study.INTERPRETATION: Our data demonstrate that the Awaji algorithm is significantly more sensitive compared to the revised El Escorial criteria, without resulting in false-positive diagnoses of ALS. It should therefore be used in clinical trials.
The largest genetic risk for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) resides at the apolipoprotein E gene (APOE) locus, which has three common alleles (ɛ2, ɛ3, ɛ4) that encode three isoforms (apoE2, apoE3, apoE4). The very strong association of the APOE ɛ4 allele with AD risk and its role in the accumulation of amyloid β in brains of people and animal models solidify the biological relevance of apoE isoforms but do not provide mechanistic insight. The innate immune response is consistently observed in AD and is a likely contributor to neuronal injury and response to injury. Here we review emerging data showing that apoE isoform regulation of multiple facets of the innate immune response in the brain may alter AD not only through amyloid β-dependent mechanisms, but also through other, amyloid β-independent mechanisms.
BACKGROUND: Hemophilic pseudotumor is an unusual complication occurring in only 1% to 2% of patients with severe factor VIII or IX deficiency, and manifests as a progressive enlargement of hematoma by recurrent hemorrhage, often resulting in bone destruction or resorption due to the chronic pressure of osseous hemorrhage. Cranial hemophilic pseudotumors are extremely rare, with only 4 previous cases associated with mild or moderate factor XIII deficiency.CASE DESCRIPTION: A 24-year-old man with moderate deficiency of factor IX developed a cranial pseudotumor as a swelling in the frontal scalp. Blood coagulation profile revealed extended activated partial thromboplastin time (58.2 seconds). Factor IX analysis showed 3% of normal activity. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated an extra-axial lesion with bone destruction, enhanced rim, and signal changes consistent with chronic hemorrhage. Surgical removal was performed. Histologic examination disclosed old blood coagulum.CONCLUSIONS: This case of cranial hemophilic pseudotumor in a patient with moderate factor IX deficiency suggests that cranial pseudotumor should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cranial lesion in a patient with hemophilia, and adequate replacement therapy in the perioperative period is essential to achieve safe surgical removal.
Exosomes are nanovesicles secreted into the extracellular environment upon internal vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane. The molecular content of exosomes is a fingerprint of the releasing cell type and of its status. For this reason, and because they are released in easily accessible body fluids such as blood and urine, they represent a precious biomedical tool. A growing body of evidence suggests that exosomes may be used as biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of malignant tumors. This article focuses on the exploitation of exosomes as diagnostic tools for human tumors and discusses possible applications of the same strategies to other pathologies, such as neurodegenerative diseases.
Methylation of lysine residues in the N-terminal tails of histones is thought to represent an important component of the mechanism that regulates chromatin structure. The evolutionarily conserved SET domain occurs in most proteins known to possess histone lysine methyltransferase activity. We present here the crystal structure of a large fragment of human SET7/9 that contains a N-terminal beta-sheet domain as well as the conserved SET domain. Mutagenesis identifies two residues in the C terminus of the protein that appear essential for catalytic activity toward lysine-4 of histone H3. Furthermore, we show how the cofactor AdoMet binds to this domain and present biochemical data supporting the role of invariant residues in catalysis, binding of AdoMet, and interactions with the peptide substrate.
BACKGROUND: Analysis conducted in the Life Span Study (LSS) cohort of atomic bomb survivors in Hiroshima and Nagasaki found a significant dose-related excess of tumors of the central nervous system (CNS) and the pituitary gland. The objective of the current study was to evaluate clinical and epidemiologic characteristics of first primary tumors of the CNS and the pituitary gland in this cohort and to compare them with characteristics among other populations.METHODS: CNS and pituitary gland tumors that were diagnosed between 1958 and 1995 among 80,160 LSS cohort members were ascertained through Hiroshima and Nagasaki tumor registries, autopsy reports, and other sources. Pathologists reviewed all available records and slides to verify histologic diagnoses. Poisson regression analysis was used to model background incidence rates allowing for radiation effects.RESULTS: Meningioma was the most common tumor among clinically diagnosed tumors, followed by neuroepithelial tumor, schwannoma, and pituitary tumor. The overall incidence of these tumors increased initially with age but declined among the elderly. For all age groups and for both genders, incidence increased over time. By contrast, when tumors diagnosed at autopsy were included, incidence rose continuously with age and was stable over time.CONCLUSIONS: The main characteristics of CNS and pituitary gland tumors diagnosed in the LSS cohort were consistent with the characteristics of "spontaneous" tumors observed in other population-based studies. The predominance of meningiomas over neuroepithelial tumors in the Japanese population was noteworthy and warrants further investigation. The secular rise in incidence of all clinically diagnosed CNS and pituitary gland tumors is most likely to be attributable to the increased use of new imaging techniques.
Publisher: Los abejorros están constantemente expuestos a una amplia gama de agentes estresantes bióticos y abióticos de los que deben defenderse para sobrevivir. Los patógenos y los pesticidas son importantes factores estresantes que influyen en la salud de los abejorros, tanto cuando actúan solos como en combinación. Para tener un mejor conocimiento sobre la salud de los abejorros, debemos investigar cómo interactúan estos factores estresantes, pero los estudios experimentales hasta la fecha generalmente se centran en estudiar solo uno o dos factores. El objetivo de nuestro estudio es evaluar cómo los efectos combinados de cuatro importantes factores estresantes (el parásito intestinal Nosema ceranae, el insecticida neonicotinoide tiametoxam, el insecticida piretroide cipermetrina y el fungicida EBI tebuconazol) interactúan para afectar a los abejorros a nivel individual y de colonia. Establecimos siete grupos de tratamiento de colonias de abejorros que expusimos a diferentes combinaciones de estos factores estresantes durante dos semanas en condiciones de laboratorio, y posteriormente se colocaron en el campo durante siete semanas, para evaluar el efecto de los tratamientos sobre la prevalencia de N. ceranae en abejorros inoculados, los niveles de expresión de genes relacionados con la inmunidad y la desintoxicación, la recolección de alimentos, el aumento de peso, el número de obreras y machos, y la producción de cría de obreras, machos y reinas. La exposición a mezclas de pesticidas redujo la recolección de alimentos por parte de los abejorros. Todos los genes relacionados con la inmunidad se sobre-expresaron en los abejorros inoculados con N. ceranae cuando no habían estado expuestos a mezclas de pesticidas, y los abejorros expuestos al fungicida y al piretroide presentaron menos probabilidades de tener N. ceranae. La exposición combinada a la mezcla de tres pesticidas y N. ceranae redujo el crecimiento de la colonia de abejorros y todos los tratamientos tuvieron efectos perjudiciales en la producción de crías. Los grupos expuestos al insecticida neonicotinoide produjeron entre un 40 y un 76% menos de reinas que las colonias control. Nuestros hallazgos muestran que la exposición a combinaciones de factores estresantes con los que los abejorros entran frecuentemente en contacto tiene efectos perjudiciales sobre la salud y el rendimiento de la colonia y, por lo tanto, podría tener un impacto a nivel poblacional. Estos resultados también tienen importantes implicaciones para las prácticas y políticas actuales de evaluación de riesgos y uso de plaguicidas, ya que las combinaciones probadas aquí se aplican con frecuencia simultáneamente en el campo. Comprender las interacciones entre los diferentes factores de estrés es fundamental para mejorar nuestra capacidad de gestión de las poblaciones de abejas y así garantizar los servicios de polinización en el futuro.
Diseases caused by arboviruses transmitted by Aedes aegypti, such as dengue, chikungunya and Zika continue to rise in annual incidence and geographic expansion. A key limitation for achieving control of Ae. aegypti has been the lack of effective tools for monitoring its population, and thus determine what control measures actually work. Surveillance of Ae. aegypti has been based mainly on immature indexes, but they bear little relation to the number of mosquito females, which are the ones capable of transmitting the viruses. The recent development of sampling techniques for adults of this vector species promises to facilitate surveillance and control activities. In this review, the various monitoring techniques for this mosquito are presented, along with a discussion of their usefulness, and recommendations for improved entomological surveillance.
A live-attenuated malaria vaccine, Plasmodium falciparum sporozoite vaccine (PfSPZ Vaccine), confers sterile protection against controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) with Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) parasites homologous to the vaccine strain up to 14 mo after final vaccination. No injectable malaria vaccine has demonstrated long-term protection against CHMI using Pf parasites heterologous to the vaccine strain. Here, we conducted an open-label trial with PfSPZ Vaccine at a dose of 9.0 × 105 PfSPZ administered i.v. three times at 8-wk intervals to 15 malaria-naive adults. After CHMI with homologous Pf parasites 19 wk after final immunization, nine (64%) of 14 (95% CI, 35-87%) vaccinated volunteers remained without parasitemia compared with none of six nonvaccinated controls (P = 0.012). Of the nine nonparasitemic subjects, six underwent repeat CHMI with heterologous Pf7G8 parasites 33 wk after final immunization. Five (83%) of six (95% CI, 36-99%) remained without parasitemia compared with none of six nonvaccinated controls. PfSPZ-specific T-cell and antibody responses were detected in all vaccine recipients. Cytokine production by T cells from vaccinated subjects after in vitro stimulation with homologous (NF54) or heterologous (7G8) PfSPZ were highly correlated. Interestingly, PfSPZ-specific T-cell responses in the blood peaked after the first immunization and were not enhanced by subsequent immunizations. Collectively, these data suggest durable protection against homologous and heterologous Pf parasites can be achieved with PfSPZ Vaccine. Ongoing studies will determine whether protective efficacy can be enhanced by additional alterations in the vaccine dose and number of immunizations.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore retrospective childhood ADHD symptomatology, psychiatric comorbidity, rates of substance-use disorders (SUD), as well as their association with high-risk health behaviors in prison and adverse health outcomes.METHOD: A randomly selected representative sample of inmates in the Puerto Rico correctional system (N = 1,179) was assessed with the Spanish-language Wender Utah Rating Scale (WURS); the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) modules for lifetime/current major depression disorder (MDD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and SUD; the Davidson Trauma Scale (DTS; posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD]); and self-reports of in-site high-risk behaviors.RESULTS: Wald χ(2) tests revealed significant associations of ADHD with MDD and PTSD, as well as increased risk for overdosing and intravenous drug use in prison. A logistic regression model adjusted for mood and anxiety comorbidity predicted lifetime SUD diagnosis (odds ratio = 2.38; 95% confidence interval = [1.15, 4.94]).CONCLUSION: Our results provide further evidence on the association of drug dependence and ADHD symptoms, and their overrepresentation among prison inmates.
Functional polyadenylation [poly(A)] sites consist of two sequence elements, the AAUAAA and G/U box signals, that closely flank the site of mRNA 3'-end formation. In agreement with previous results, random sequence insertions between the AAUAAA and G/U box signals were observed to inhibit poly(A) site function. However, sequence insertions of similar size that were predicted to form RNA stem-loop structures were found to have little effect on the efficiency of polyadenylation and instead induced a 3' shift in the site of polyadenylation that was equal to the length of the inserted stem-loop. The in vivo utilization of a poly(A) site bearing an internal RNA stem-loop structure was inhibited by mutations that destabilized the predicted stem but was restored by compensatory mutations. These results strongly support the hypothesis that the appropriate spacing of the AAUAAA and G/U box signals is critical for poly(A) site function. Sequence insertions that are able to form RNA secondary structures that maintain the correct spacing of these two RNA target sequences are well tolerated, whereas sequence insertions that disturb this spacing inhibit poly(A) site recognition. It is proposed that the effect of sequence insertions on poly(A) site function may be sufficiently predictable to allow the development of an assay for in vivo RNA secondary structure that uses poly(A) site selection as a readout.
Phthiriasis palpebrarum is an infestation of the eyelashes caused by the louse Pthirus pubis (Linnaeus, 1758). We report a case of phthiriasis palpebrarum in a 6-year-old girl, which was initially misdiagnosed as allergic blepharoconjunctivitis. Parasites and their nits were found adhering to the eyelashes and eyelids of her right eye as well as scalp hairs. No abnormality was found in the left eye. The histopathology exam revealed the presence of adults and eggs of Pthirus pubis. We mechanically removed all the eyelashes of the right eye at their base, with lice and nits. The scalp was shaved and washed with phenothrin shampoo. No recurrence was found during 3 months of follow-up. Removal of the eyelashes, cutting of scalp hairs, and phenothrin shampoo may be effective in treating phthiriasis palpebrarum. In cases of blepharoconjunctivitis, eyelids and eyelashes should be carefully examined by slit lamp to avoid misdiagnosis.
DNA methylation of cytosine residues, catalyzed by DNA methyltransferases, is suggested to play important roles in regulating gene expression and plant development. In this study, we isolated four wheat cDNA fragments and one cDNA with open reading frame encoding putative DNA methyltransferase and designated TaMET1, TaMET2a, TaMET2b, TaCMT, TaMET3, respectively. BLASTX searches and phylogenetic analysis suggested that five cDNAs belonged to four classes (Dnmt1, Dnmt2, CMT and Dnmt3) of DNA methyltransferase genes. TaMET2a encoded a protein of 376 aa and contained eight of ten conserved motifs characteristic of DNA methyltransferase. Genomic sequence of TaMET2a was obtained and found to contain ten introns and eleven exons. The expression analysis of the five genes revealed that they were expressed in developing seed, during germination and various vegetative tissues, but in quite different abundance. It was interesting to note that TaMET1 and TaMET3 mRNAs were clearly detected in dry seeds. Moreover, the differential expression patterns of five genes were observed between wheat hybrid and its parents in leaf, stem and root of jointing stage, some were up-regulated while some others were down-regulated in the hybrid. We concluded that multiple wheat DNA methyltransferase genes were present and might play important roles in wheat growth and development.
Migraine is a common, often disabling, neurovascular disease that has been shown to be associated with abnormal serotonergic activity. Drugs that modulate serotonin receptors are commonly used in the acute treatment of a migraine attack. Zolmitriptan, a 5-hydroxytryptophan(1B/1D) receptor agonist, is once such drug that is used in acute migraine therapy. Zolmitriptan is FDA approved for the treatment of acute migraine attacks and there is recent literature demonstrating its efficacy in the acute treatment of cluster attacks. It is rapidly absorbed and is detectable in the plasma within 2 - 5 min for the nasal spray formulation and within 15 min for the oral formulations. Zolmitriptan reaches peak plasma levels in 2 - 4 h and significant plasma levels are maintained for up to 6 h and lower levels for over 15 h. As zolmitriptan's metabolism is predominantly hepatic, patients with severe hepatic impairment should not receive zolmitriptan. However, only 25% of zolmitriptan is bound to plasma proteins and thus it is unlikely for drug interactions involving the displacement of highly protein-bound drugs. Zolmitriptan is generally very well tolerated and less than half of patients in clinical trials have reported adverse events, most of which are mild and transient, although rare serious cardiovascular events have been reported with all triptans. When patients are appropriately selected, zolmitriptan is both a safe and effective acute care migraine treatment. In this review the biological role of serotonin and its receptors is covered, followed by an in-depth review of the pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of zolmitriptan. Finally, the clinical application of zolmitriptan's use in patients is dicussed.
Nucleosomes, the basic units of chromatin, are involved in transcription regulation and DNA replication. Intronless genes, which constitute 3 percent of the human genome, differ from intron-containing genes in evolution and function. Our analysis reveals that nucleosome positioning shows a distinct pattern in intronless and intron-containing genes. The nucleosome occupancy upstream of transcription start sites of intronless genes is lower than that of intron-containing genes. In contrast, high occupancy and well positioned nucleosomes are observed along the gene body of intronless genes, which is perfectly consistent with the barrier nucleosome model. Intronless genes have a significantly lower expression level than intron-containing genes and most of them are not expressed in CD4+ T cell lines and GM12878 cell lines, which results from their tissue specificity. However, the highly expressed genes are at the same expression level between the two types of genes. The highly expressed intronless genes require a higher density of RNA Pol II in an elongating state to compensate for the lack of introns. Additionally, 5' and 3' nucleosome depleted regions of highly expressed intronless genes are deeper than those of highly expressed intron-containing genes.
PURPOSE: To describe the quality of life (QOL) in elderly patients with glioblastoma (GBM) treated with an abbreviated course of radiation therapy (RT; 40 Gy in 15 fractions) plus concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide (TMZ).METHODS AND MATERIALS: Health-related QOL (HRQOL) was assessed by European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire Core-30 (QLQ-C30, version 3) and EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire Brain Cancer Module (QLQ-BN20). Changes from baseline in the score of 9 preselected domains (global QLQ, social functioning, cognitive functioning, emotional functioning, physical functioning, motor dysfunction, communication deficit, fatigue, insomnia) were determined 4 weeks after RT and thereafter every 8 weeks during the treatment until disease progression. The proportion of patients with improved HRQOL scores, defined as a change of 10 points or more, and duration of changes were recorded.RESULTS: Sixty-five patients completed the questionnaires at baseline. The treatment was consistently associated with improvement or stability in most of the preselected HRQOL domains. Global health improved over time; mean score differed by 9.6 points between baseline and 6-month follow-up (P=.03). For social functioning and cognitive functioning, mean scores improved over time, with a maximum difference of 10.4 points and 9.5 points between baseline and 6-month follow-up (P=.01 and P=.02), respectively. By contrast, fatigue worsened over time, with a difference in mean score of 5.6 points between baseline and 4-month follow-up (P=.02).CONCLUSIONS: A short course of RT in combination with TMZ in elderly patients with GBM was associated with survival benefit without a negative effect on HRQOL until the time of disease progression.
Teriflunomide, a once-daily, oral disease-modifying therapy, has demonstrated efficacy in patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS) and patients with a first clinical episode suggestive of MS. As the only disease-modifying therapy with positive disability results in two Phase III trials, teriflunomide significantly slowed disability in patients with relapsing forms of MS. We highlight data from the Phase II study and the TEMSO, TOWER, TOPIC and TENERE teriflunomide studies. TEMSO MRI outcomes have been supported with Structural Image Evaluation Using Normalization of Atrophy analyses. We present data from long-term extensions of the Phase II study, TEMSO and TOWER, as well as results from patients who switched from other disease-modifying therapies to teriflunomide, patient-reported outcomes and supplementary measures of response.
Double homeobox 4 (DUX4) is a candidate disease gene for facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD), one of the most common muscular dystrophies characterized by progressive skeletal muscle degeneration. Despite great strides in understanding precise genetics of FSHD, the molecular pathophysiology of the disease remains unclear. One of the major limitations has been the availability of appropriate molecular tools to study DUX4 protein. In the present study, we report the development of five new monoclonal antibodies targeted against the N- and C-termini of human DUX4, and characterize their reactivity using Western blot and immunofluorescence staining. Additionally, we show that expression of the canonical full coding DUX4 induces cell death in human primary muscle cells, whereas the expression of a shorter splice form of DUX4 results in no such toxicity. Immunostaining with these new antibodies reveals a differential effect of two DUX4 isoforms on human muscle cells. These antibodies will provide an excellent tool for investigating the role of DUX4 in FSHD pathogenesis.
PURPOSE: Lenalidomide (CC-5013, Revlimid; Celgene Corporation, Summit, NJ), a thalidomide analogue, was granted approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on June 29, 2006, for use in combination with dexamethasone in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) who have received at least one prior therapy. The FDA approved lenalidomide with a restricted distribution program, RevAssist.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In two randomized, double-blind, multicenter studies, the combination of lenalidomide and dexamethasone (LD) was compared with placebo and dexamethasone (PD) in patients with MM who had received at least one prior therapy. The primary endpoint was time to progression (TTP).RESULTS: Following a prespecified interim analysis of TTP, an independent data-monitoring committee advised the sponsor to halt the two studies. For both studies, the interim analysis for efficacy revealed a statistically significant longer TTP with LD than with PD. The most clinically relevant grade 3 and 4 adverse events that occurred more frequently in the LD arm were neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and atrial fibrillation. Thrombotic or thromboembolic events, including deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, thrombosis, and intracranial venous sinus thrombosis were reported more frequently in patients treated with LD than with PD.CONCLUSIONS: The FDA approved lenalidomide based on interim results from two multicenter, placebo-controlled, randomized trials comparing the combination of LD with PD that revealed a longer TTP with LD than with PD. The major toxicity observed during these trials was myelosuppression. The serious toxicities included thromboembolic events. Lenalidomide is only available under the RevAssist Program.
Oral administration of 400 mg/kg of 13-cis retinoic acid to 9 day pregnant mice gives rise to important maxillofacial malformations. The first manifestation of teratogenic effect is an increase of density of cell death arising in the dorsal part of the first two branchial arches at day 9.5. These two arches become hypoplastic at days 10 and 11, and the preskeletal anlagen appear too late in comparison to control embryos. Meckel's cartilage is too curvilinear and medially situated. Pre-ossicular and pre-mandibular blastemata develop with spatial distortions which are well analyzable at days 16 and 17. They give some arguments to discuss several features of normal early development of this area.
Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe muscle wasting disorder caused by mutations in the DMD gene, affecting 1 in 3500 newborn males. Complete loss of muscle dystrophin protein causes progressive muscle weakness and heart and respiratory failure, leading to premature death. Antisense oligonucleotides (AONs) that bind to complementary sequences of the dystrophin pre-mRNA to induce skipping of the targeted exon by modulating pre-mRNA splicing are promising therapeutic agents for DMD. Such AONs can restore the open reading frame of the DMD gene and produce internally deleted, yet partially functional dystrophin protein isoforms in skeletal muscle. Within the last few years, clinical trials using AONs have made considerable progress demonstrating the restoration of functional dystrophin protein and acceptable safety profiles following both local and systemic delivery in DMD patients. However, improvement of AON delivery and efficacy, along with the development of multiple AONs to treat as many DMD patients as possible needs to be addressed for this approach to fulfill its potential. Here, we review the recent progress made in clinical trials using AONs to treat DMD and discuss the current challenges to the development of AON-based therapy for DMD.
AIM: Autophagy-related gene 5 (ATG5), ATG7, B-lymphoid tyrosine kinase (BLK) and B-cell scaffold protein with ankyrin repeats 1 (BANK1) are involved in B-cell signaling; several genome-wide association studies detected these genes as candidates involved in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). We aimed to replicate the association of these genes with SLE in Chinese Han and to search for possible gene-gene interactions.METHODS: TaqMan single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping was used to detect rs548234, rs665791 in ATG5, rs11706903 in ATG7, rs2736340 in BLK and rs10516487 in BANK1 in 382 SLE patients and 660 healthy controls. The epistasis effect was analyzed by logistic regression, multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) and linear regression analysis.RESULTS: SLE was associated with frequency of rs548234 (P = 0.010; odds ratio [OR] = 1.298), rs2736340 (P = 2.47 × 10-5 ; OR = 1.574) and rs10516487 (P = 0.002; OR = 0.642). Although no epistasis effects were found among three autophagy-related gene loci or with rs2736340 and rs10516487, BLK and BANK1 had the closest interaction effect on logistic regression analysis (P = 0.013; OR = 1.205), MDR (P < 0.0001), and linear regression analysis (P = 0.0017; R2 = 0.1806). The risk genotype TT of rs2736340 was associated with decreased messenger RNA level of BLK; BLK transcript level was lower in SLE patients than healthy controls.CONCLUSION: We confirmed the association of rs548234, rs2736340 and rs10516487 with SLE in Chinese Han and reinforced our hypothesis of their epistasis effect in regulating B-cell signaling in SLE.
Cardiovascular consequences of thyroid diseases, their prevalence and treatment, particularly in cases with subclinical hyper- and hypothyroidism. The aim of the study was to draw attention to an association between the thyroid and cardiovascular diseases. The main topic was to lay emphasis on the importance of cardiovascular diseases caused by subclinical hyper- and hypothyroidism in the relation to the practice. The subclinical states precede the overt hyper- and hypothyroidism, and they are often present during their treatments. The changes in the levels of thyrotropin demonstrating subclinical thyroid diseases, could be detected in different non-thyroid diseases and resulted from the effect of some drugs. Particularly, the subclinical thyroid diseases become more frequent in older age. In the background of the high prevalences of atrial fibrillation, hypertension and psychosomatic events subclinical hyperthyroidism could be revealed. Subclinical hypothyroidism is characterized by an increased prevalence of elevated serum lipid levels, atherosclerosis, ischemic heart disease and hypertension often associating with the presence of anti-thyroid antibodies.

Bisphenol A (BPA) is an endocrine-disruptor compound that exhibits estrogenic activity. BPA is used in the production of materials such as polycarbonate plastics, epoxy resins and dental sealants. Whereas, the endocrine modulating activity of BPA and its effects on reproductive health have been widely studied, its effects on the function of the immune system are poorly characterized. This might be attributable to the different BPA doses used in a diversity of animal models. Moreover, most studies of the effect of BPA on the immune response are limited to in vitro and in vivo studies that have focused primarily on the impact of BPA on the number and proportion of immune cell populations, without evaluating its effects on immune function in response to an antigenic challenge or infectious pathogens. In this review, we discuss the current literature on the effects of BPA on the function of immune system that potentially increases the susceptibility to infections by the virtue of acting as a pro-inflammatory molecule. Thus, it appears that BPA, while by such an impact might be useful in the control of certain disease states that are helped by an inflmmatory response, it can worsen the prognosis of diseases that are adversely affected by inflammation.
Although the human O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase (AGT) is very sensitive to inactivation by O6-benzylguanine (BG) or 2,4-diamino-6-benzyloxy-5-nitrosopyrimidine (5-nitroso-BP), the equivalent protein formed by the carboxyl terminal domain of the product of the Escherichia coli ada gene (Ada-C) is unaffected by these inhibitors. This difference is remarkable in view of the substantial similarity between these proteins (33% of the residues in the common sequence are identical) and is potentially very important since these inhibitors are under development as drugs to enhance the anti-tumor activity of alkylating agents. In order to understand the reason for the resistance of the Ada-C protein, we have made chimeras between Ada-C and AGT sequences and mutations in the Ada-C protein, expressed the altered proteins in an E. coli strain lacking endogenous alkyltransferase activity and tested the inactivation of the resulting proteins by BG or 5-nitroso-BP. Chimeric alkyltransferase proteins were made in which the residues on the amino side of the cysteine acceptor site came from Ada-C and the residues on the carboxyl side came from AGT and vice versa but these did not show sensitivity to BG suggesting that resistance is produced by residues in both segments of the protein. Analysis of the Ada-C mutant proteins revealed two sites for mutations that confer sensitivity to these inhibitors. One of these was tryptophan-336 and the other was residues lysine-314 and alanine-316. Thus, when the combined mutations of A316P/W336A were made in the Ada-C sequence, the protein was sensitive to inactivation by BG. This A316P/W336A mutant protein was even more sensitive to 5-nitroso-BP and the mutant proteins W336A, K314P/A316P and A316P could also be inhibited by this drug (in decreasing order of sensitivity) although the control Ada-C and a mutant R335S were not inhibited. These results provide strong support for the hypothesis that the resistance of the Ada-C alkyl-transferase is due to a steric effect limiting access to the active site. Insertion of proline residues at positions 314 and 316 and removal of the bulky tryptophan residue at position 336 increases the space available at the active site and permits these inhibitors to be effective.
Pharmacogenetics (PGX) is the study of drug response as a function of an individual's DNA. PGX is often viewed as an extension of disease association genetics, and although this information may be related, it is not the study of drug response. Although medicines are used to treat diseases, the value of strategies that identify and incorporate DNA biomarkers associated with clinical efficacy, or DNA biomarkers for untoward clinical responses, can be applied directly to pharmaceutical pipelines. The growth of adverse event PGX studies involving marketed medicines generally uses relatively large numbers of affected patients, but has been productive. However, the two critical strategies for pipeline genetics must make use of fewer patients: (1) the early identification of efficacy signals so that they can be applied early in development for targeted therapies and (2) identification of safety signals that can subsequently be validated prospectively during development using the least number of patients with adverse responses. Assumptions are often made that large numbers of patients are necessary to recognize PGX hypotheses and to validate DNA biomarkers. In some ways, pipeline pharmacogenetics may be viewed as the opposite of current genome-wide scanning designs. The goal is to obtain PGX signals in as few patients as possible, and then validate PGX hypotheses for specificity and sensitivity as development trials go forward--not using hundreds of thousand of markers to detect strong linkage disequilibrium signals in thousands of patients and their controls. Drug development takes 5-7 years for a drug candidate to traverse to registration--and this is similar to the timeframe for validating genetic biomarkers using sequential clinical trials. Two important examples are discussed, the association of APOE genotypes to the demonstration of actionable efficacy signals for the use of rosiglitazone for Alzheimer's disease; and the identification of HLA-B(*)5701 as a highly sensitive and specific predictive marker for abacavir treated patients who will develop hypersensitivity syndrome (HSS). The rosiglitazone study prevented pipeline attrition by changing the interpretation of a critical Phase IIB proof of concept study (2005) from a failed study, to a positive efficacy response in a genetically predictable proportion of patients. Now, three years later, a Phase III program of clinical trials using pharmacogenetic designs is months away from completion (late08). If successfully registered (early09), millions of patients could benefit, and efficacy PGX would have achieved its first prospective block-buster. The use of safety candidate gene association genetics in patients who received abacavir therapy and developed HSS starting in 1998 culminated in a double blind clinical trial that determined sensitivity > 97% and specificity >99% in 2007. Clinical consensus panels rapidly recommended abacavir as the preferred therapy along with HLA-B(*)5701 pre-testing, immediately increasing the market share of abacavir with respect to other reverse transcriptases that are associated with there own adverse events. Targeting of medicines during drug development is now possible, practical, and profitable.
The ability of bicuculline, a GABA antagonist, to enhance dopamine (DA) synthesis in retinas of rats 1, 4, 7, 15 and 60 days after eye opening was assessed and compared to the time course of postnatal development of the light-induced increase in DA synthesis. The accumulation of dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) following administration of the L-aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, NSD 1015, was used to estimate DA synthesis. In dark-adapted rats, neither bicuculline nor light enhanced DOPA accumulation 1 day after eye opening, but on the remaining days either treatment significantly augmented DA synthesis, and by day 15 the effects were as great as those observed in adult retinas. At each time point, the magnitude of the drug effect on DA synthesis in the dark was similar to that observed following light exposure. These results suggest that an endogenous GABAergic input to the DA neurons appears at the same time as the acquisition of the dopaminergic response to light. The effect of bicuculline treatment on DA synthesis in light-exposed animals was also assessed. At 4 and 7 days the drug significantly enhanced DOPA accumulation over that produced by exposure to light alone, but on later days bicuculline exerted no such additive effect. These data imply that early in the maturation of the light response mechanisms other than removal of an inhibitory GABAergic tone may be partially responsible for excitation of the DA neurons.
The amniotic band syndrome is a collection of congenital deformities presumably due to rupture of amniotic sac. It appears to cause fetal injury through three basic mechanisms including malformation, disruption, and deformation. The associated anomalies vary from minor digital defect to major craniofacial and visceral defects. They can be categorized as neural tube-like defects, craniofacial anomalies, limb anomalies, abdominal and thoracic wall defects, visceral anomalies, and constriction bands. We present two autopsy cases and discuss the diagnostic features. Our findings support Torpin's theory that the fibrous constriction bands generated from early rupture of the amnion. An accurate diagnosis may be achieved by looking for the major features of amniotic band syndrome and a routine chromosome study and placental examination in cases with multiple congenital deformities.
The epigenetic regulation of DNA structure and function is essential for changes in gene expression involved in development, growth, and maintenance of cellular function. Epigenetic changes include histone modifications such as methylation, acetylation, ubiquitination, and phosphorylation. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) proteins have a major role in epigenetic regulation of chromatin structure. HDACs are enzymes that catalyze the removal of acetyl groups from lysine residues within histones, as well as a range of other proteins including transcriptional factors. HDACs are highly conserved proteins divided into two families and based on sequence similarity in four classes. Here we will discuss the roles of Rpd3 in physiology and longevity with emphasis on its role in flies. Rpd3, the Drosophila HDAC1 homolog, is a class I lysine deacetylase and a member of a large family of HDAC proteins. Rpd3 has multiple functions including control of proliferation, development, metabolism, and aging. Pharmacological and dietary HDAC inhibitors have been used as therapeutics in psychiatry, cancer, and neurology.
INTRODUCTION: Retapamulin is a novel, topical antibacterial of the pleuromutilin class in development for the treatment of secondarily infected traumatic lesions of the skin.METHODS: The efficacy, safety, and tolerability of topical retapamulin ointment, 1% for 5 days twice daily was evaluated in 2 identical, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, multicenter studies vs oral cephalexin, 500 mg twice daily for 10 days, in 1904 patients with secondarily infected traumatic lesions.RESULTS: Clinical success rates were 89.5% in protocol-adherent patients receiving retapamulin compared with 91.9% for cephalexin (treatment difference, -2.5% [95% confidence interval, -5.4% to 0.5%]). In patients with Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes at baseline, clinical success was 89.2% (365/409) for retapamulin and 92.6% (63/68) for cephalexin. Safety and tolerability were similar between treatments. Noncompliance (defined as using or taking <80% of doses) was recorded in 8.0% (51/636) of patients taking cephalexin compared with 0.39% (5/1268) of patients receiving retapamulin.CONCLUSIONS: Retapamulin offers a novel, effective, and convenient topical treatment for secondarily infected traumatic lesions.
OBJECTIVE: Chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency (CCSVI) was recently described in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). The hypothesis of the vascular aetiology provides a new approach in the investigation and treatment of MS.METHODS: Our open-label study included 94 MS patients who fulfilled ultrasound sonographic criteria required for CCSVI. The internal jugular and/or azygous veins by a catheter venography were dilated.RESULTS: In 34.8% of the patients unilateral, in 65.2% bilateral venous abnormalities and in 2.1% no luminal obstructions were demonstrated. The patient group with the higher disability score had a significantly higher number of venous lesions (P < 0.005). Significant improvement of clinical disability in relapsing-remitting patients was (P < 0.001) achieved. In our study no stents were used. Re-stenosis occurred in 21.7% of the patients.CONCLUSION: The number of venous narrowings is higher in more disabled patients. A significant improvement in clinical disability in the relapsing-remitting group was observed.
OBJECTIVES: Consensus guidelines for bone management of patients taking corticosteroids suggest two main interventions: Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scanning in those taking prednisolone > or =7.5 mg daily for > or =6 months (repeated every 1-3 years as indicated). Bisphosphonate therapy for those taking prednisolone > or =15 mg daily for > or =6 months regardless of DEXA result, and also for patients with known or high risk of developing osteoporosis (including those aged >65 years).MATERIAL AND METHODS: We audited adherence to these guidelines in all adults with myasthenia gravis (MG) attending our neurology service.RESULTS: Of 80 patients with MG (47 male, mean age 63.3 years), 34 (43%) had received corticosteroids for > or =6 months. Eighteen were taking prednisolone > or =7.5 mg daily (mean dose 16.6 mg) yet only 4 of these (22%) had undergone DEXA scanning. Of the 13 patients meeting the guideline criteria to receive bisphosphonate therapy, this was prescribed to only 7 (54%). Two others were prescribed vitamin D, 2 a calcium supplement and 2 were receiving no prophylaxis.CONCLUSION: In these MG patients the guidelines were followed in only a minority. Neurologists need greater awareness of the bone health consequences of prescribing long-term corticosteroids.
OBJECTIVES: Ventralis intermedius deep brain stimulation is an established intervention for medication-refractory essential tremor. Newer constant current stimulation technology offers theoretical advantage over the traditional constant voltage systems in terms of delivering a more biologically stable therapy. There are no previous reports on the outcomes of constant current deep brain stimulation in the treatment of essential tremor. This study aimed to evaluate the long-term efficacy of ventralis intermedius constant current deep brain stimulation in patients diagnosed with essential tremor.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Essential tremor patients implanted with constant current deep brain stimulation for a minimum of three years were evaluated. Clinical outcomes were assessed using the Fahn-Tolosa-Marin tremor rating scale at baseline and postoperatively at the time of evaluation. The quality of life in the patients was assessed using the Quality of Life in Essential Tremor questionnaire.RESULTS: Ten patients were evaluated with a median age at evaluation of 74 years (range 66-79) and a mean follow up time of 49.7 (range 36-78) months since starting stimulation. Constant current ventralis intermedius deep brain stimulation was well tolerated and effective in all patients with a mean score improvement from 50.7 ± 5.9 to 17.4 ± 5.7 (p = 0.0020) in the total Fahn-Tolosa-Marin rating scale score (65.6%). Furthermore, the total combined mean Quality of Life in Essential Tremor score was improved from 56.2 ± 4.9 to 16.8 ± 3.5 (p value = 0.0059) (70.1%).CONCLUSION: This report shows that long-term constant current ventralis intermedius deep brain stimulation is a safe and effective intervention for essential tremor patients.
Pancreatic cholesterol esterase (CEase) is a serine hydrolase involved in the hydrolysis of variety of lipids and transport of free cholesterol. In this study, pharmacophore hypotheses based on known inhibitors were generated using common feature pharmacophore generation protocol available in Discovery Studio program. The best pharmacophore model containing two hydrogen bond acceptor and three hydrophobic features was selected and validated. It was further used in screening three diverse chemical databases. Hit compounds were subjected to drug-likeness and molecular docking studies. Four hits, namely SEW00846, NCI0040784, GK03167, and CD10645, were selected based on the GOLD fitness score and interaction with active site amino acids. All hit compounds were further optimized to improve their binding in the active site. The optimized compounds were found to have improved binding at the active site. Strongly binding optimized hits at the active site can act as virtual leads in potent CEase inhibitor designing.
Between the years 1968 and 1979, 87 cases of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) appeared among the Israeli-born population. The incidence of SSPE dropped sharply in 1977, 10 years (the median age at onset of SSPE) after introduction of mass antimeasles vaccination, and remained low in 1978 and 1979. Most of the SSPE cases reported measles at an age significantly younger than that of the general population. This pattern did not change after introduction of antimeasles vaccination. Incidence was significantly lower (p less than 10(-9) in the vaccinated population than in the unvaccinated population. Occurrence of SSPE in some children who were vaccinated against measles could be explained by incomplete vaccine efficacy, or by older age at vaccination, which allows the possibility of prior exposure to measles. There was no indication that measles vaccine can induce SSPE.
Mature T cells express either CD4 or CD8 on their surface. Most helper T cells express CD4, which binds to class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins, and most cytotoxic T cells express CD8, which binds to class I MHC proteins. In the thymus, mature CD4+CD8- and CD4-CD8+ T cells expressing alpha beta T-cell antigen receptors (TCR) develop from immature thymocytes through CD4+CD8+ alpha beta TCR+ intermediates. Experiments using mice transgenic for alpha beta TCR suggest that the specificity of the TCR determines the CD4/CD8 phenotype of mature T cells. These results, however, do not indicate how a T cell differentiates into the CD4 or CD8 lineage. Here we show that the CD4 transmembrane region and/or cytoplasmic tail mediates the delivery of a specific signal that directs differentiation of T cells to a CD4 lineage. We generated transgenic mice expressing a hybrid molecule composed of the CD8 alpha extracellular domains linked to the CD4 transmembrane region and cytoplasmic tail. We predicted that this hybrid molecule would bind to class I MHC proteins through the extracellular domains but deliver the intracellular signals characteristic of CD4. By crossing our transgenic mice with mice expressing a transgenic alpha beta TCR specific for a particular antigen plus class I MHC protein, we were able to express the hybrid molecule in developing thymocytes expressing the class I MHC-restricted TCR. Our results show that the signal transduced by the hybrid molecule results in the differentiation of immature thymocytes expressing a class I-restricted TCR into mature T cells expressing CD4.
Apolipoprotein E (apoE) is important in the modulation of the catabolism of chylomicron and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) remnants. ApoE has three major genetically determined isoproteins in plasma, designated apoE-2, apoE-3 and apoE-4, with homozygosity for the allele coding for apoE-2 being associated with dysbetalipoproteinemia or type III hyperlipoproteinemia (HLP). We describe a new variant of apoE, apoE-1Harrisburg, which is, in contrast to apoE-2, dominantly associated with type III HLP. Five of twelve members of the affected kindred are heterozygous for the mutant form of apoE, and four of the five have type III HLP, while the fifth member has dysbetalipoproteinemia on diet therapy. Neuraminidase digestion, which removes charged sialic acid residues, did not alter the electrophoretic position of the apoE-1Harrisburg isoprotein, indicating that the altered charge of apoE-1Harrisburg was not due to sialic acid addition to the apolipoprotein. Cysteamine modification, which adds a positively charged group to cysteine, resulted in a shift of apoE-1Harrisburg from the E-1 to the E-2 isoform position, indicating that there is one cysteine in apoE-1Harrisburg as is the case for apoE-3. These results are consistent with apoE-1Harrisburg originating in the allele for apoE-3 with the mutation leading to a negative two-unit charge shift. The definitive identification of a kindred with an apoE variant, apoE-1Harrisburg, dominantly associated with dysbetalipoproteinemia and type III HLP provides a unique opportunity to gain important insights into the structure-function requirements of the E apolipoprotein as well as the mechanisms by which apoE modulates lipoprotein metabolism.
AIM: Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) is a cardioactive molecule produced in the myocardium. BNP is a sensitive marker of cardiac failure and its measurement in blood could be useful to the diagnosis and the treatment of this disease. Sporting activities, especially endurance ones, can induce cardiac problems, owing to the high workload for the myocardium during long and ultralong heavy effort. There are 2 papers describing the behavior of BNP in endurance events. BNP was elevated in marathoners, immediately after the race and also after 4 h. We studied the behavior of BNP in the triathlon, which is a complex sport characterized by 3 different activities (swimming, cycling, running).METHODS: We recruited 49 athletes, all males, except for 4 females; 2 athletes did not finish the race and were not included in the statistical analysis in 2 different competitions. In these subjects we measured BNP using an immunological method before and after a triathlon.RESULTS: No statistical significance between BNP values, before and after the triathlon, was found.CONCLUSIONS: We found no significant differences between pre- and postcompetition BNP values. Moreover, the range of values in both the blood drawings are similar of those of the general population, representing the biological variability of the analyte. The values in regularly trained athletes,, are not different from the general population and BNP is not modified by a triathlon, a typical endurance sport performance. We can underline that BNP increases in plasma are induced by heavy pathologies and are not influenced by physical activities, even strenuous ones.
BACKGROUND: It has recently been shown that the detection of gene fusion events across genomes can be used for predicting functional associations of proteins, including physical interaction or complex formation. To obtain such predictions we have made an exhaustive search for gene fusion events within 24 available completely sequenced genomes.RESULTS: Each genome was used as a query against the remaining 23 complete genomes to detect gene fusion events. Using an improved, fully automatic protocol, a total of 7,224 single-domain proteins that are components of gene fusions in other genomes were detected, many of which were identified for the first time. The total number of predicted pairwise functional associations is 39,730 for all genomes. Component pairs were identified by virtue of their similarity to 2,365 multidomain composite proteins. We also show for the first time that gene fusion is a complex evolutionary process with a number of contributory factors, including paralogy, genome size and phylogenetic distance. On average, 9% of genes in a given genome appear to code for single-domain, component proteins predicted to be functionally associated. These proteins are detected by an additional 4% of genes that code for fused, composite proteins.CONCLUSIONS: These results provide an exhaustive set of functionally associated genes and also delineate the power of fusion analysis for the prediction of protein interactions.
Disruption of FOXP2, a gene encoding a forkhead-domain transcription factor, causes a severe developmental disorder of verbal communication, involving profound articulation deficits, accompanied by linguistic and grammatical impairments. Investigation of the neural basis of this disorder has been limited previously to neuroimaging of affected children and adults. The discovery of the gene responsible, FOXP2, offers a unique opportunity to explore the relevant neural mechanisms from a molecular perspective. In the present study, we have determined the detailed spatial and temporal expression pattern of FOXP2 mRNA in the developing brain of mouse and human. We find expression in several structures including the cortical plate, basal ganglia, thalamus, inferior olives and cerebellum. These data support a role for FOXP2 in the development of corticostriatal and olivocerebellar circuits involved in motor control. We find intriguing concordance between regions of early expression and later sites of pathology suggested by neuroimaging. Moreover, the homologous pattern of FOXP2/Foxp2 expression in human and mouse argues for a role for this gene in development of motor-related circuits throughout mammalian species. Overall, this study provides support for the hypothesis that impairments in sequencing of movement and procedural learning might be central to the FOXP2-related speech and language disorder.
Indian hedgehog (Ihh), a member of the vertebrate hedgehog morphogen family, is a key signaling molecule that controls chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation. In this study, we show a novel function of Ihh. Namely, it acts as an essential mediator of mechanotransduction in cartilage. Cyclic mechanical stress greatly induces the expression of Ihh by chondrocytes. This induction is abolished by gadolinium, an inhibitor of stretch-activated channels. This suggests that the IHH gene is mechanoresponsive. The mechano-induction of Ihh is essential for stimulating chondrocyte proliferation by mechanical loading. The presence of an Ihh functional blocking antibody during loading completely abolishes the stimulatory effect of mechanical load on proliferation. Furthermore, Ihh mediates the mechanotransduction process in a bone morphogenic protein (BMP)-dependent and parathyroid hormone-related peptide-independent manner. BMP 2/4 are up-regulated by mechanical stress through the induction of Ihh, and BMP antagonist noggin inhibits mechanical stimulation of chondrocyte proliferation. This suggests BMP lies downstream of Ihh in mechanotransduction pathway. Our data suggest that Ihh may transduce mechanical signals during cartilage growth and repair processes.
The suppression of oncogenic levels of MYC is sufficient to induce sustained tumor regression associated with proliferative arrest, differentiation, cellular senescence, and/or apoptosis, a phenomenon known as oncogene addiction. However, after prolonged inactivation of MYC in a conditional transgenic mouse model of Eμ-tTA/tetO-MYC T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, some of the tumors recur, recapitulating what is frequently observed in human tumors in response to targeted therapies. Here we report that these recurring lymphomas express either transgenic or endogenous Myc, albeit in many cases at levels below those in the original tumor, suggesting that tumors continue to be addicted to MYC. Many of the recurring lymphomas (76%) harbored mutations in the tetracycline transactivator, resulting in expression of the MYC transgene even in the presence of doxycycline. Some of the remaining recurring tumors expressed high levels of endogenous Myc, which was associated with a genomic rearrangement of the endogenous Myc locus or activation of Notch1. By gene expression profiling, we confirmed that the primary and recurring tumors have highly similar transcriptomes. Importantly, shRNA-mediated suppression of the high levels of MYC in recurring tumors elicited both suppression of proliferation and increased apoptosis, confirming that these tumors remain oncogene addicted. These results suggest that tumors induced by MYC remain addicted to overexpression of this oncogene.
INTRODUCTION: Harlequin phenomenon is characterized by a strictly unilateral erythrosis of the face with flushing and hyperhydrosis, and controlaterally a pale anhydrotic aspect. This syndrome can occur alone or associated to other dysautonomic phenomena such as Horner syndrome, Adie syndrome or Ross syndrome.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We report three cases: two patients presented a Harlequin sign, associated with Horner syndrome for one and Ross syndrome for the second. The etiologic investigation was normal, allowing recognizing the idiopathic nature of the disorder. For the third patient, Harlequin syndrome was observed in a neoplastic context due to breast cancer, metastatic dissemination, and bone metastases involving the right side of the T2 body.DISCUSSION: We reviewed the literature: 108 cases have been described. This syndrome occurred alone in 48 patients and was associated with other dysautonomic syndromes such as Horner syndrome in 38 patients, Holmes Adie syndrome in six, and Ross syndrome in six; both Ross and Holmes Adie syndrome were associated five cases and associations were not reported in five patients. The pathophysiological mechanisms of this autonomic cranial neuropathy, the possible etiologies, and therapeutic management were discussed.CONCLUSION: Harlequin phenomenon with flushing and unilateral hyperhydrosis is rare, occurring alone or in combination with other autonomic syndromes of the face. Idiopathic in two-thirds of cases, Harlequin phenomenon does not require specific treatment; sympathectomy may be discussed in the severe cases with a significant social impact.
Vancomycin binds to bacterial cell-wall intermediates to achieve its antibiotic effect. Infections of vancomycin-resistant enterococci are, however, becoming an increasing problem; the bacteria are resistant because they synthesize different cell-wall intermediates. The enzymes involved in cell-wall biosynthesis, therefore, are potential targets for combating this resistance. Recent biochemical and crystallographic results are providing mechanistic and structural details about some of these targets.
Recent works have demonstrated a rare functional variant (R47H) in triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells (TREM) 2 gene, encoding TREM2 protein, increase susceptibility to late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), with an odds ratio similar to that of the apolipoprotein E ε4 allele. The reduced function of TREM2 was speculated to be the main cause in the pathogenic effects of this risk variant, and TREM2 is highly expressed in white matter, as well as in the hippocampus and neocortex, which is partly consistent with the pathological features reported in AD brain, indicating the possible involvement of TREM2 in AD pathogenesis. Emerging evidence has demonstrated that TREM2 could suppress inflammatory response by repression of microglia-mediated cytokine production and secretion, which may prevent inflammation-induced bystander damage of neurons. TREM2 also participates in the regulation of phagocytic pathways that are responsible for the removal of neuronal debris. In this article, we review the recent epidemiological findings of TREM2 that related with late-onset AD and speculate the possible roles of TREM2 in progression of this disease. Based on the potential protective actions of TREM2 in AD pathogenesis, targeting TREM2 might provide new opportunities for AD treatment.
Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have become an important therapeutic option for treating several forms of cancer. Gefitinib, an inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), is in clinical use for treating non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring activating EGFR mutations. However, despite high initial response rates, many patients develop resistance to gefitinib. The molecular mechanisms of TKI resistance often remain unclear. Here, we describe a chemical proteomic approach comprising kinase affinity purification (kinobeads) and quantitative mass spectrometry for the identification of kinase inhibitor resistance mechanisms in cancer cells. We identified the previously described amplification of MET and found EPHA2 to be more than 10-fold overexpressed (p < 0.001) in gefitinib-resistant HCC827 cells suggesting a potential role in developing resistance. siRNA-mediated EPHA2 knock-down or treating cells with the multikinase inhibitor dasatinib restored sensitivity to gefitinib. Of all dasatinib targets, EPHA2 exhibited the most drastic effect (p < 0.001). In addition, EPHA2 knockdown or ephrin-A1 treatment of resistant cells decreased FAK phosphorylation and cell migration. These findings confirm EPHA2 as an actionable drug target, provide a rational basis for drug combination approaches, and indicate that chemical proteomics is broadly applicable for the discovery of kinase inhibitor resistance.

We report a 19-year-old, non-Amish Caucasian female patient with primary amenorrhea caused by complete lack of Müllerian fusion with vaginal agenesis or Müllerian aplasia (MA), postaxial polydactyly (PAP), and tetralogy of Fallot. The genital tract anomaly of MA with and without renal or skeletal anomalies comprises Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome, which has not been reported with tetralogy of Fallot. The phenotypic triad of anomalies most closely resembled McKusick-Kaufman syndrome (MKS; OMIM 236700), a rare multiple congenital anomaly syndrome comprised of hydrometrocolpos (HMC), PAP, and congenital heart malformation that is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. While upper reproductive tract anomalies have not been reported with MKS, they have been reported with Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS), a syndrome that significantly overlaps with MKS. Both MKS and BBS can be caused by mutations in the MKKS or BBS6 gene on chromosome 20p12 and BBS is also associated with mutations in other genes (BBS1, BBS2, BBS4, and BBS7). To address this heterogenity, we sequenced the causative genes in MKS and BBS but no mutations in these five genes were identified. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) excluded large deletions of chromosome 20p12 and microsatellite marker studies confirmed biparental inheritance for all of the known BBS loci. The dual midline fusion defects of tetralogy of Fallot and MA suggests that either this patient has a unique syndrome with a distinct genetic etiology or that she has a genetically heterogeneous or variant form of MKS.
Publisher: RéSUMé: OBJECTIF: Le score simplifié d’Apfel, mis au point en 1999, est l’outil le plus utilisé pour la stratification des risques de nausées et vomissements postopératoires (NVPO). Il comprend quatre facteurs de risque : le sexe féminin, un statut de non-fumeur, les antécédents de NVPO ou de mal des transports, et l’utilisation d’opioïdes postopératoires. Néanmoins, il existe une hétérogénéité considérable dans la définition et l’application de ces facteurs de risque dans la recherche sur les NVPO. Notre objectif était de déterminer comment ces facteurs de risque étaient appliqués dans les études utilisant le score Apfel. MéTHODE: Les citations comportant dans leur index une mention du score d’Apfel entre le 1er septembre 1999 et le 1er septembre 2019 ont été identifiées dans la base de données Scopus. Les comptes rendus originaux en texte intégral en anglais mesurant les quatre facteurs de risque ont été inclus dans notre analyse. Les données recueillies comprenaient la définition, le moment et la méthode de collecte des quatre facteurs de risque. RéSULTATS: Parmi les études identifiées, 255 sur 535 documentaient les quatre facteurs de risque, et les scores d’Apfel calculés ont été rapportés dans 116 des 255 (46 %) articles. Le tabagisme, les NVPO, le mal des transports et l’utilisation postopératoire d’opioïdes ont été définis dans quatre (2 %), zéro (0 %), un (0,4 %) et sept (3 %) articles, respectivement. La consommation postopératoire d’opioïdes a été définie comme « anticipée » dans 138 (54 %) études et « réelle » dans 72 (18 %) études, et n’était pas claire dans 45 (28 %) études. CONCLUSION: Il existe d’importantes variations dans la façon dont les facteurs de risque d’Apfel sont définis et appliqués dans la recherche sur les NVPO, particulièrement en ce qui concerne l’utilisation postopératoire d’opioïdes. Des recommandations plus claires pour l’application de cet outil pourraient optimiser l’estimation des risques et la prophylaxie pour les NVPO, et potentiellement améliorer la qualité de la recherche.
In eukaryotic cells, non-translating mRNAs can accumulate into cytoplasmic mRNP (messenger ribonucleoprotein) granules such as P-bodies (processing bodies) and SGs (stress granules). P-bodies contain the mRNA decay and translational repression machineries and are ubiquitously expressed in mammalian cells and lower eukaryote species including Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans. In contrast, SGs are only detected during cellular stress when translation is inhibited and form from aggregates of stalled pre-initiation complexes. SGs and P-bodies are related to NGs (neuronal granules), which are essential in the localization and control of mRNAs in neurons. Importantly, RNA granules are linked to the cytoskeleton, which plays an important role in mediating many of their dynamic properties. In the present review, we discuss how P-bodies, SGs and NGs are linked to cytoskeletal networks and the importance of these linkages in maintaining localization of their RNA cargoes.
Magnetoreception is essential for magnetic orientation in animal migration. The molecular basis for magnetoreception has recently been elucidated in fruitfly as complexes between the magnetic receptor magnetoreceptor (MagR) and its ligand cryptochrome (Cry). MagR and Cry are present in the animal kingdom. However, it is unknown whether they perform a conserved role in diverse animals. Here we report the identification and expression of zebrafish MagR and Cry homologs towards understanding their roles in lower vertebrates. A single magr gene and 7 cry genes are present in the zebrafish genome. Zebrafish has four cry1 genes (cry1aa, cry1ab, cry1ba and cry1bb) homologous to human CRY1 and a single ortholog of human CRY2 as well as 2 cry-like genes (cry4 and cry5). By RT-PCR, magr exhibited a high level of ubiquitous RNA expression in embryos and adult organs, whereas cry genes displayed differential embryonic and adult expression. Importantly, magr depletion did not produce apparent abnormalities in organogenesis. Taken together, magr and cry2 exist as a single copy gene, whereas cry1 exists as multiple gene duplicates in zebrafish. Our result suggests that magr may play a dispensable role in organogenesis and predicts a possibility to generate magr mutants for analyzing its role in zebrafish.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate personality traits in patients with Alzheimer disease, compared with mentally healthy control subjects. We compared both current personality characteristics using structured interviews as well as current and previous personality traits as assessed by proxies.METHOD: Fifty-four patients with mild Alzheimer disease and 64 control subjects described their personality traits using the Structured Interview for the Five-Factor Model. Family members filled in the Revised NEO Personality Inventory, Form R, to evaluate their proxies' current personality traits, compared with 5 years before the estimated beginning of Alzheimer disease or 5 years before the control subjects.RESULTS: After controlling for age, the Alzheimer disease group presented significantly higher scores than normal control subjects on current neuroticism, and significantly lower scores on current extraversion, openness, and conscientiousness, while no significant difference was observed on agreeableness. A similar profile, though less accentuated, was observed when considering personality traits as the patients' proxies remembered them. Diachronic personality assessment showed again significant differences between the 2 groups for the same 4 domains, with important personality changes only for the Alzheimer disease group.CONCLUSIONS: Group comparison and retrospective personality evaluation are convergent. Significant personality changes follow a specific trend in patients with Alzheimer disease and contrast with the stability generally observed in mentally healthy people in their personality profile throughout their lives. Whether or not the personality assessment 5 years before the current status corresponds to an early sign of Alzheimer disease or real premorbid personality differences in people who later develop Alzheimer disease requires longitudinal studies.
The aim of the present study was to make use of the artificially induced aging model cardiomyocytes to further investigate potential anti-aging-associated cellular diastolic dysfunction effects of EGB761 and explore underlying molecular mechanisms. Cultured rat primary cardiomyocytes were treated with either D-galactose or D-galactose combined with EGB761 for 48 h. After treatment, the percentage of cells positive for SA-β-gal, AGEs production, cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium pump (SERCA) activity, the myocardial sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium uptake, and relative protein levels were measured. Our results demonstrated that in vitro stimulation with D-galactose induced AGEs production. The addition of EGB761 significantly decreased the number of cells positive for SA-β-gal. Furthermore, decreased diastolic [Ca(2+)](i), curtailment of the time from the maximum concentration of Ca(2+) to the baseline level and increased reuptake of Ca(2+) stores in the SR were also observed. In addition, the level of p-Ser16-PLN protein as well as SERCA was markedly increased. The study indicated that EGb761 alleviates formation of AGEs products on SERCA2a in order to mitigate myocardial stiffness on one hand; on other hand, improve SERCA2a function through increase the amount of Ser16 sites PLN phosphorylation, which two hands finally led to ameliorate diastolic dysfunction of aging cardiomyocytes.
The isomorphic response of Koebner can be observed not only in psoriasis, but also in other diseases, such as lichen planus and some systemic diseases including LE (lupus erythematosus) or sarcoidosis. Several clinical findings in LE skin were presented and discussed in this review. The mutually-interactive-, negative-, and internal-Koebner phenomena were introduced and discussed with some speculative views. Many forms of environmental stress on the skin were reported as provocating factors of the Koebner phenomenon, including trauma, scratching, UV-exposure, and various types of dermatitis. Clinical observations of the nature, localization, and movement of lesions should be carefully made. The pathophysiology of the Koebner phenomenon may be classified into two steps. A first non-specific inflammatory step and a second disease-specific step. The inflammatory products released from the first step would be targeted in the second step. In the first step, there could be many substances including cytokines, stress proteins, adhesion molecules, or autoantigens translocated from intra-cellular areas. In the second step after latent periods, there may be disease-specific reactions, including ones by T-cells, B-cells, autoantibodies, and immune deposits, under the restriction of genetic backgrounds. The Koebner phenomenon may prove useful in understanding the pathophysiology of diseases of unknown origin.
Multiple familial trichoepithelioma (MFT) and familial cylindromatosis are two clinically distinct cancer syndromes. MFT patients developed mostly trichoepithelioma in the face while cylindromatosis patients developed cylindromas predominantly (approximately 90%) on the head and neck. However, multiple familial trichoepithelioma is occasionally associated with familial cylindromatosis while cylindromatosis patients can also develop trichoepithelioma. This has led to the speculation that the 2 types of dermatoses may be caused by dysfunction of a common pathway. Previously, a candidate MTF locus has been mapped to 9p21 while disease gene for familial cylindromatosis, the CYLD gene located on 16q21-13 has been identified. Here, we show that mutations in the CYLD gene are also the genetic basis for three different Chinese families with MFT. Sequence analysis reveal a single nucleotide deletion, c.1462delA (P.Ile488fsX9) in exon 9, a nonsense mutation, c.2128C>T (p. Gln710X) in exon 17, and a missense mutation, c.2822A>T (p. Asp941Val) in exon 21 in each of the three families respectively. This provides direct evidence that the mutations in CYLD can cause two clinically distinct cancer syndromes.
INTRODUCTION: H1N1 influenza can cause severe acute lung injury (ALI). Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) can support gas exchange in patients failing conventional mechanical ventilation, but its role is still controversial. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on ECMO for H1N1-associated ALI.METHODS: CENTRAL, Google Scholar, MEDLINE/PubMed and Scopus (updated 2 January 2012) were systematically searched. Studies reporting on 10 or more patients with H1N1 infection treated with ECMO were included. Baseline, procedural, outcome and validity data were systematically appraised and pooled, when appropriate, with random-effect methods.RESULTS: From 1,196 initial citations, 8 studies were selected, including 1,357 patients with confirmed/suspected H1N1 infection requiring intensive care unit admission, 266 (20%) of whom were treated with ECMO. Patients had a median Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score of 9, and had received mechanical ventilation before ECMO implementation for a median of two days. ECMO was implanted before inter-hospital patient transfer in 72% of cases and in most patients (94%) the veno-venous configuration was used. ECMO was maintained for a median of 10 days. Outcomes were highly variable among the included studies, with in-hospital or short-term mortality ranging between 8% and 65%, mainly depending on baseline patient features. Random-effect pooled estimates suggested an overall in-hospital mortality of 28% (95% confidence interval 18% to 37%; I² = 64%).CONCLUSIONS: ECMO is feasible and effective in patients with ALI due to H1N1 infection. Despite this, prolonged support (more than one week) is required in most cases, and subjects with severe comorbidities or multiorgan failure remain at high risk of in-hospital death.
PURPOSE: p53 is inactivated in many human malignancies through missense mutations or overexpression of the human homologue of Mdm2 (Hdm2), an E3 ubiquitin ligase that ubiquitinates p53, thereby promoting its proteasomal degradation. The cis-imidazoline nutlin-3 can disrupt the p53-Hdm2 interaction and activate p53, inducing apoptosis in vitro in many malignancies, including multiple myeloma (MM).EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We hypothesized that suppression of Hdm2-mediated p53 ubiquitination may augment sequelae of p53 accumulation caused by proteasomal inhibition. We compared the response of MM cells versus several epithelial cancer models to the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib in combination with nutlin-3.RESULTS: The combination of sublethal concentrations of bortezomib plus nutlin-3 induced additive cytotoxicity against bortezomib-sensitive MM cell lines. Importantly, however, in breast, prostate, colon, and thyroid (papillary, follicular, anaplastic, and medullary) carcinoma cell lines, this combination triggered synergistic cytotoxicity, and increased expression of p53, p21, Hdm2, Bax, Noxa, PUMA, and cleavage of caspase-3 and poly ADP ribose polymerase. Coculture with bone marrow stromal cells attenuated MM cell sensitivity to nutlin-3 monotherapy and was associated with evidence of suppression of p53 activity in MM cells, whereas combined bortezomib-nutlin-3 treatment maintained cytotoxicity even in the presence of bone marrow stromal cells.CONCLUSIONS: This differential response of MM versus epithelial carcinomas to combination of nutlin-3 with bortezomib sheds new light on the role of p53 in bortezomib-induced apoptosis. Concurrent Hdm2 inhibition with bortezomib may extend the spectrum of bortezomib applications to malignancies with currently limited sensitivity to single-agent bortezomib or, in the future, to MM patients with decreased clinical responsiveness to bortezomib-based therapy.
The "hallmarks" of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) include proliferative, invasive, and metastatic tumor cells and an associated dense desmoplasia comprised of fibroblasts, pancreatic stellate cells, extracellular matrix, and immune cells. The oncogenically activated pancreatic epithelium and its associated stroma are obligatorily interdependent, with the resulting inflammatory and immunosuppressive microenvironment contributing greatly to the evolution and maintenance of PDAC. The peculiar pancreas-specific tumor phenotype is a consequence of oncogenes hacking the resident pancreas regenerative program, a tissue-specific repair mechanism regulated by discrete super enhancer networks. Defined as genomic regions containing clusters of multiple enhancers, super enhancers play pivotal roles in cell/tissue specification, identity, and maintenance. Hence, interfering with such super enhancer-driven repair networks should exert a disproportionately disruptive effect on tumor versus normal pancreatic tissue. Novel drugs that directly or indirectly inhibit processes regulating epigenetic status and integrity, including those driven by histone deacetylases, histone methyltransferase and hydroxylases, DNA methyltransferases, various metabolic enzymes, and bromodomain and extraterminal motif proteins, have shown the feasibility of disrupting super enhancer-dependent transcription in treating multiple tumor types, including PDAC. The idea that pancreatic adenocarcinomas rely on embedded super enhancer transcriptional mechanisms suggests a vulnerability that can be potentially targeted as novel therapies for this intractable disease.

Trifluridine/tipiracil or TAS-102 (Taiho Oncology, Lonsurf®, Princeton, NJ, USA) is a combination tablet of trifluridine, a thymidine-based nucleoside analog, and tipiracil, a thymidine phosphorylase inhibitor, in a 1:0.5 molar ratio. This drug was first approved for use in metastatic colorectal cancer patients. Recently, the U S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) have granted approval of trifluridine/tipiracil for treatment of metastatic gastric and gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma in patients following at least two lines of chemotherapy including fluoropyrimidine and platinum chemotherapy agents, as well as taxanes or irinotecan. This approval was granted after the findings from first a Phase II trial (EPOC1201) investigating trifluridine/tipiracil, and later a global Phase III trial (TAGS trial) that compared trifluridine/tipiracil vs placebo with best supportive care. Both trials primarily utilized trifluridine/tipiracil at a dose of 35 mg/m2 twice daily. In the EPOC1201 trial, the primary end point of disease control rate was greater than 50% after eight weeks of therapy. The most common grade three or four adverse event was neutropenia; additional toxicities included leukopenia, anemia, and anorexia. In the TAGS trial, overall survival in patients treated with trifluridine/tipiracil (5.7 months) was significantly improved as compared to the placebo-controlled group (3.6 months). Treatment with trifluridine/tipiracil not only did not impair quality of life but also tended to reduce the risk of deterioration of quality of life. The results of these studies along with the subsequent FDA and EMA approval have generated an important breakthrough in regard to treatment options for patients with refractory metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma.
pH-sensitive nonionic surfactant vesicles (niosomes) by polysorbate-20 (Tween-20) or polysorbate-20 derivatized by glycine (added as pH sensitive agent), were developed to deliver Ibuprofen (IBU) and Lidocaine (LID). For the physical-chemical characterization of vesicles (mean size, size distribution, zeta potential, vesicle morphology, bilayer properties and stability) dynamic light scattering (DLS), small angle X-ray scattering and fluorescence studies were performed. Potential cytotoxicity was evaluated on immortalized human keratinocyte cells (HaCaT) and on immortalized mouse fibroblasts Balb/3T3. In vivo antinociceptive activity (formalin test) and anti-inflammatory activity tests (paw edema induced by zymosan) in murine models were performed on drug-loaded niosomes. pH-sensitive niosomes were stable in the presence of 0 and 10% fetal bovine serum, non-cytotoxic and able to modify IBU or LID pharmacological activity in vivo. The synthesis of stimuli responsive surfactant, as an alternative to add pH-sensitive molecules to niosomes, could represent a promising delivery strategy for anesthetic and anti-inflammatory drugs.
The X-linked lymphocyte-regulated (Xlr) protein is a 30,000 Mr nuclear protein bearing homology with meiosis-specific proteins and expressed in late stage B lymphoid cell lines. In the present study we investigated its expression in the T lymphoid lineage. In adults, a high level of expression was detected in CD4-CD8- thymocytes. Most remarkably, the peak of Xlr expression occurred early during thymus cell ontogeny, precisely on days 14-15 of gestation, and was associated with the first wave of pre-T cell differentiation. Its onset preceded the rearrangement of TCR genes, as Xlr expression was conserved in thymus cells from RAG1(0/0) mice. The lower expression of Xlr on day 13 of fetal development, the bright Thy1+ phenotype of Xlr-positive cells, their large size, and their absence from subcapsular areas suggest that Xlr expression must be turned on within the thymus and not in prethymic precursors. From day 16 of gestation, Xlr expression decreased markedly. At birth and later, Xlr(high) cells were mostly large cells scattered throughout the cortical area. As shown by confocal microscopy, expression of Xlr closely overlapped that of SATB1, which binds special AT-rich DNA sequences associated with the nuclear matrix and plays an important regulatory role for many genes. The remarkably regulated expression of Xlr in the lymphoid cell lineage and of its homologue Xmr in the germ cell lineage suggests that they might play an important role in chromatin metabolism at critical stages of differentiation during which the genome undergoes irreversible rearrangements.
Smoking is a risk factor for complications during and after surgery, but most smokers are unable to quit before elective surgery. We tested the efficacy of bupropion in improving smoking cessation rates in this setting by enrolling 47 patients from the elective surgery waiting list in a double-blind randomised controlled trial. Patients receiving bupropion had a lower daily cigarette consumption at the time of hospital admission, median (IQR) cigarettes per day: 6 (2-7) vs. 15 (9-20), p = 0.046. They also had a reduction in end-expired carbon monoxide (p = 0.004), a known contaminant of cigarette smoke, and increased arterial oxygen saturation on pulse oximetry (p = 0.011). They were more likely to have stopped smoking at the 3-week visit (p = 0.036), but not at the 6-week visit (p = 0.25) or at the time of hospital admission for surgery (p > 0.99). This study found that smokers waiting for elective surgery are more likely to reduce or stop smoking when treated with bupropion.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the utility of ultrasonography in guiding modification of disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) and steroid therapy for inflammatory arthritis (IA) in routine clinical practice.METHODS: In this retrospective study, we analyzed DMARD and steroid use in IA patients referred to a rheumatologist-led ultrasound clinic. Power Doppler (PD) vascularity and greyscale (GS) synovial hypertrophy joint findings were categorized as positive/negative for each patient. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was used as a measure of disease activity.RESULTS: We assessed single visit data for 46 adult IA patients: 67.4% (n = 31) rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 15.2% (n = 7) psoriatic arthritis, 10.9% (n = 5) spondyloarthritis, and 6.5% (n = 3) undifferentiated IA. The mean ESR was 28.8 mm/h. Thirty-seven patients with both GS and PD ultrasound results were subsequently analyzed. All patients (n = 10) escalated and/or initiated on DMARD and 9/10 patients escalated or initiated on steroids were PD and GS positive. Six of seven patients with dose reduction and/or cessation of DMARDs and five of seven patients with dose reduction or cessation of steroids were PD negative. Of six patients who were GS positive and PD negative, three had dose reduction and/or cessation of DMARDs, while four had dose reduction of steroids; none of the six patients had DMARD/steroid escalation.CONCLUSION: By clarifying joint inflammation in an IA cohort with overall low ESR, ultrasonography of physician-selected joints can improve clinical assessment, resulting in treatment modification. Positive PD findings were particularly influential, while the clinical significance of GS positivity alone requires further investigation.
G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are cell surface receptors that detect a wide range of extracellular messengers and convey this information to the inside of cells. Extracellular calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) and ovarian cancer gene receptor 1 (OGR1) are two GPCRs that sense extracellular Ca(2+) and H(+), respectively. These two ions are key components of the interstitial fluid, and their concentrations change in an activity-dependent manner. Importantly, the interstitial fluid forms part of the microenvironment that influences cell function in health and disease; however, the exact mechanisms through which changes in the microenvironment influence cell function remain largely unknown. We show that CaSR and OGR1 reciprocally inhibit signaling through each other in central neurons, and that this is lost in their transformed counterparts. Furthermore, strong intracellular acidification impairs CaSR function, but potentiates OGR1 function. Thus, CaSR and OGR1 activities can be regulated in a seesaw manner, whereby conditions promoting signaling through one receptor simultaneously inhibit signaling through the other receptor, potentiating the difference in their relative signaling activity. Our results provide insight into how small but consistent changes in the ionic microenvironment of cells can significantly alter the balance between two signaling pathways, which may contribute to disease progression.
Here we present the development and implementation of a genome-wide reverse genetic screen in the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, that couples high-throughput strain growth, robotic RNA isolation and cDNA synthesis, and quantitative PCR to allow for a robust determination of the level of nearly any cellular RNA in the background of ~5,500 different mutants. As an initial test of this approach, we sought to identify the full complement of factors that impact pre-mRNA splicing. Increasing lines of evidence suggest a relationship between pre-mRNA splicing and other cellular pathways including chromatin remodeling, transcription, and 3' end processing, yet in many cases the specific proteins responsible for functionally connecting these pathways remain unclear. Moreover, it is unclear whether all pathways that are coupled to splicing have been identified. As expected, our approach sensitively detects pre-mRNA accumulation in the vast majority of strains containing mutations in known splicing factors. Remarkably, however, several additional candidates were found to cause increases in pre-mRNA levels similar to that seen for canonical splicing mutants, none of which had previously been implicated in the splicing pathway. Instead, several of these factors have been previously implicated to play roles in chromatin remodeling, 3' end processing, and other novel categories. Further analysis of these factors using splicing-sensitive microarrays confirms that deletion of Bdf1, a factor that links transcription initiation and chromatin remodeling, leads to a global splicing defect, providing evidence for a novel connection between pre-mRNA splicing and this component of the SWR1 complex. By contrast, mutations in 3' end processing factors such as Cft2 and Yth1 also result in pre-mRNA splicing defects, although only for a subset of transcripts, suggesting that spliceosome assembly in S. cerevisiae may more closely resemble mammalian models of exon-definition. More broadly, our work demonstrates the capacity of this approach to identify novel regulators of various cellular RNAs.
OBJECTIVE: To differentiate severe/critical coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection from multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C).METHODS: Single-center chart review comparing characteristics of children with MIS-C and 'severe/critical' COVID-19 infection. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to create predictive models for predicting MIS-C.RESULTS: Of 68 patients, 28 (41.2%) had MIS-C while 40 (58.8%) had severe/critical COVID-19 infection. MIS-C patients had a higher prevalence of fever, mucocutaneous, cardiac and gastrointestinal involvement and a lower prevalence of respiratory symptoms (P<0.05). Significantly lower hemoglobin, platelet count, serum electrolytes, and significantly elevated inflammatory and coagulation markers were observed in MIS-C cohort. Upon multivariate logistic regression, the best model included C-reactive protein (CRP), platelet count, gastrointestinal and mucocutaneus involvement and absence of respiratory involvement (performance of 0.94). CRP>40 mg/L with either platelet count <150x109 or mucocutaneous involvement had specificity of 97.5% to diagnose MIS-C.CONCLUSION: Elevated CRP, thrombocytopenia and mucocutaneous involvement at presentation are helpful in differentiating MIS-C from severe COVID-19.
Protein tyrosine kinases form a large family of signaling proteins implicated in both normal and malignant cell signaling. The aim of this study was to identify protein tyro-sine kinases that can transform hematopoietic cells to growth factor independent proliferation when constitutively activated by homodimerization. We used a modified retroviral insertion mutagenesis screen with a retroviral vector containing the homodimerization domain of ETV6 followed by an artificial splice donor site. Integration of this retroviral vector within a gene of the host genome would generate a fusion transcript containing the dimerization domain and part of the disrupted gene. Using this strategy with the IL3 dependent Ba/F3 cell line, we identified 8 different protein tyrosine kinases (Abl1, Fgfr1, Hck, Jak2, Lck, Mertk, Mst1r, Tnk1) that transformed the cells. These results characterize HCK, MERTK, MST1R and TNK1 as potential oncogenes and describe a method to identify gain-of-function fusion genes using a retroviral insertion screen.
The nerve center responsible for controlling our circadian rhythm is located in a cluster of cells known as the suprachiasmatic nucleus in the hypothalamus. Various physiological functions such as sleep, arousal, blood pressure, body temperature, and hormone secretion are regulated in a 24-hour rhythm by this circuit. Somatic cells of other organs have a peripheral clock gene and by synchronizing the rhythm of the central and peripheral clocks, it is possible to live a healthy life. Due to aging and degenerative disease, circadian rhythm gradually collapses. Factors that can contribute to this include reduced expression of the time gene associated with photo stimulation, a reduction in neurotransmitter levels, and reduced melatonin production. Biological clocks play an important role in our emotions, cognitive function, and behavior. Sleep disorders and metabolic disease related to the circadian rhythm affect metabolic and endocrine activities via the autonomic nervous system and the intestinal bacterial flora. Shift work disorder is associated with insomnia and excessive drowsiness as individuals often work during their sleeping hours. Now time management is placed at the center of our society, and it is important to evaluate the medical risk of engaging in shift work. In frontotemporal dementia (FTD), the stereotypical behaviors may be associated with time. In some patients, multiple timed behaviors occupy a considerable part of the patient's daily life. Stereotypical behaviors in FTD are often considered in contrast to obsessive-compulsive disease (OCD). Studies of OCD have found a close correlation between clinical symptoms, cognitive function, and brain function.
Overactive bladder (OAB), often accompanied by urinary incontinence, is most prevalent among the elderly, but also affects many middle-aged men and women in the US. OAB may severely impair quality of life, and its overall economic costs to society are substantial. Although antimuscarinic agents relieve OAB symptoms effectively, treatment persistence generally is low. This has been attributed in part to the occurrence of dry mouth and other anticholinergic adverse events. High plasma concentrations of N-desethyloxybutynin (DEO), an active metabolite of oxybutynin, have been identified as the major cause of anticholinergic adverse effects associated with oral oxybutynin. Transdermal formulations of oxybutynin generate much lower DEO plasma concentrations compared with oral formulations. In a placebo-controlled US Phase III study in patients with OAB, the recently approved oxybutynin topical gel (OTG) was efficacious and well tolerated. Dry mouth occurred in 6.9% of patients treated with OTG and 2.8% of patients on placebo. Incidences of other anticholinergic events were low and similar for OTG and placebo. OTG rarely caused application site skin reactions. OTG provides significant benefits to patients with OAB, particularly those who are sensitive to anticholinergic adverse effects.
Elagolix (ORILISSA™), an orally bioavailable, second-generation, non-peptide gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor antagonist, is being developed AbbVie and Neurocrine Biosciences for the treatment of reproductive hormone-dependent disorders in women. In July 2018, the US FDA approved elagolix tablets for the management of moderate to severe pain associated with endometriosis. This approval was based on positive results in two replicate phase III trials; additional phase III trials in the USA, Canada and Puerto Rico are currently evaluating elagolix as both monotherapy and in combination with low-dose hormone add-back therapy in the same indication. Elagolix with and without low-dose hormone add-back therapy is also undergoing phase III clinical development for heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids in the aforementioned locations. This article summarizes the milestones in the development of elagolix leading to its first approval for the management of moderate to severe pain associated with endometriosis.
BACKGROUND: Current cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) methods, such as late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) and oedema imaging (T2W) used to depict myocardial ischemia, have limitations. Novel quantitative T1-mapping techniques have the potential to further characterize the components of ischemic injury. In patients with myocardial infarction (MI) we sought to investigate whether state-of the art pre-contrast T1-mapping (1) detects acute myocardial injury, (2) allows for quantification of the severity of damage when compared to standard techniques such as LGE and T2W, and (3) has the ability to predict long term functional recovery.METHODS: 3T CMR including T2W, T1-mapping and LGE was performed in 41 patients [of these, 78% were ST elevation MI (STEMI)] with acute MI at 12-48 hour after chest pain onset and at 6 months (6M). Patients with STEMI underwent primary PCI prior to CMR. Assessment of acute regional wall motion abnormalities, acute segmental damaged fraction by T2W and LGE and mean segmental T1 values was performed on matching short axis slices. LGE and improvement in regional wall motion at 6M were also obtained.RESULTS: We found that the variability of T1 measurements was significantly lower compared to T2W and that, while the diagnostic performance of acute T1-mapping for detecting myocardial injury was at least as good as that of T2W-CMR in STEMI patients, it was superior to T2W imaging in NSTEMI. There was a significant relationship between the segmental damaged fraction assessed by either by LGE or T2W, and mean segmental T1 values (P < 0.01). The index of salvaged myocardium derived by acute T1-mapping and 6M LGE was not different to the one derived from T2W (P = 0.88). Furthermore, the likelihood of improvement of segmental function at 6M decreased progressively as acute T1 values increased (P < 0.0004).CONCLUSIONS: In acute MI, pre-contrast T1-mapping allows assessment of the extent of myocardial damage. T1-mapping might become an important complementary technique to LGE and T2W for identification of reversible myocardial injury and prediction of functional recovery in acute MI.
B cells play a central role in the pathogenesis in multiple sclerosis (MS), being involved in the activation of proinflammatory T cells, secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, and production of autoantibodies directed against myelin. Hence, the usage of B-cell-depleting monoclonal antibodies as therapy for autoimmune diseases including MS lay near at hand. Rituximab was the first therapeutic B-cell-depleting chimeric monoclonal antibody to be used successfully in MS. Ocrelizumab, a second-generation humanized anti-CD20 antibody, was explored in a large phase II, randomized, placebo-controlled multicentre trial in patients with relapsing-remitting disease. Compared with placebo, two doses of ocrelizumab (600 and 2000 mg on days 1 and 15) showed a pronounced effect on disease activity seen in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as gadolinium-enhanced lesions (89% and 96% relative reduction, both p < 0.001) and also had a significant effect on relapses. In exploratory analyses, both doses of ocrelizumab had better effect on gadolinium-enhanced lesions than interferon beta-1a intramuscularly that was used as a reference arm. Adverse effects were mainly infusion-related reactions, in particular during the first infusion. Serious infections occurred at similar rates in ocrelizumab and placebo-treated patients, and no opportunistic infections were reported. However, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) has been reported in patients treated with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies for other indications. Other anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies have been tested as treatments for MS, including ofatumumab that has shown beneficial results in placebo-controlled phase II trials in patients with relapsing-remitting MS. Ocrelizumab is now in phase III development for the treatment of relapsing-remitting MS, as well as primary progressive MS, and the results of ongoing clinical trials are eagerly awaited and will determine the place of ocrelizumab in the armamentarium of MS therapies.
Mammalian DNA replication initiates at multiple sites along chromosomes at different times during S phase, following a temporal replication program. The specification of replication timing is thought to be a dynamic process regulated by tissue-specific and developmental cues that are responsive to epigenetic modifications. However, the mechanisms regulating where and when DNA replication initiates along chromosomes remains poorly understood. Homologous chromosomes usually replicate synchronously, however there are notable exceptions to this rule. For example, in female mammalian cells one of the two X chromosomes becomes late replicating through a process known as X inactivation(1). Along with this delay in replication timing, estimated to be 2-3 hr, the majority of genes become transcriptionally silenced on one X chromosome. In addition, a discrete cis-acting locus, known as the X inactivation center, regulates this X inactivation process, including the induction of delayed replication timing on the entire inactive X chromosome. In addition, certain chromosome rearrangements found in cancer cells and in cells exposed to ionizing radiation display a significant delay in replication timing of >3 hours that affects the entire chromosome(2,3). Recent work from our lab indicates that disruption of discrete cis-acting autosomal loci result in an extremely late replicating phenotype that affects the entire chromosome(4). Additional 'chromosome engineering' studies indicate that certain chromosome rearrangements affecting many different chromosomes result in this abnormal replication-timing phenotype, suggesting that all mammalian chromosomes contain discrete cis-acting loci that control proper replication timing of individual chromosomes(5). Here, we present a method for the quantitative analysis of chromosome replication timing combined with fluorescent in situ hybridization. This method allows for a direct comparison of replication timing between homologous chromosomes within the same cell, and was adapted from(6). In addition, this method allows for the unambiguous identification of chromosomal rearrangements that correlate with changes in replication timing that affect the entire chromosome. This method has advantages over recently developed high throughput micro-array or sequencing protocols that cannot distinguish between homologous alleles present on rearranged and un-rearranged chromosomes. In addition, because the method described here evaluates single cells, it can detect changes in chromosome replication timing on chromosomal rearrangements that are present in only a fraction of the cells in a population.
The mechanisms by which the hereditary hemochromatosis protein, HFE, decreases transferrin-mediated iron uptake were examined. Coimmunoprecipitation studies using solubilized cell extracts demonstrated that transferrin (Tf) competed with HFE for binding to the transferrin receptor (TfR) similar to previous in vitro studies using soluble truncated forms of HFE and the TfR. At concentrations of Tf approaching those found in the blood, no differences in Tf binding to cells were detected, which is consistent with the lower binding constant of HFE for TfR versus Tf. However, cells expressing HFE still showed a decrease in Tf-mediated iron uptake at concentrations of Tf sufficient to dissociate HFE from the TfR. These results indicate that the association of HFE with TfR is not essential for its ability to lower intracellular iron stores. To test the effect of HFE on lowering intracellular iron levels independently of its association with TfR, a mutated HFE (fW81AHFE) that shows greatly reduced affinity for the TfR was transfected into tetracycline-controlled transactivator HeLa cells. HeLa cells expressing fW81AHFE behaved in a similar manner to cells expressing wild-type HFE with respect to decreased intracellular iron levels measured by iron regulatory protein gel-shift assays and ferritin levels. The results indicate that HFE can lower intracellular iron levels independently of its interaction with the TfR.
As an approach to the rational design of combination chemotherapy involving the anti-cancer DNA topoisomerase II poison etoposide (VP-16), we have studied the dynamic changes occurring in small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) cell populations during protracted VP-16 exposure. Cytometric methods were used to analyse changes in target enzyme availability and cell cycle progression in a SCLC cell line, mutant for the tumour-suppressor gene p53 and defective in the ability to arrest at the G1/S phase boundary. At concentrations up to 0.25 microM VP-16, cells became arrested in G2 by 24 h exposure, whereas at concentrations 0.25-2 microM G2 arrest was preceded by a dose-dependent early S-phase delay, confirmed by bromodeoxyuridine incorporation. Recovery potential was determined by stathmokinetic analysis and was studied further in aphidicolin-synchronised cultures released from G1/S and subsequently exposed to VP-16 in early S-phase. Cells not experiencing a VP-16-induced S-phase delay entered G2 delay dependent upon the continued presence of VP-16. These cells could progress to mitosis during a 6-24 h period after drug removal. Cells experiencing an early S-phase delay remained in long-term G2 arrest with greatly reducing ability to enter mitosis up to 24 h after removal of VP-16. Irreversible G2 arrest was delimited by the induction of significant levels of DNA cleavage or fragmentation, not associated with overt apoptosis, in the majority of cells. Western blotting of whole-cell preparations showed increases in topoisomerase II levels (up to 4-fold) attributable to cell cycle redistribution, while nuclei from cells recovering from S-phase delay showed enhanced immunoreactivity with an anti-topoisomerase II alpha antibody. The results imply that traverse of G1/S and early S-phase in the presence of a specific topoisomerase II poison gives rise to progressive low-level trapping of topoisomerase II alpha, enhanced topoisomerase II alpha availability and the subsequent irreversible arrest in G2 of cells showing limited DNA fragmentation. We suggest that protracted, low-dose chemotherapeutic regimens incorporating VP-16 are preferentially active towards cells attempting G1/S transition and have the potential for increasing the subsequent action of other topoisomerase II-targeted agents through target enzyme modulation. Combination modalities which prevent such dynamic changes occurring would act to reduce the effectiveness of the VP-16 component.
Deciphering the molecular basis of cancer is critical for developing novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. To better understand the early molecular events involving osteogenic sarcoma (OGS), we have initiated a program to identify potential tumor suppressor genes. Expression profiling of total RNA from ten normal bone cell lines and eleven OGS-derived cell lines by microarray showed 135-fold lower expression of FRZB/sFRP3 mRNA in OGS cells compared to bone cells; this down-regulation of Frzb/sFRP3 mRNA expression was found to be serum-independent. Subsequently, fourteen OGS biopsy specimens showed nine-fold down-regulation of Frzb/sFRP3 mRNA expression compared to expression in eight normal bone specimens as determined by microarray. FRZB /sFRP3 protein level was also found to be at a very low level in 4/4 OGS cell lines examined. Quantitation by RT-PCR indicated approximately 70% and approximately 90% loss of Frzb/sFRP3 mRNA expression in OGS biopsy specimens and OGS-derived cell lines respectively, compared to expression in bone (p<0.0001). Hybridization experiments of a cDNA microarray containing paired normal and tumor specimens from nineteen different organs did not show any significant difference in the level of Frzb/sFRP3 mRNA expression between the normal and the corresponding tumor tissues. Exogenous expression of FRZB/sFRP3 mRNA in two OGS-derived cell lines lacking endogenous expression of the mRNA produced abundant mRNA from the exogenous gene, eliminating degradation as a possibility for very low level of FRZB/sFRP3 mRNA in OGS specimens. Results from PCR-based experiments suggest that the FRZB/sFRP3 gene is not deleted in OGS cell lines, however, karyotyping shows gross abnormalities involving chromosome 2 (location of the FRZB gene) in five of twelve OGS-derived cell lines. Together, these data suggest a tumor-suppressive potential for FRZB/sFRP3 in OGS.
Conjoined twins are rare phenomena occurring in one in 1 in 50,000 live births. Successful surgical separation of conjoined twins is a major undertaking requiring careful planning by a multidisciplinary team. Reports of seperation of joined twins in developing countries like Nigeria are rare. Ten cases of conjoined twins were separated between 1936 and January 2003 (including the authors two new cases). There were five omphalopagus, two pygopagus, two heterpagus and one ishiopagus twins. Three underwent emergency separation with 83.3% mortality while seven underwent elective seperation with 64.3% survival. The overall mortality rate was 50%. Despite the absence of advanced technological resource selected group of conjoined twins can be successfully separated in a developing country like Nigeria. An improvement in facilities and availability of trained personnel in likely to be associated with improved outcome.
The Zika virus outbreak has captivated the attention of the global audience and information has spread rapidly and wildly through the internet and other media channels. This virus was first identified in 1947, when it was isolated from a sentinel rhesus monkey placed by British scientists working at the Yellow Fever Research Laboratory located in the Zika forest area of Uganda, hence its name, and is transmitted primarily by the mosquito vector, Aedes aegypti. The fact that the rhesus macaque is an Asian species being placed in an African forest brings to mind the possibility of rapid adaptation of the virus from an African to Asian species, an issue that has not been considered. Whether such adaptation has played any role in acquiring pathogenicity due to cross species transmission remains to be identified. The first human infection was described in Nigeria in 1954, with only scattered reports of about a dozen human infections identified over a 50-year period. It was not until 2007 that Zika virus raised its ugly head with infections noted in three-quarters of the population on the tiny island of Yap located between the Philippines and Papua New Guinea in the western Pacific Ocean, followed by a major outbreak in French Polynesia in 2013. The virus remained confined to a narrow equatorial band in Africa and Asia until 2014 when it began to spread eastward, first toward Oceania and then to South America. Since then, millions of infected individuals have been identified in Brazil, Colombia, Venezuela, including 25 additional countries in the Americas. While the symptoms associated with Zika virus infection are generally mild, consisting of fever, maculopapular rash, arthralgia and conjunctivitis, there have been reports of more severe reactions that are associated with neurological complications. In pregnant women, fetal neurological complications include brain damage and microcephaly, while in adults there have been several cases of virus-associated Guillain-Barre syndrome. The virus was until recently believed to only be transmitted via mosquitoes. But when the Zika virus was isolated from the semen specimens from a patient in Texas, this provided the basis for the recent report of possible sexual transmission of the Zika virus. Due to the neurological complications, various vectors for infection as well as the rapid spread throughout the globe, it has prompted the World Health Organization to issue a global health emergency. Various governmental organizations have recommended that pregnant women do not travel to countries where the virus is epidemic, and within the countries affected by the virus, recommendations were provided for women of childbearing age to delay pregnancy. The overall public health impact of these above findings highlights the need for a rapid but specific diagnostic test for blood banks worldwide to identify those infected and for the counseling of women who are pregnant or contemplating pregnancy. As of this date, there are neither commercially licensed diagnostic tests nor a vaccine. Because cross-reactivity of the Zika virus with dengue and Chikungunya virus is common, it may pose difficulty in being able to quickly develop such tests and vaccines. So far the most effective public health measures include controlling the mosquito populations via insecticides and preventing humans from direct exposure to mosquitoes.
Premature closure of cranial sutures (primary craniosynostosis) in children leads to characteristic skull deformities and prevents the constricted brain from growing normally. Although the cause remains unknown, several etiological factors have been cited. Recently, hypovascularity has been reported as a possible cause of craniosynostosis.METHODS: In a prospective study regional cerebral blood flow studies were carried out with 99mTc-HMPAO SPECT in seven children with craniosynostoses. Five preoperative and six postoperative studies were conducted and the results correlated with radiological and surgical findings.RESULTS: Preoperative studies revealed regional hypovascularity in the underlying cerebral hemisphere, corresponding to the fused sutures. Postoperative studies revealed disappearance of these perfusion defects in most cases, indicating normalization of perfusion following surgical decompression.CONCLUSION: This study establishes the presence of cerebral hypovascularity in craniosynostoses and suggests that early surgery and release of craniostenosis is essential to achieve optimum perfusion and brain development.
DNA methylation of cytosine nucleotides is an important epigenetic modification that occurs in most eukaryotic organisms and is established and maintained by various DNA methyltransferases together with their co-factors. There are two major categories of DNA methyltransferases: de novo and maintenance. Here, we report the isolation and functional characterization of a de novo methyltransferase, named OsDRM2, from rice (Oryza sativa L.). The full-length coding region of OsDRM2 was cloned and transformed into Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Both of these organisms expressed the OsDRM2 protein, which exhibited stochastic de novo methylation activity in vitro at CG, CHG, and CHH di- and tri-nucleotide patterns. Two lines of evidence demonstrated the de novo activity of OsDRM2: (1) a 5'-CCGG-3' containing DNA fragment that had been pre-treated with OsDRM2 protein expressed in E. coli was protected from digestion by the CG-methylation-sensitive isoschizomer HpaII; (2) methylation-sensitive amplified polymorphism (MSAP) analysis of S. cerevisiae genomic DNA from transformants that had been introduced with OsDRM2 revealed CG and CHG methylation levels of 3.92-9.12%, and 2.88-6.93%, respectively, whereas the mock control S. cerevisiae DNA did not exhibit cytosine methylation. These results were further supported by bisulfite sequencing of the 18S rRNA and EAF5 genes of the transformed S. cerevisiae, which exhibited different DNA methylation patterns, which were observed in the genomic DNA. Our findings establish that OsDRM2 is an active de novo DNA methyltransferase gene with conserved activity in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic non-host species.
Apoptosis plays a crucial role in many biological processes and pathogenesis of various malignancies and diseases of the immune system. In this paper, we described a novel method for sensitive detection of drug-induced apoptosis by using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS). The principle of this method is based on the assay of DNA fragmentation in the process of the drug-induced apoptosis. FCS is a single molecule method, and it can be used for sensitive and selective assay of DNA fragmentation without separation. We first developed a highly sensitive method for characterization of DNA fragments using a home-built FCS system and SYBR Green I as fluorescent DNA-intercalating dye, and then established a model of drug-induced apoptosis using human pancreatic cancer cells and a drug lidamycin. Furthermore, FCS method established was used to directly detect the fragmentation of DNA extracted from apoptotic cells or in the apoptotic cell lysate. In FCS assay, the single-component model and the multiple-components model were used to fit raw FCS data. The characteristic diffusion time of DNA fragments was used as an important parameter to distinguish the apoptotic status of cells. The obtained data documented that the characteristic diffusion time of DNA fragments from apoptotic cells significantly decreased with an increase of lidamycin concentration, which implied that DNA fragmentation occurred in lidamycin-induced apoptosis. The FCS results are well in line with the data obtained from flow cytometer and gel electrophoresis. Compared to current methods, the method described here is sensitive and simple, and more importantly, our detection volume is less than 1 fL, and the sample requirement can easily be reduced to nL level using a droplets array technology. Therefore, our method probably becomes a high throughput detection platform for early detection of cell apoptosis and screening of apoptosis-based anticancer drugs.
INTRODUCTION: The biologic, Ustekinumab (Stelara®, Centocor, Inc., Malvern, PA, USA), is a fully human monoclonal antibody with a high affinity for the shared p40 subunit of interleukins 12 and 23 (IL-12 and IL-23). Approved for use in treating moderate-to-severe psoriasis in 2009, there has been considerable interest in the long-term safety of ustekinumab.AREAS COVERED: This review discusses the use of ustekinumab in the treatment of psoriasis and its potential to be an effective and well-tolerated therapy. A literature search was performed for articles published through April 2013 to identify any safety concerns.EXPERT OPINION: Our results indicate that ustekinumab has demonstrated higher efficacy rates as compared to traditional therapies; and with a favorable dosing schedule and stable safety profile, patients with recalcitrant disease will now have another option for treatment.
The new information presented in Digestive Disease Week has allowed us to speculate on the future of inflammatory bowel disease. Manipulation of diet and the microbioma will probably play an increasingly important role in the treatment of this disease and, in the long term, in its prevention. Biological agents will probably be used earlier and more widely; new information on levels of biological agents, mucosal healing and new comparative studies will also allow these agents to be used in a more precise and personalized way. In addition to infliximab, adalimumab, natalizumab and certolizumab, other biological agents will be employed; among the first of these to be used will be ustekinumab, golimumab and vedolizumab. In the near future, biological agents will be used as frequently in ulcerative colitis as in Crohn's disease. New healthcare models will be developed that will progressively include greater participation among patients and nurses. The ability to predict new diagnostic and prognostic models will allow decisions to be more individualized.
To investigate the amount that radiation-induced secondary cancer would be reduced by using proton beam therapy (PBT) in place of intensity-modulated X-ray therapy (IMXT) in pediatric patients, we analyzed lifetime attributable risk (LAR) as an in silico surrogate marker of the secondary cancer after these treatments. From 242 pediatric patients with cancers who were treated with PBT, 26 patients were selected by random sampling after stratification into four categories: (i) brain, head and neck, (ii) thoracic, (iii) abdominal, and (iv) whole craniospinal (WCNS) irradiation. IMXT was replanned using the same computed tomography and region of interest. Using the dose-volume histograms (DVHs) of PBT and IMXT, the LARs of Schneider et al. were calculated for the same patient. All the published dose-response models were tested for the organs at risk. Calculation of the LARs of PBT and IMXT based on the DVHs was feasible for all patients. The means ± standard deviations of the cumulative LAR difference between PBT and IMXT for the four categories were (i) 1.02 ± 0.52% (n = 7, P = 0.0021), (ii) 23.3 ± 17.2% (n = 8, P = 0.0065), (iii) 16.6 ± 19.9% (n = 8, P = 0.0497) and (iv) 50.0 ± 21.1% (n = 3, P = 0.0274), respectively (one tailed t-test). The numbers needed to treat (NNT) were (i) 98.0, (ii) 4.3, (iii) 6.0 and (iv) 2.0 for WCNS, respectively. In pediatric patients who had undergone PBT, the LAR of PBT was significantly lower than the LAR of IMXT estimated by in silico modeling. Although a validation study is required, it is suggested that the LAR would be useful as an in silico surrogate marker of secondary cancer induced by different radiotherapy techniques.
STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine if a high score (≥ 3) on the STOP-Bang screening questionnaire for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) predicts whether obese patients are at high risk for OSA and increased risk of difficult airway.DESIGN: Prospective, questionnaire-based clinical assessment.SETTING: University-affiliated hospital.PATIENTS: 127 ASA physical status 2 and 3 patients, who were scheduled for elective bariatric surgery.INTERVENTIONS: Patients were allocated to three groups. Group 1 patients had a previous history of OSA, Group 2 patients had no history of OSA but did have a high STOP-Bang score (≥ 3), and Group 3 patients had no history of OSA but did have a low STOP-Bang score (< 3). Groups 2 and 3 only were assessed using the STOP-Bang questionnaire. After induction and intubation of the patient, an anesthesiologist who was blinded to the three study group allocations completed an airway questionnaire on the three study groups.MEASUREMENTS: The frequency of difficult airway, difficult mask ventilation with or without muscle relaxation, poor visualization of the vocal cords, difficulty in blade insertion, and difficult intubation were compared.MAIN RESULTS: The group of patients with high STOP-Bang scores (Group 2) and those patients previously diagnosed with OSA (Group1) showed a higher risk for difficult airway than the patients with low STOP-Bang scores (Group 3; P < 0.001).CONCLUSION: The STOP-Bang score may be used as an effective predictor of difficult airway in obese patients. Obese surgical patients with unknown/undiagnosed OSA status should be evaluated using the STOP-Bang questionnaire score.

At least 27 alphaviruses and 68 flaviviruses have been recognized, approximately one-third of which are medically important human pathogens. They vary widely in their basic ecology; each virus occupies a distinct ecologic niche, often with restricted geographic and biologic distribution. As shown in Tables 54-1 and 54-2, alphaviruses and flaviviruses can cause various syndromes, ranging from benign febrile illnesses to severe systemic diseases with hemorrhagic manifestations or major organ involvement. The neurotropic alphaviruses and flaviviruses can produce severe destructive central nervous system disease with serious sequelae. Several alphaviruses (chikungunya, Mayaro, and Ross River) cause painful arthritis that persists for weeks or months after the initial febrile illness. Yellow fever virus has unique hepatotropic properties that cause a clinically and pathologically distinct form of hepatitis with a hemorrhagic diathesis. The dengue viruses, which cause more human illness than all other members of their family, may produce a serious, sometimes fatal, immunopathologic disease in which shock and hemorrhage occur. Hepatitis C virus (Chapter 70) may be a flavivirus. Alphavirus is one of the two genera in the family Togaviridae; the other genus (Rubivirus) has rubella virus (Chapter 55) as its only member. Flavivirus, once classified in the Togaviridae, now constitutes one of three genera in the family Flaviviridae; the other two genera are Pestivirus and “Hepatitis C-like viruses”. Pestivirus includes animal pathogens (bovine viral diarrhea and hog cholera viruses) that are of considerable economic importance, but contains no known human pathogens. Hepatitis C virus is described in Chapter 70. All alphaviruses and flaviviruses that cause disease in humans are arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses). In the original classification scheme based on antigenic relationships, alphaviruses and flaviviruses were termed group A and group B arboviruses, respectively. Most alphaviruses and flaviviruses survive in nature by replicating alternately in a vertebrate host and a hematophagous arthropod (mosquitoes or, for some flaviviruses, ticks). Arthropod vectors acquire the viral infection by biting a viremic host, and after an extrinsic incubation period during which the virus replicates in the vector's tissues, they transmit virus through salivary secretions to another vertebrate host. Virus replicates in the vertebrate host, causing viremia and sometimes illness. The ability to infect and replicate in both vertebrate and arthropod cells is an essential quality of alphaviruses and flaviviruses. The principal vertebrate hosts for most are various species of wild mammals or birds. The natural zoonotic cycles that maintain the virus do not usually involve humans. However, a few viruses (yellow fever virus, dengue virus types 1, 2, 3 and 4 and chikungunya virus) can be transmitted in a human-mosquito-human cycle. As a result of being pathogenic for humans and capable of transmission in heavily populated areas, these viruses can cause widespread and serious epidemics. Because of their high transmission potential, these viruses are major public health problems in many tropical and subtropical regions of the world where appropriate mosquito vectors are present. Because some of these agents are dangerous human pathogens and are highly infectious, special containment and safety precautions in the laboratory are required.
Aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) deficiency is a rare pediatric neuro-metabolic disease in children. Due to the lack of an animal model, its pathogenetic mechanism is poorly understood. To study the role of AADC in brain development, a zebrafish model of AADC deficiency was generated. We identified an aadc gene homolog, dopa decarboxylase (ddc), in the zebrafish genome. Whole-mount in situ hybridization analysis showed that the ddc gene is expressed in the epiphysis, locus caeruleus, diencephalic catecholaminergic clusters, and raphe nuclei of 36-h post-fertilization (hpf) zebrafish embryos. Inhibition of Ddc by AADC inhibitor NSD-1015 or anti-sense morpholino oligonucleotides (MO) reduced brain volume and body length. We observed increased brain cell apoptosis and loss of dipencephalic catecholaminergic cluster neurons in ddc morphants (ddc MO-injected embryos). Seizure-like activity was also detected in ddc morphants in a dose-dependent manner. ddc morphants had less sensitive touch response and impaired swimming activity that could be rescued by injection of ddc plasmids. In addition, eye movement was also significantly impaired in ddc morphants. Collectively, loss of Ddc appears to result in similar phenotypes as that of ADCC deficiency, thus zebrafish could be a good model for investigating pathogenetic mechanisms of AADC deficiency in children.
Cytosolic proteins can be selectively delivered to lysosomes for degradation through a type of autophagy known as chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA). CMA contributes to intracellular quality control and to the cellular response to stress. Compromised CMA has been described in aging and in different age-related disorders. CMA substrates cross the lysosomal membrane through a translocation complex; consequently, changes in the properties of the lysosomal membrane should have a marked impact on CMA activity. In this work, we have analyzed the impact that dietary intake of lipids has on CMA activity. We have found that chronic exposure to a high-fat diet or acute exposure to a cholesterol-enriched diet both have an inhibitory effect on CMA. Lysosomes from livers of lipid-challenged mice had a marked decrease in the levels of the CMA receptor, the lysosome-associated membrane protein type 2A, because of loss of its stability at the lysosomal membrane. This accelerated degradation of lysosome-associated membrane protein type 2A, also described as the mechanism that determines the decline in CMA activity with age, results from its increased mobilization to specific lipid regions at the lysosomal membrane. Comparative lipidomic analyses revealed qualitative and quantitative changes in the lipid composition of the lysosomal membrane of the lipid-challenged animals that resemble those observed with age. Our findings identify a previously unknown negative impact of high dietary lipid intake on CMA and underscore the importance of diet composition on CMA malfunction in aging.
The development of antibody-drug conjugates composed of a cytotoxic agent and a monoclonal antibody carrier offers an important alternative to classic chemotherapy strategies. Trastuzumab deruxtecan (DS-8201a) is a next-generation antibody-drug conjugate composed of a monoclonal anti-HER2 antibody and a topoisomerase I inhibitor, an exatecan derivative (DX-8951f). DS-8201a resulted in favorable outcomes in HER2-positive heavily pretreated breast cancer patients and also had a promising efficacy in patients with HER2-negative/low-expressing disease, whose options are limited. Interestingly, a recently published phase 2 trial (NCT03248492) reported 60% overall response and 97% disease control in patients with HER2-positive disease previously treated with multiple regimens, including trastuzumab emtansine. On the basis of recent clinical trials, the US Food and Drug Administration granted accelerated approval to DS-8201a in advanced or unresectable HER2-positive breast cancer pretreated with at least two HER2-targeting treatment lines. We review all preclinical and clinical data of DS-8201a regarding breast cancer.
Thyroid hormone has many effects on the heart and cardiovascular system. Thyrotoxicosis is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, primarily due to heart failure and thromboembolism. However, the relationship between thyroid hormone excess and the cardiac complications of angina pectoris and myocardial infarction remains largely speculative. Moreover, few studies have been reported on the effect of thyroid hormone levels within normal range on coronary artery disease (CAD). Therefore we examined the association of thyroid function with coronary artery diseases in euthyroid angina patients. Total 192 subjects (mean age; 60.8 yrs) were enrolled in which coronary angiograms were performed due to chest pain. We measured free thyroxine (FT(4)), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), serum lipid levels and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels and analyzed their association with the presence of CAD. Serum FT(4) levels were higher in patients with CAD compared with the patients without CAD (1.31 +/- 0.30 vs 1.20 +/- 0.23, p = 0.006), and high FT(4) level was associated with the presence of multi-vessel disease. Multivariate analysis showed that age (odds ratio (OR) 1.04; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01-1.07, p = 0.007), hypertension (OR 2.04; 95% CI 1.06-3.90, p = 0.036) and FT(4) (OR 4.23; 95% CI 1.12-15.99, p = 0.033), were the determinants for CAD. The relative risk (RR) for CAD in highest tertile of FT(4) showed increased risk compared with the lowest tertile (RR 1.98; 95% CI 0.98-3.99, p<0.001). Our study showed that FT(4) levels were associated with the presence and the severity of CAD. Also, this study suggests that elevated serum FT(4) levels even within normal range could be a risk factor for CAD. Further studies will be necessary to confirm the relationship of thyroid function and CAD.
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) remains a challenging medical problem. The integral approach to the analysis of underlying pathogenetic processes allows identifying main symptom complexes of SLE and establishing relationship between skin lesions and activity of the disease. We examined 84 patients with SLE (84% women), their mean age was 42.3 +/- 2.3 yr duration of SLE 6.5 +/- 1.2 yr. The subacute and chronic SLE variants were diagnosed in 30 (36%) and 54 (64%) patients respectively. Grade 1 and 2-3 inflammatory process occurred in 53 (63%) and 31 (37%) patients respectively. Symptom complexes "systemic inflammation", "butterfly rash", "wrist petechiae", "enanthema of the oral mucous membrane", and other lesions were regarded as the markers of SLE activity. The relationship of lupus-cheilitis and facial erythema with polyserositis and pericarditis ("visceral pathology-cardiovascular lesions") requires instrumental examination of pericardium, pleural and abdominal cavities in the patients with the above skin symptoms for diagnostics of polyserositis. At the same time, the presence of teleangiectasia on the wrists (symptom complex "visceral pathology-renoparenchymatous lesions") requires thorough examination of the renal function. The presence of erythema at the major joints, mesh livedo, and Raynaud's syndrome (symptom complex "musculoskeletal disorders") implies specialized examination of the locomotor apparatus.
Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) are arachidonic acid metabolites produced by cytochrome P450 epoxygenases which are highly expressed in hepatocytes. The functions of EETs in hepatocytes are not well understood. In this study, we investigated the effects of 14,15-EETs treatment on the insulin signal transduction pathway in hepatocytes. We report that chronic treatment, not acute treatment, with 30 μM 14,15-EETs prevents palmitate induced insulin resistance and potentiates insulin action in cultured HepG2 hepatocytes. 14,15-EETs increase Akt phosphorylation at S473, activating Akt, in an insulin dependent manner in HepG2 cells. Under insulin resistant conditions induced by palmitate, 14,15-EETs restore the insulin response by increasing S473-phosphorylated Akt. 8,9-EETs and 11,12-EETs demonstrated similar effects to 14,15-EETs. Furthermore, 14,15-EETs potentiate insulin-suppression of gluconeogenesis in cultured H4IIE hepatocytes. To elucidate the mechanism of EETs function, we analyzed the insulin signaling factors upstream of Akt. Inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) with LY294002 attenuated the 14,15-EETs-induced activating phosphorylation of Akt. 14,15-EETs reduced palmitate-stimulated phosphorylation of IRS-1 on S312 and phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) at threonine 183 and tyrosine 185 residues. The regulation of insulin sensitivity in cultured hepatocytes by chronic 14,15-EETs treatment appears to involve the JNK-IRS-PI3K pathway. The requirement of chronic treatment with EETs suggests that the effects of EETs on insulin response may be indirect.
A host cytidine deaminase, APOBEC3G (A3G), inhibits replication of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) by incorporating into virions in the absence of the virally encoded Vif protein (Deltavif virions), at least in part by causing G-to-A hypermutation. To gain insight into the antiretroviral function of A3G, we determined the quantities of A3G molecules that are incorporated in Deltavif virions. We combined three experimental approaches-reversed-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC), scintillation proximity assay (SPA), and quantitative immunoblotting-to determine the molar ratio of A3G to HIV-1 capsid protein in Deltavif virions. Our studies revealed that the amount of the A3G incorporated into Deltavif virions was proportional to the level of its expression in the viral producing cells, and the ratio of the A3G to Gag in the Deltavif virions produced from activated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) was approximately 1:439. Based on previous estimates of the stoichiometry of HIV-1 Gag in virions (1400-5000), we conclude that approximately 7 (+/-4) molecules of A3G are incorporated into Deltavif virions produced from human PBMCs. These results indicate that virion incorporation of only a few molecules of A3G is sufficient to inhibit HIV-1 replication.
AIM: ATP-sensitive potassium channels are important regulators of insulin secretion. They consist of four sulphonylurea receptor (encoded by ABCC8) and four inwardly rectifying protein (encoded by KCNJ11) subunits. Activating ABCC8 mutations lead to decreased insulin secretion and to diabetes. Wide phenotype variability is associated with single ABCC8 mutations, ranging from transient or permanent neonatal diabetes (ND) with or without developmental delay (DEND syndrome) to very mild phenotypes. This report describes the case of a Caucasian infant diagnosed with ND at the age of 2 months due to a novel ABCC8 missense mutation.METHODS: ABCC8 was analyzed by sequence analysis. The mutation was present in the patient and her family and was found to be associated with phenotypes ranging from ND to asymptomatic impaired fasting glucose (IFG).RESULTS: A novel His863Tyr ABCC8 mutation was identified in a 2-month-old girl diagnosed with ND. After an initial insulin treatment, treatment with glibenclamide was initiated and the treatment with insulin discontinued. The same mutation was found in her father, who had been fortuitously diagnosed with diabetes and had an HbA(1c) level of 9% (74.8 mmol/mol). The patient's brother and mother both had normal fasting glucose, and were not found to be carriers of the mutation. However, the same mutation was found in her grandmother, who had been asymptomatic and discovered IFG (6.9 mmol/L) with an HbA(1c) of 6.8% (50.8 mmol/mol).CONCLUSION: This case describes a novel ABCC8 mutation and offers a further illustration of the highly variable phenotypes associated with an identical mutation present across three generations.
Toll-like receptor (TLR)4 regulates inflammation and metabolism and has been linked to the pathogenesis of heart disease. TLR4 is upregulated in diabetic cardiomyocytes, and we examined the role of TLR4 in modulating cardiac fatty acid (FA) metabolism and the pathogenesis of diabetic heart disease in nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice. Both wild-type (WT) NOD and TLR4-deficient NOD animals had increased plasma triglyceride levels after the onset of diabetes. However, by comparison, TLR4-deficient NOD mouse hearts had lower triglyceride accumulation in the early stages of diabetes, which was associated with a reduction in myeloid differentiation primary response gene (88) (MyD88), phosphorylation of p38 MAPK (phospho-p38), lipoprotein lipase (LPL), and JNK levels but increased phospho-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Oleic acid treatment in H9C2 cardiomyocytes also led to cellular lipid accumulation, which was attenuated by TLR4 small interfering RNA. TLR4 deficiency in the cells decreased FA-induced augmentation of MyD88, phospho-p38, and LPL, suggesting that TLR4 may modulate FA-induced lipid metabolism in cardiomyocytes. In addition, although cardiac function was impaired in both diabetic WT NOD and TLR4-deficient NOD animals compared with control nondiabetic mice, this deficit was less in the diabetic TLR4-deficient NOD mice, which had greater ejection fraction, greater fractional shortening, and increased left ventricular developed pressure in the early stages after the development of diabetes compared with their diabetic WT NOD counterparts. Thus, we conclude that TLR4 plays a role in regulating lipid accumulation in cardiac muscle after the onset of type 1 diabetes, which may contribute to cardiac dysfunction.
We present a unique case of crowned dens syndrome (CDS) that developed after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in a patient who presented with fever and neck pain. Administration of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs was extremely effective for relieving fever and neck pain, and in the improvement of inflammatory markers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of CDS caused by an ERCP procedure. In a patient with fever and neck pain after an ERCP procedure, CDS should be considered in the differential diagnosis.
Aortitis is defined as an inflammatory process that involves one or more layers of the aortic wall (internal elastic lamina, tunica media, and adventitia) and can be caused by multiple mechanisms. Clinical features are usually nonspecific and a high index of suspicion is required for making the diagnosis. Although noninvasive imaging studies are being increasingly used in evaluating patients for diagnosis, angiography remains the gold standard for confirming aortic involvement. When tissue is available, pathologic examination can aid in clarifying the diagnosis. Aortitis, irrespective of the underlying cause, frequently displays similar clinical, pathologic, and arteriographic features and therefore understandably presents a therapeutic and diagnostic dilemma. Whatever the cause, early identification and aggressive treatment is required in order to avert the potentially life-threatening sequelae. The treatment of aortitis is determined by the underlying cause. If diagnosed early, infectious aortitis responds to appropriate antimicrobial therapy, whereas noninfectious, immune-mediated aortitis requires immunosuppressive therapy. However, in many instances, primarily because of the delay in diagnosis, surgical intervention is necessary to treat the associated anatomic and physiologic sequelae. Less definitive and more controversial is the role of inflammation in both primary and secondary accelerated atherosclerosis of the aorta and its modality of treatment.
Drug transporters are an important part of the defense of cells against cytotoxic agents. One major group of transporters is known as multidrug resistance associated proteins (MRP; ABCC gene family). The MRPs belong to the ATP binding cassette transporter superfamily. One family member, ABCC4 (also known as MRP4) functions as a cellular efflux pump for anti-HIV drugs, such as 9-(2-phoshoenylmethoxyethyl) adenine and azido-thymidine-monophosphate, an antiviral nucleotide, ganciclovir-monophosphate, and anti-cancer agents such as thiopurines. We isolated a ABCC4 cDNA encoding a non-functional protein, owing to an insertion, and subsequently determined the ABCC4 gene structure. This analysis revealed that the insertion was attributed to two additional exons that would be predicted to produce premature termination codons (PTC) in ABCC4. The highly similar mouse Abcc4 gene also contained these exons, which were remarkable because their size and sequence identity were much higher than the overall similarity between these genes. Further, a comparison of human, monkey and rodent ABCC4 genes revealed that these same PTC-producing exons were also highly conserved in evolution. As all the ABCC4 mRNA containing these PTC exons might produce nonsense mRNA, we further tested the hypothesis that these mRNAs were targets of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). Protein synthesis inhibition selectively stabilized PTC containing ABCC4 transcripts in human, monkey and rodent cell lines. Moreover, the amount of PTC-containing ABCC4 transcripts was critically dependent upon protein synthesis, as removal of the inhibitor dramatically decreased expression, which correlated with the resumption of protein synthesis. These are the first studies to indicate that the highly conserved PTC exons of the ABCC4 gene may dictate its expression.
Gaucher's disease (GD) results from a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase and, in very rare occasions, a deficiency of its activator, the saposin C. The complexity of identification and characterization of mutations in the gene of glucocerebrosidase (GBA1) is caused by a great amount of mutated alleles, the existence of a highly homologous pseudogene and its location in a very rich zone in genes, which promotes the presence of complex alleles. Although genotype-phenotype correlations in EG are not completely established, there are a series of generalities, as the mutation c.1226A>G (N370S) is often associated with a certain degree of neuroprotection and the homozygosity for the c.1448T>C (L444P) mutation presents with neurological symptoms.
The interplay between tumor cells and their microenvironment plays a pivotal role in tumor development and progression. Although a growing body of evidence has established the importance of the tumor microenvironment, an understanding of the crosstalk between its components and cancer cells remains elusive. The pathways triggered by microenvironmental factors could modulate cancer-related gene transcription, also affecting small noncoding RNAs, microRNAs, which have emerged as key posttranscriptional regulators of gene expression, directly involved in human cancers. Although microRNAs regulate most biological mechanisms, their role in the tumor microenvironment has only recently become the focus of intense research. In this paper, we focus on the intertwined connection between the tumor microenvironment and aberrant expression of microRNAs involved in carcinogenesis. We also discuss the emerging roles of microRNAs in the tumor microenvironment as it relates to cancer progression. We conclude that microRNAs are critical for our understanding of the development of cancer, and that targeting microRNA signaling pathways in the microenvironment as well as in tumor cells opens new therapeutic avenues to the global control of cancer.
The continuous itaconic acid production from sucrose with Aspergillus terreus TKK 200-5-3 mycelium immobilized on polyurethane foam cubes was optimized in column bioreactors using statistical experimental design and empirical modelling. The highest itaconic acid product concentration calculated on the basis of the obtained model was 15.8 g l-1 in the investigated experimental area, when sucrose concentration was 13.5%, aeration rate 150 ml min-1 and residence time 178 h. From sucrose with immobilized A. terreus TKK 200-5-3 mycelium itaconic acid production was stable for at least 4.5 months in continuous column bioreactors. In comparison, using glucose as substrate and immobilized A. terreus TKK 200-5-1 mycelium as biocatalyst similar stability was obtained with higher product concentration. The omission of copper sulphate from the production medium gave the highest itaconic acid product concentration (26 g l-1) from 9% glucose with 0.25% ammonium nitrate and 0.095% magnesium sulphate.
BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death, and principal reason for the large difference in life expectancy between indigenous Māori and the non-indigenous population in New Zealand. CVD guidelines recommend that people who are at high risk or who have had previous CVD should be offered aspirin, blood pressure lowering and lipid lowering therapies. However, prescribing and adherence rates are low and CVD events remain high.AIM: To assess whether a medication strategy using a fixed dose combination pill ('polypill') could improve prescribing and adherence to recommended medications, lower blood pressure and improve lipids compared with current care over 12 months.METHODS: IMProving Adherence using Combination Therapy (IMPACT) is an open-label randomised controlled trial comparing a once-daily polypill containing four preventive medications with usual care. Six hundred participants who have had previous CVD events or are at high risk of CVD will be enrolled, including 300 Māori. Participants are identified, enrolled and prescribed either the polypill or current medications at their usual primary health care practice, with medications (including the polypill) dispensed through local community pharmacies. The polypill contains 75 mg aspirin, 40 mg simvastatin, 10mg lisinopril and either 12.5mg hydrochlorothiazide or 50mg atenolol. Primary outcomes are adherence to guidelines-recommended medications and changes in systolic blood pressure and low density lipoprotein at 12 months. Secondary outcomes include other lipids, medication dispensing, barriers to adherence, CVD and other serious adverse events, quality of life and prescriber acceptability. The trial is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry (ACTRN12606000067572).
Naturally occurring foam constituent and surfactant proteins with intriguing structures and functions are now being identified from a variety of biological sources. The ranaspumins from tropical frog foam nests comprise a range of proteins with a mixture of surfactant, carbohydrate binding and antimicrobial activities that together provide a stable, biocompatible, protective foam environment for developing eggs and embryos. Ranasmurfin, a blue protein from a different species of frog, displays a novel structure with a unique chromophoric crosslink. Latherin, primarily from horse sweat, but with similarities to salivary, oral and upper respiratory tract proteins, illustrates several potential roles for surfactant proteins in mammalian systems. These proteins, together with the previously discovered hydrophobins of fungi, throw new light on biomolecular processes at air-water and other interfaces. This review provides a perspective on these recent findings, focussing on structure and biophysical properties.
The concept of thyroid hormone (TH) analogs that retain the beneficial effects of TH excess on lipid lowering and fat metabolism, while avoiding any harmful effects on the heart, muscle, bone and other tissues, has interested scientists and physicians for several decades. While there have been many attempts to develop selective TH receptor (TR) modulators (STRMs) for safe lipid lowering, these approaches have failed consistently. This review details recent advances in the development of TRβ subtype- and liver-selective STRM analogs, and presents the results of preliminary clinical trials with one of these compounds, eprotirome (KB-2115; Karo Bio AB).
Haploinsufficiency of the NSD1 gene due to 5q35 microdeletions or intragenic mutations is the major cause of Sotos syndrome characterized by generalized overgrowth, large hands and feet with advanced bone age, craniofacial dysmorphic features, learning disability, and possible susceptibility to tumors. Here, we report on a 14-month-old boy with a reverse phenotype of Sotos syndrome due to the reciprocal duplication of the 5q35.3 region, including the NSD1 gene, detected by array CGH. The phenotype includes delayed bone age, microcephaly, seizures, and failure to thrive. Our case suggests that the gene dosage effect of the NSD1 gene is the likely cause for the reversed phenotype of Sotos syndrome in this patient.
Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a rare, acquired disorder characterized by chronic intravascular hemolysis as the primary clinical manifestation and morbidities that include anemia, thrombosis, renal impairment, pulmonary hypertension, and bone marrow failure. The prevalence of the PNH clone (from <1-100% PNH granulocytes) is approximately 16 per million, and careful monitoring is required. The average age of onset of the clinical disease is the early 30s, although it can present at all ages. PNH is caused by the acquisition of a somatic mutation of the gene phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor (PIG-A) in a multipotent hematopoietic stem cell (HSC), with clonal expansion of the mutated HSC. The mutation causes a deficiency in the synthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI). In cells derived from normal HSCs, the complement regulatory proteins CD55 and CD59 are anchored to the hematopoietic cell membrane surface via GPI, protecting the cells from complement-mediated lysis. However, in patients with PNH, these 2 proteins, along with numerous other GPI-linked proteins, are absent from the cell surface of red cells, granulocytes, monocytes, and platelets, resulting in complement-mediated intravascular hemolysis and other complications. Lysis of red blood cells is the most obvious manifestation, but as other cell lineages are also affected, this complement-mediated attack contributes to additional complications, such as thrombosis. Eculizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against the C5 complement protein, is the only effective drug therapy for PNH patients. The antibody prevents cleavage of the C5 protein by C5 convertase, in turn preventing generation of C5b-9 and release of C5a, thereby protecting from hemolysis of cells lacking the CD59 surface protein and other complications associated with complement activation. Drs. Ilene C. Weitz, Anita Hill, and Jeff Szer discuss 3 recent cases of patients with PNH.
INTRODUCTION: Cerebrolysin is a neuroprotective drug used in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke. To our knowledge, this drug has never been evaluated in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of Cerebrolysin in patients with aneurysmal SAH.METHODS: Aneurysmal SAH patients who had their aneurysm obliterated at our institution from 2007 to 2016 were retrospectively studied. Patients received Cerebrolysin treatment or standard care only (control group). Subgroup analyses were performed according to Hunt and Hess grade (good grade ≤ 2, N = 216; poor grade ≥ 3, N = 246) and treatment procedure (clip or coil).RESULTS: In good-grade patients (N = 216), clinical outcomes and mortality did not differ significantly between the control and Cerebrolysin groups. In poor-grade patients (N = 246), the mortality rate was significantly lower in the Cerebrolysin group (8.7%) than in the control group (25.4%, p = 0.006). In patients who received microsurgical clipping (N = 328), the mortality rate was significantly lower in the Cerebrolysin group (7.3%) than in the control group (18.5%, p = 0.016).CONCLUSION: Cerebrolysin injection during the acute period of SAH appeared to reduce the mortality rate, especially in poor-grade patients. This study suggests the potential of Cerebrolysin for treating aneurysmal SAH. Further studies are needed to confirm our results.
A patient is described with idiopathic Parkinson's disease and severe laryngeal stridor. Other than urinary frequency and urgency, not uncommon in this condition, and postoperative levodopa-sensitive postural hypotension, there were no features of generalized autonomic failure. The laryngeal stridor responded to levodopa therapy, and we are not aware that this has been reported previously.
The transcription factor E2F1 has a key function during S phase progression and apoptosis. It has been well-demonstrated that the apoptotic function of E2F1 involves its ability to transactivate pro-apoptotic target genes. Alternative splicing of pre-mRNAs also has an important function in the regulation of apoptosis. In this study, we identify the splicing factor SC35, a member of the Ser-Rich Arg (SR) proteins family, as a new transcriptional target of E2F1. We demonstrate that E2F1 requires SC35 to switch the alternative splicing profile of various apoptotic genes such as c-flip, caspases-8 and -9 and Bcl-x, towards the expression of pro-apoptotic splice variants. Finally, we provide evidence that E2F1 upregulates SC35 in response to DNA-damaging agents and show that SC35 is required for apoptosis in response to these drugs. Taken together, these results demonstrate that E2F1 controls pre-mRNA processing events to induce apoptosis and identify the SC35 SR protein as a key direct E2F1-target in this setting.
Herpes zoster (HZ; shingles) results from reactivation of varicella-zoster virus (VZV) after primary infection as varicella (chicken pox). It affects mainly older adults and people with immunocompromising diseases or treatments. The most common complication is postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), which has significant adverse effects on quality of life and activities of daily living. Since PHN cannot be prevented once HZ has occurred, and treatment is only modestly successful and is associated with significant side effects, the recent introduction of an effective vaccine is an important achievement. This new vaccine, which combines a single VZV glycoprotein (gE) and a multicomponent adjuvant, is superior to the previously available live attenuated VZV vaccine. The recombinant adjuvanted vaccine is remarkably effective in restoring the protective T cell-mediated immunity required to prevent HZ. Its clinical efficacy is much greater than that observed with other vaccines for older individuals affected by immune senescence, and its safety profile is very acceptable. It has been recommended in the USA and Canada for people who are 50 years of age and older. The immunogenicity and safety of this vaccine in severely immunocompromised individuals, such as after chemotherapy for malignancy, after solid organ or stem cell transplant, and in people with HIV are being studied.
Although mass spectrometry has become a powerful tool for the functional analysis of biological systems, complete proteome characterization cannot yet be achieved. Instead, the sheer complexity of living organisms demands fractionation of cellular extracts to enable more targeted analyses. Here, we introduce the concept of "fluorous proteomics," whereby specific peptide subsets from samples of biological origin are tagged with perfluorinated moieties and subsequently enriched by solid-phase extraction over a fluorous-functionalized stationary phase. This approach is extremely selective, yet can readily be tailored to enrich different subsets of peptides. Additionally, this methodology overcomes many of the limitations of traditional bioaffinity-based enrichment strategies, while enabling new affinity enrichment schemes impossible to implement with bioaffinity reagents. The potential of this methodology is demonstrated by the facile enrichment of peptides bearing particular side-chain functionalities or post-translational modifications from tryptic digests of individual proteins as well as whole cell lysates.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy, usefulness, safety, and dosages of flumazenil required when flumazenil is used in the diagnosis of benzodiazepine-induced coma (vs. other drug-induced coma), and to reverse or prevent the recurrence of unconsciousness.DESIGN: A two-phase study: a controlled, randomized, double-blind study followed by a prospective, open study.SETTING: An 800-bed, teaching, university-affiliated hospital.PATIENTS: Unconscious patients (n = 110) suspected of benzodiazepine overdose, graded 2 to 4 on the Matthew and Lawson coma scale, were treated with flumazenil, the specific benzodiazepine receptor antagonist. The first 31 patients were studied in a double-blind fashion, while the rest of the patients were given flumazenil according to an open protocol. INTERVENTIONS; All patients received supplemental oxygen; endotracheal intubation was performed, and synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation was initiated whenever it was deemed necessary. A peripheral intravenous cannula was inserted, as were indwelling arterial and urinary bladder catheters. Blood pressure, electrocardiogram, respiratory rate, end-tidal CO2, and core temperature were continuously monitored. The first 31 double-blind patients received either intravenous flumazenil (to a maximum of 1 mg) or saline, while the rest of the patients were given flumazenil until either regaining consciousness or a maximum of 2.5 mg was injected. Patients remaining unconscious among double-blind patients or those patients relapsing into coma after the first dose were later treated in the open phase of the study. Treatment continued by boluses or infusion as long as efficacious.MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Fourteen of 17 double-blind, flumazenil-treated patients woke after a mean of 0.8 +/- 0.3 (SD) mg vs. one of 14 placebo patients (p < .001). Seventy-five percent of the aggregated controlled and uncontrolled patients awoke from coma scores of 3.1 +/- 0.6 to 0.4 +/- 0.5 (p < .01) after the injection of 0.7 +/- 0.3 mg of flumazenil. These patients had high benzodiazepine serum blood concentrations. Twenty-five percent of the patients did not regain consciousness. These patients had very high serum concentrations of nonbenzodiazepine drugs. Sixty percent of the responders who had primarily ingested benzodiazepines remained awake for 72 +/- 37 mins after flumazenil administration; 40% relapsed into coma after 18 +/- 7 mins and various central nervous system depressant drugs were detected in their blood in addition to benzodiazepines. Seventy-one percent of the patients had ingested tricyclic antidepressants. Seventy-eight percent of the responders were continually and efficaciously treated for < or = 8 days. Fourteen (25%) of the intubated patients were extubated safely while 12 patients, who had shown increased respiratory insufficiency, resumed satisfactory respiration after flumazenil injection. Five cases of transient increase in blood pressure and heart rate were encountered. There were 27 mildly unpleasant "waking" episodes, such as anxiety, restlessness, and aggression, but no patient had benzodiazepine withdrawal signs, convulsions, or dysrhythmia, most noticeably absent in tricyclic antidepressant-intoxicated patients.CONCLUSIONS: Flumazenil is a valid diagnostic tool for distinguishing pure benzodiazepine from mixed-drug intoxication or nondrug-induced coma. Flumazenil is effective in preventing recurrence of benzodiazepine-induced coma. Respiratory insufficiency is reversed after its administration. Flumazenil is safe when administered cautiously, even in patients with coma caused by a mixed overdose of benzodiazepine plus tricyclic antidepressants.
Over the past 20 years, great progress has been made in the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Available therapies target one of three principal pathways: the endothelin (ET), nitric oxide (NO) or the prostacyclin (PGI2) pathway. Evidence shows that current drugs, used either as monotherapy or in different combinations, can improve exercise capacity, clinical symptoms, hemodynamics and even survival in PAH. Unfortunately, the disease remains incurable and the prognosis of the disease is still poor. However, existing and novel potent antiproliferative therapies are being explored, and new agents targeting different and/or additional pathways are likely to become available to clinicians in the near future. Promising candidates include tyrosine kinase antagonists (e.g. imatinib); soluble guanylate cyclase stimulators (riociguat); an oral analog of prostacyclin (selexipag); and a tissue targeting endothelin receptor antagonist (macitentan). Phase II or III trials have either been completed or are underway to evaluate the safety and efficacy of these various therapies.
The Currarino triad is a unique complex of congenital caudal anomalies, including anorectal malformation, sacral bony defect and presacral mass. This triad may be associated with Müllerian duct anomalies, such as duplication of the vagina and uterus. Each of these diseases has a familial tendency and sometimes coexist within families. But, when coexisting in familial cases, nearly all reported cases revealed mutations of the motor neuron and pancreas homeobox 1 (MNX1) gene. Familial cases of Currarino triad combined with Müllerian duct anomaly without MNX1 gene mutation are very rare. Here we report cases of mother and daughter, who had Currarino triad and Müllerian duct anomaly without MNX1 gene mutation, along with a brief literature review.
Ultraviolet light induced pyrimidine dimers in DNA are recognized and repaired by a number of unique cellular surveillance systems. At the highest level of complexity Escherichia coli (E. coli) has a uvr DNA repair system comprising the UvrA, UvrB and UvrC proteins responsible for incision. There are several preincision steps governed by this pathway which includes an ATP-dependent UvrA dimerization reaction required for UvrAB nucleoprotein formation. This complex formation driven by ATP binding, is associated with localized topological unwinding of DNA. This protein complex can catalyze an ATP-dependent 5'----3' directed strand displacement of D-loop DNA or short single strands annealed to a single stranded circular or linear DNA. This putative translocational process is arrested when damaged sites are encountered. The complex is now primed for dual incision catalyzed by UvrC. The remainder of the repair process involves UvrD (helicase II) and DNA polymerase I for a coordinately controlled "excision resynthesis" step accompanied by UvrABC turnover. Furthermore, it is proposed that levels of repair proteins can be regulated by proteolysis. UvrB is converted to truncated UvrB* by a stress induced protease which also acts at similar sites on the E. coli Ada protein. Although UvrB* can bind with UvrA to DNA it cannot participate in helicase or incision reactions. It is also a DNA-dependent ATPase.
A retrospective study was performed to collect information regarding efficacy and toxicity of cidofovir (CDV) in allogeneic stem cell transplant patients. Data were available on 82 patients. The indications for therapy were cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease in 20 patients, primary preemptive therapy in 24 patients, and secondary preemptive therapy in 38 patients. Of the patients, 47 had received previous antiviral therapy with ganciclovir, foscarnet, or both drugs. The dosage of CDV was 1 to 5 mg/kg per week followed by maintenance every other week in some patients. The duration of therapy ranged from 1 to 134 days (median, 22 days). All patients received probenecid and prehydration. Ten of 20 (50%) patients who were treated for CMV disease (9 of 16 with pneumonia) responded to CDV therapy, as did 25 of 38 (66%) patients who had failed or relapsed after previous preemptive therapy and 15 of 24 (62%) patients in whom CDV was used as the primary preemptive therapy. Of the patients, 21 (25.6%) developed renal toxicity that remained after cessation of therapy in 12 patients. Fifteen patients developed other toxicities that were potentially due to CDV or the concomitantly given probenecid. No toxicity was seen in 45 (61.6%) patients. Cidofovir can be considered as second-line therapy in patients with CMV disease failing previous antiviral therapy. However, additional studies are needed before CDV can be recommended for preemptive therapy.
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common CNS-demyelinating disease of humans, showing clinical and pathological heterogeneity and a general resistance to therapy. We first discovered that abnormal myelin hypercitrullination, even in normal-appearing white matter, by peptidylarginine deiminases (PADs) correlates strongly with disease severity and might have an important role in MS progression. Hypercitrullination is known to promote focal demyelination through reduced myelin compaction. Here we report that 2-chloroacetamidine (2CA), a small-molecule, PAD active-site inhibitor, dramatically attenuates disease at any stage in independent neurodegenerative as well as autoimmune MS mouse models. 2CA reduced PAD activity and protein citrullination to pre-disease status. In the autoimmune models, disease induction uniformly induced spontaneous hypercitrullination with citrulline+ epitopes targeted frequently. 2CA rapidly suppressed T cell autoreactivity, clearing brain and spinal cord infiltrates, through selective removal of newly activated T cells. 2CA essentially prevented disease when administered before disease onset or before autoimmune induction, making hypercitrullination, and specifically PAD enzymes, a therapeutic target in MS models and thus possibly in MS.
thi1 has been recently isolated from Arabidopsis thaliana and is probably involved in both thiamine biosynthesis and as protection of organellar DNA from damage. Studies of thiamine biosynthesis in plants suggests a plastid location for the pathway, which is in agreement with the predicted THI1 N-terminal chloroplastic transit peptide (TP). On the other hand, thiamine is synthesized in mitochondria in yeast cells. Interestingly, A. thaliana thi1 cDNA complements a yeast strain disrupted for the homologous gene. Analysis of THI1 amino acid sequence revealed the presence of a putative amphiphilic alpha-helix, which is typical for mitochondrial presequences, located downstream of the chloroplast transit peptide. To define the putative role of the two predicted targeting sequences in tandem, we produced two chimeric genes encompassing the chloroplastic THI1 TP and either 4 or 27 (including the putative mitochondrial presequence) N-terminal residues of the mature THI1, both linked to the reporter (gusA) gene. Analysis of GUS distribution in subcellular fractions of transgenic plants revealed that in the construct retaining only 4 residues of mature THI1, GUS was found in the chloroplastic fraction. Extension of the THI1 transit peptide to 27 residues of the mature protein allowed import and processing of GUS into both mitochondria and chloroplasts. Direct analysis by immunogold-labeling with an anti-THI1 polyclonal antibody identified THI1 in both organelles in Arabidopsis. We also provide evidence that the precursors of both organellar isoforms are encoded by a single nuclear transcript. Thus, THI1 is targeted simultaneously to mitochondria and chloroplasts by a post transcriptional mechanism.
This article presents the design and applications of a rescue terminal with positioning, vital signs sensing, and communicating function for special environment. The terminal provides three-dimensional positioning functionality via China's Beidou 1 Navigation Satellite (BD1) System and can collect users' vital signs with a set of wireless sensors. A controller of the terminal is in charge of processing data collected from the wireless sensors and communicating with the monitoring platform. With features such as small sizing, low power consumption, and accurate positioning, this terminal is very helpful in special circumstances such as disaster relief, dangerous outdoor sports and adventure monitoring, and antiterrorism activities.
Extracting protein-protein interaction (PPI) from biomedical literature is an important task in biomedical text mining (BioTM). In this paper, we propose a hash subgraph pairwise (HSP) kernel-based approach for this task. The key to the novel kernel is to use the hierarchical hash labels to express the structural information of subgraphs in a linear time. We apply the graph kernel to compute dependency graphs representing the sentence structure for protein-protein interaction extraction task, which can efficiently make use of full graph structural information, and particularly capture the contiguous topological and label information ignored before. We evaluate the proposed approach on five publicly available PPI corpora. The experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms all-path kernel approach on all five corpora and achieves state-of-the-art performance.
CpG islands are short, dispersed regions of unmethylated DNA with a high frequency of CpG dinucleotides relative to the bulk genome. We have analyzed 375 genes and 58 pseudogenes from the human entries in the EMBL Database for the presence of CpG islands. All 240 islands identified are associated with genes, and almost all cover at least a part of one exon; i.e., they are useful landmarks in the genome for identifying genes. More than half of the genes analyzed were associated with islands. All housekeeping and widely expressed genes have a CpG island covering the transcription start, whereas 40% of the genes with a tissue-specific or limited expression are associated with islands. In this latter group of genes, the position of the islands was not biased toward the 5' end of the transcription unit.
Significant increases in the concentration of plasma glucagon-like immunoreactivity (GLI) and plasma levels of free fatty acids (FFA) and triglycerides (TG) concomitant with decreases in circulating levels of thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) and T3/T4 ratio were observed in homing pigeons, untrained for 3 months, after a flight of 48 km lasting 90-160 min. The increased level of FFA is attributed to glucagon stimulated lipolysis. The elevation of TG levels may be due to altered partitioning and utilization of lipoprotein in adipose tissue and muscle. Reductions in plasma T4, T3 and T3/T4 ratio are probably due to inhibition of T4 secretion and 5'-monodeiodination with possible conversion of T4 to reverse T3 (rT3). These processes may represent a mechanism for regulation of thyroid hormone metabolism during strenuous and extended flight.
RATIONALE: BRAF and MEK inhibitors have significantly improved the prognosis of metastatic melanoma, by inhibiting both the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP-kinase) pathway. They are associated with infrequent adverse kidney events. Most of these are related to the use of BRAF inhibitors and involve interstitial nephritis with acute tubular necrosis.PATIENT CONCERNS: We report a unique case of glomerulonephritis with renal granulomatous vasculitis in a patient diagnosed with metastatic melanoma treated with BRAF and MEK inhibitors. The patient was a 55-year old woman, who presented a melanoma of the right thigh with pulmonary metastasis. Treatment started in November 2015, with Encorafenib and Binimetinib, new BRAF and MEK inhibitors, respectively. Two months after the beginning of the treatment, there was a worsening of her renal function with significant proteinuria.DIAGNOSES: Kidney biopsy showed extracapillary proliferation in the glomeruli with a granulomatous reaction.INTERVENTIONS AND OUTCOMES: Renal function recovered completely after withdrawal of the chemotherapy.LESSONS: All the reported kidney adverse events secondary to BRAF and MEK inhibitors in the literature are related to the use of BRAF inhibitors. Some previous reported mechanistic investigations also provide insight between BRAF inhibitors and podocytes injuries. Therefore, encorafenib most likely is the main responsible of the disease. However, evidence has emerged that inhibition of the MAP kinase pathway could also enhance autoimmunity. Thus, binimetinib may also have played a role and the combination of BRAF and MEK inhibitors may have facilitated this autoimmune kidney disease.
BACKGROUND: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex multi-system disease, characterized by both autoimmune and autoinflammatory clinical and laboratory features. The role of type I interferon (IFN) in SLE has been demonstrated from the 2000s, by gene expression analyses showing significant over-expression of genes related to type I IFN signalling pathway (IFN signature). However, several studies questioned the role of measuring the intensity of IFN signature (IFN score) to chase SLE activity. We would assess if the IFN signature can help the clinical and therapeutic stratification of patients with pediatric SLE.METHODS: We measured the IFN score in peripheral whole blood from a series of subjects with childhood-onset SLE and correlated the results with clinical and laboratory parameters.RESULTS: Thirty-one subjects were included in the study, among which the 87% displayed a positive IFN score. The only significant relation was found for high IFN score in subjects with normocomplementemia. No correlation was observed between IFN score and SLEDAI-2K, BILAG-2004 and SLICC. Patients with high IFN score and normal complement levels also presented lower anti-dsDNA antibodies.CONCLUSIONS: The integration between IFN signature analysis and complement levels may easily distinguish two groups of subjects, in which the autoimmune or autoinflammatory component of the disease seems to be prevalent.
The embryonic outflow tract is a simple tubular structure that connects the single primitive ventricle with the aortic sac and aortic arch arteries. This structure undergoes a complex sequence of morphogenetic processes to become the portion of the heart that aligns the right and left ventricles with the pulmonary artery and aorta. Abnormalities of the outflow tract are involved in many clinically significant congenital cardiac defects; however, the cellular and molecular processes governing the development of this important structure are incompletely understood. Histologic and tissue-tagging studies indicate that the outflow tract tissues compact and are incorporated predominantly into a region of the right ventricle. The hypothesis tested in the current study was that cell death or apoptosis in the muscular portion of the outflow tract is an important cellular mechanism for outflow tract shortening. The tubular outflow tract myocardium was specifically marked by infecting myocytes of the chicken embryo heart with a recombinant replication-defective adenovirus expressing beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. Histochemical detection of the beta -gal-labeled outflow tract myocytes revealed that the tubular structure shortened to become a compact ring at the level of the pulmonic infundibulum over several days of development (stages 25-32, embryonic days 4-8). The appearance of apoptotic cardiomyocytes was correlated with OFT shortening by two histologic assays, TUNEL labeling of DNA fragments and AnnexinV binding. The rise and fall in the number of apoptotic myocytes detected by histologic analyses paralleled the change in activity levels of Caspase-3, a protease in the apoptotic cascade, measured in outflow tract homogenates. These results suggest that the elimination of myocytes by programmed cell death is one mechanism by which the outflow tract myocardium remodels to form the proper connection between the ventricular chambers and the appropriate arterial trunks.
Diffusely infiltrating gliomas are inherently heterogeneous tumors, and there are ongoing efforts to establish a classification scheme that incorporates new molecular and traditional histologic features. In less than a decade, high-throughput sequencing of gliomas has transformed the field, uncovering several pivotal, highly prevalent genetic alterations that stratify patients into different prognostic and treatment-response categories. We highlight the genetic aberrations recently discovered in isocitrate dehydrogenase, alpha thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked, death-domain-associated protein, histone H3.3, and telomerase reverse transcriptase and discuss how these mutations lead to unexpected changes in the epigenetic landscape in gliomas. We describe the opportunities these discoveries might provide for the development of novel targeted therapy aimed at reversing early epigenetic aberrations in glioma precursor cells. Finally, we discuss the challenges for effective treatment of this fatal disease posed by intratumoral heterogeneity and clonal evolution.
The type II iodothyronine deiodinase (D2) is a type I endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident thioredoxin fold-containing selenoprotein that activates thyroid hormone. D2 is inactivated by ER-associated ubiquitination and can be reactivated by two ubiquitin-specific peptidase-class D2-interacting deubiquitinases (DUBs). Here, we used D2-expressing cell models to define that D2 ubiquitination (UbD2) occurs via K48-linked ubiquitin chains and that exposure to its natural substrate, T4, accelerates UbD2 formation and retrotranslocation to the cytoplasm via interaction with the p97-ATPase complex. D2 retrotranslocation also includes deubiquitination by the p97-associated DUB Ataxin-3 (Atx3). Inhibiting Atx3 with eeyarestatin-I did not affect D2:p97 binding but decreased UbD2 retrotranslocation and caused ER accumulation of high-molecular weight UbD2 bands possibly by interfering with the D2-ubiquitin-specific peptidases binding. Once in the cytosol, D2 is delivered to the proteasomes as evidenced by coprecipitation with 19S proteasome subunit S5a and increased colocalization with the 20S proteasome. We conclude that interaction between UbD2 and p97/Atx3 mediates retranslocation of UbD2 to the cytoplasm for terminal degradation in the proteasomes, a pathway that is accelerated by exposure to T4.
Measuring neuro-haemodynamic correlates in the brain of epilepsy patients using EEG-fMRI has opened new avenues in clinical neuroscience, as these are two complementary methods for understanding brain function. In this study, we investigated three patients with drug-resistant reflex epilepsy using EEG-fMRI. Different types of reflex epilepsy such as eating, startle myoclonus, and hot water epilepsy were included in the study. The analysis of EEG-fMRI data was based on the visual identiﬁcation of interictal epileptiform discharges on scalp EEG. The convolution of onset time and duration of these epilepsy spikes was estimated, and using these condition-specific effects in a general linear model approach, we evaluated activation of fMRI. Patients with startle myoclonus epilepsy experienced epilepsy in response to sudden sound or touch, in association with increased delta and theta activity with a spike-and-slow-wave pattern of interictal epileptiform discharges on EEG and fronto-parietal network activation pattern on SPECT and EEG-fMRI. Eating epilepsy was triggered by sight or smell of food and fronto-temporal discharges were noted on video-EEG (VEEG). Similarly, fronto-temporo-parietal involvement was noted on SPECT and EEG-fMRI. Hot water epilepsy was triggered by contact with hot water either in the bath or by hand immersion, and VEEG showed fronto-parietal involvement. SPECT and EEG fMRI revealed a similar fronto-parietal-occipital involvement. From these results, we conclude that continuous EEG recording can improve the modelling of BOLD changes related to interictal epileptic activity and this can thus be used to understand the neuro-haemodynamic substrates involved in reflex epilepsy.
This pilot study examined gene expression signatures in pathological gingival tissues of subjects with chronic or aggressive periodontitis, and explored whether new subclasses of periodontitis can be identified based on gene expression profiles. A total of 14 patients, seven with chronic and seven with aggressive periodontitis, were examined with respect to clinical periodontal status, composition of subgingival bacterial plaque assessed by checkerboard hybridizations, and levels of serum IgG antibodies to periodontal bacteria assayed by checkerboard immunoblotting. In addition, at least two pathological pockets/patient were biopsied, processed for RNA extraction, amplification and labeling, and used to study gene expression using Affymetrix U-133 A arrays. Based on a total of 35 microarrays, no significantly different gene expression profiles appeared to emerge between chronic and aggressive periodontitis. However, a de novo grouping of the 14 subjects into two fairly robust clusters was possible based on similarities in gene expression. These two groups had similar clinical periodontal status and subgingival bacterial profiles, but differed significantly with respect to serum IgG levels against the important periodontal pathogens Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythensis and Campylobacter rectus. These early data point to the usefulness of gene expression profiling techniques in the identification of subclasses of periodontitis with common pathobiology.
Pyroptosis is a type of programmed lytic cell death that could be activated by either the canonical or noncanonical inflammasome pathway. In this study, we aimed to examine the effect of hypertonic solution on noncanonical pyroptosis in macrophage. We found that although hypertonic solution had a general inhibitory effect on noncanonical pyroptosis, the underlying mechanism varied by the solute causing hypertonicity. Specifically, hypertonic NaCl or KCl solution inhibited the cleavage of gasdermin D, the pore-forming protein in pyroptosis, whereas hypertonic saccharide solution did not affect the cleavage or membrane binding of gasdermin D. In this case, nevertheless, pyroptosis was still inhibited as evidenced by the preserved mitochondria activity and cell membrane permeability.
Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles released to the extracellular milieu through fusion of multivesicular bodies with the plasma membrane. These vesicles contain microRNAs and might therefore be vehicles transferring genetic information between cells. The aim of this study was to investigate whether there was a sorting of microRNAs into exosomes in the prostate cancer cell line PC-3. In addition, microRNAs in PC-3 cells and in the non-cancerous prostate cell line RWPE-1 were compared. Exosomes were isolated from the conditioned media from PC-3 cells by ultracentrifugation and inspected by electron microscopy. Total RNA was isolated and microRNAs were analyzed by microarray analysis and real time RT-PCR. MicroRNA microarray analysis revealed that the microRNA profile of PC-3 released exosomes was similar to the profile of the corresponding parent cells. Nevertheless, a sorting of certain microRNAs into exosomes was observed, and low number microRNAs (microRNAs with a low number in their name) were found to be underrepresented in these vesicles. Moreover, the miRNA profile of PC-3 cells resembled the miRNA profile of RWPE-1 cells, though some miRNAs were found to be differently expressed in these cell lines. These results show that exosomes from PC-3 cells, in agreement with previous reports from other cell types, contain microRNAs. Furthermore, this study supports the idea that there is a sorting of microRNAs into exosomes and adds a new perspective by pointing at the underrepresentation of low number miRNAs in PC-3 released exosomes.
Chronic infection may increase the risk for ischemic stroke. Presently, it is insufficiently established whether Helicobacter pylori infection represents a risk factor for ischemic stroke. We analyzed IgG antibodies against H. pylori in 109 patients with acute cerebral ischemia and 82 age- and sex-matched control patients with non-vascular and non-inflammatory neurological diseases. Antibody titers were significantly higher in patients than in control subjects (p=0.007). H. pylori seropositivity tended to be more common in patients (odds ratio (OR) 1.55, 95% confidence interval (ci) 0.87-2.76), but this trend was further attenuated in multivariate analysis (OR 1.42; 95% 0.75-2.67) with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, current or previous smoking, previous cerebral ischemia and low socioeconomic status. H. pylori seropositivity increased the odds for cerebral ischemia of atherothrombotic origin in univariate (OR 3.63; 95% ci 1.37-9.65) and multivariate analysis (OR 3.53; 95% ci 1.09-11.4). H. pylori seropositivity may be an independent risk factor for stroke of atherothrombotic origin.
1. The synaptic activation by mossy fibers (MFs) of unipolar brush cells (UBCs) in the vestibular cerebellum (nodulus and uvula) was examined using patch-clamp recording methods in thin, rat cerebellar slices with Lucifer yellow-filled pipettes for subsequent fluorescence microscopic verification of the cell morphology. 2. UBCs were distinguished from adjacent granule cells in thin cerebellar slices in the uvula and nodulus regions by their larger soma diameters and short dendritic brush, greater whole-cell capacitance, and a prolonged, biphasic excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) to stimulation of MFs. 3. Thin-section transmission electron micrographs of the MF-UBC synapse displayed an unusually extensive area of synaptic apposition estimated to measure 12-40 microns2. The majority of UBCs was innervated by a single MF. At high magnification, individual clusters of presynaptic vesicles could be discerned, separated by regions of presynaptic membrane lacking vesicles, but apposed to continuous regions of postsynaptic density. Thus, after release, transmitter diffusion from the synaptic cleft must traverse considerable stretches of postsynaptic membrane before escape into extracellular space. In contrast, MF-granule cell synapses in these cerebellar regions resembled glutamate synapses in other brain regions in that the total synaptic area measured < or = 4 microns2. These synaptic junctions were flanked by short stretches of unspecialized plasma membrane, providing a short (0.5 micron) diffusional path from the site of neurotransmitter release to a branch point of the extracellular space. 4. The MF-evoked EPSC in UBCs was composed of a fast (10-90% rise time: 0.70 ms) and slow (10-90% rise time: 395 ms; 10-90% decay time: 3.1 s) component. The fast component was blocked by the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid/kainate (AMPA/KA) antagonist 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (10 microM) and displayed linear current-voltage (I-V) relations in the presence or absence of external magnesium. 5. The slow EPSC was also mediated by glutamate receptors, but in most neurons both AMPA/KA and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors contributed to the slow EPSC, with the contribution of NMDA receptors predominating in the majority of cells. Consequently, although all cells displayed linear I-V relations in Mg(2+)-free saline, cells in which the slow EPSC was predominently mediated by NMDA receptors exhibited voltage-dependent rectification in the presence of external Mg2+ (1 mM). 6. With increasing postnatal age (10-30 d), the contribution made to the slow EPSC by NMDA receptors declined, with a reciprocal increase in the contribution being made by AMPA/KA receptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
Fluorescent Timer, or DsRed1-E5, is a mutant of the red fluorescent protein, dsRed, in which fluorescence shifts over time from green to red as the protein matures. This molecular clock gives temporal and spatial information on protein turnover. To visualize mitochondrial turnover, we targeted Timer to the mitochondrial matrix with a mitochondrial-targeting sequence (coined "MitoTimer") and cloned it into a tetracycline-inducible promoter construct to regulate its expression. Here we report characterization of this novel fluorescent reporter for mitochondrial dynamics. Tet-On HEK 293 cells were transfected with pTRE-tight-MitoTimer and production was induced with doxycycline (Dox). Mitochondrial distribution was demonstrated by fluorescence microscopy and verified by subcellular fractionation and western blot analysis. Dox addition for as little as 1 h was sufficient to induce MitoTimer expression within 4 h, with persistence in the mitochondrial fraction for up to 6 d. The color-specific conformation of MitoTimer was stable after fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde. Ratiometric analysis of MitoTimer revealed a time-dependent transition from green to red over 48 h and was amenable to analysis by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry of whole cells or isolated mitochondria. A second Dox administration 48 h after the initial induction resulted in a second round of expression of green MitoTimer. The extent of new protein incorporation during a second pulse was increased by administration of a mitochondrial uncoupler or simvastatin, both of which trigger mitophagy and biogenesis. MitoTimer is a novel fluorescent reporter protein that can reveal new insights into mitochondrial dynamics within cells. Coupled with organelle flow cytometry, it offers new opportunities to investigate mitochondrial subpopulations by biochemical or proteomic methods.
INTRODUCTION: A hallmark of systemic autoimmune diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is the increased expression of interferon (IFN) type I inducible genes, so-called IFN type I signature. Recently, T-helper 17 subset (Th17 cells), which produces IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-21, and IL-22, has been implicated in SLE. As CCR6 enriches for Th17 cells, we used this approach to investigate whether CCR6⁺ memory T-helper cells producing IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-21, and/or IL-22 are increased in SLE patients and whether this increase is related to the presence of IFN type I signature.METHODS: In total, 25 SLE patients and 15 healthy controls (HCs) were included. SLE patients were divided into IFN type I signature-positive (IFN⁺) (n = 16) and negative (IFN⁻) (n = 9) patients, as assessed by mRNA expression of IFN-inducible genes (IFIGs) in monocytes. Expression of IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-21, and IL-22 by CD4⁺CD45RO⁺CCR6⁺ T cells (CCR6⁺ cells) was measured with flow cytometry and compared between IFN⁺, IFN⁻ patients and HCs.RESULTS: Increased percentages of IL-17A and IL-17A/IL-17F double-producing CCR6⁺ cells were observed in IFN⁺ patients compared with IFN⁻ patients and HCs. IL-17A and IL-17F expression within CCR6⁺ cells correlated significantly with IFIG expression. In addition, we found significant correlation between B-cell activating factor of the tumor necrosis family (BAFF)-a factor strongly correlating with IFN type I - and IL-21 producing CCR6⁺ cells.CONCLUSIONS: We show for the first time higher percentages of IL-17A and IL-17A/IL-17F double-producing CCR6⁺ memory T-helper cells in IFN⁺ SLE patients, supporting the hypothesis that IFN type I co-acts with Th17 cytokines in SLE pathogenesis.
In situ hybridization was used to measure the expression of members of the Fos/Jun family of immediate-early genes in hypothalamic neurons in vivo following defined stimuli that utilize different afferent pathways. Only c-jun messenger RNA was expressed in the hypothalamic supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of control animals. Intravenous infusions of sodium chloride solutions of different tonicity produced a range of plasma osmolalities within physiological limits. While the induction of c-fos and jun B messenger RNAs followed the stimulus intensity, the expression of c-jun was repressed at low levels of stimulation. A higher level of osmotic stimulation was able to co-induce c-jun with the c-fos, jun B and fos B genes, suggesting that other signalling pathways may then be activated. Parturition or systemic administration of cholecystokinin, that activate supraoptic and paraventricular neurons via ascending afferent pathways from the brainstem, both induced c-fos, but not the other genes, in the magnocellular nuclei. Use of double in situ hybridization confirmed that, unlike with osmotic stimulation, induction of c-fos only occurred in oxytocin neurons. These two stimuli did not cause a concomitant repression of c-jun messenger RNA expression in magnocellular oxytocin neurons. These patterns of induction provide evidence for the differential regulation of members of this family of genes in a physiological context.
N-glycosylation is a highly conserved glycan modification, and more than 7000 proteins are N-glycosylated in humans. N-glycosylation has many biological functions such as protein folding, trafficking, and signal transduction. Thus, glycan modification to proteins is profoundly involved in numerous physiological and pathological processes. The N-glycan precursor is biosynthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) from dolichol phosphate by sequential enzymatic reactions to generate the dolichol-linked oligosaccharide composed of 14 sugar residues, Glc3Man9GlcNAc2. The oligosaccharide is then en bloc transferred to the consensus sequence N-X-S/T (X represents any amino acid except proline) of nascent proteins. Subsequently, the N-glycosylated nascent proteins enter the folding step, in which N-glycans contribute largely to attaining the correct protein fold by recruiting the lectin-like chaperones, calnexin, and calreticulin. Despite the N-glycan-dependent folding process, some glycoproteins do not fold correctly, and these misfolded glycoproteins are destined to degradation by proteasomes in the cytosol. Properly folded proteins are transported to the Golgi, and N-glycans undergo maturation by the sequential reactions of glycosidases and glycosyltransferases, generating complex-type N-glycans. N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferases (GnT-III, GnT-IV, and GnT-V) produce branched N-glycan structures, affording a higher complexity to N-glycans. In this chapter, we provide an overview of the biosynthetic pathway of N-glycans in the ER and Golgi.
BACKGROUND: Silencing of normal gene expression occurs early in the apoptosis of neurons, well before the cell is committed to the death pathway, and has been extensively characterized in injured retinal ganglion cells. The causative mechanism of this widespread change in gene expression is unknown. We investigated whether an epigenetic change in active chromatin, specifically histone H4 deacetylation, was an underlying mechanism of gene silencing in apoptotic retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) following an acute injury to the optic nerve.RESULTS: Histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) translocates to the nuclei of dying cells shortly after lesion of the optic nerve and is associated with an increase in nuclear HDAC activity and widespread histone deacetylation. H4 in promoters of representative genes was rapidly and indiscriminately deacetylated, regardless of the gene examined. As apoptosis progressed, H4 of silenced genes remained deacetylated, while H4 of newly activated genes regained, or even increased, its acetylated state. Inhibition of retinal HDAC activity with trichostatin A (TSA) was able to both preserve the expression of a representative RGC-specific gene and attenuate cell loss in response to optic nerve damage.CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that histone deacetylation plays a central role in transcriptional dysregulation in dying RGCs. The data also suggests that HDAC3, in particular, may feature heavily in apoptotic gene silencing.
PURPOSE: Nephrolithiasis and renal failure secondary to severe hyperoxaluria were complications of jejunoileal bypass for obesity, leading to the discontinuation of this procedure in the United States in 1980. Bariatric procedures currently in use have not been adequately evaluated for this complication.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We compared 24-hour urine chemistry studies of 132 patients with nephrolithiasis who had undergone bariatric surgery with the urine chemistry studies of patients who had undergone jejunoileal bypass, those with routine kidney stones and normal subjects. The primary aim was to determine if hyperoxaluria developed in patients who underwent bariatric surgery and had kidney stones as had been seen with jejunoileal bypass.RESULTS: Patients who have undergone modern bariatric surgery had an adjusted mean urine oxalate excretion of 83 mg per day compared to 39 mg per day for routine kidney stone formers and 34 mg per day for normal subjects (p <0.001 for both comparisons), but not quite as high as that found in patients treated with jejunoileal bypass (102 mg per day, p <0.001). Urine supersaturation of calcium oxalate, the main driving force for calcium oxalate stone formation, was higher in patients treated with bariatric surgery compared to routine kidney stone formers and normal subjects (p <0.001 for both comparisons).CONCLUSIONS: Hyperoxaluria is the most significant abnormality of urine chemistry studies in patients with kidney stones who have undergone bariatric surgery. Many of these patients have a degree of hyperoxaluria that could lead to kidney failure. Further studies are required to determine the prevalence of this problem in patients who have undergone bariatric surgery.
Super-enhancers (SEs) are clusters of transcriptional enhancers which control the expression of cell identity and disease-associated genes. Current studies demonstrated the role of multiple factors in SE formation; however, a systematic analysis to assess the relative predictive importance of chromatin and sequence features of SEs and their constituents is lacking. In addition, a predictive model that integrates various types of data to predict SEs has not been established. Here, we integrated diverse types of genomic and epigenomic datasets to identify key signatures of SEs and investigated their predictive importance. Through integrative modeling, we found Cdk8, Cdk9, and Smad3 as new features of SEs, which can define known and new SEs in mouse embryonic stem cells and pro-B cells. We compared six state-of-the-art machine learning models to predict SEs and showed that non-parametric ensemble models performed better as compared to parametric. We validated these models using cross-validation and also independent datasets in four human cell-types. Taken together, our systematic analysis and ranking of features can be used as a platform to define and understand the biology of SEs in other cell-types.
The reality of primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular complications in people with diabetes is alarming, even in developed countries with a well-structured medical system. Even though therapeutic targets have been more clearly defined during the last decades, their implementation is still suboptimal. Financial and structural reasons, insufficient information of physicians and patients, along with a low compliance of the latter are only a few reasons that have been incriminated. To eliminate some of these inconveniences, attempts to standardize and simplify therapies have been made. Treatment with aspirin and statin for every patient with diabetes has been postulated. Some went even further, developing the concept of a "polypill," an integrated pharmacological agent with up to six different compounds meant to prevent cardiovascular disease in the broad population. Likewise, the idea of a "polymeal" tries to implement healthy nutrients into the populations' lifestyle in a standardized fashion. Our article highlights some of the advantages and pitfalls of these concepts and reflects our point of view with regard to some treatment aspects in people with diabetes. As part of a pro and contra discussion, our article is arguing against the use of statins in all patients with diabetes and especially against the indiscriminate use of a polypill.
BACKGROUND: Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal, dominantly inherited neurocutaneous syndrome characterized by a wide range of neurological abnormalities, tumors of different organs, and variable clinical symtomatology and severity. TSC is caused by mutations in either of two tumor suppressor genes: TSC1 or TSC2. The aim of this study was to analyze the clinical picture of TSC in patients with an identical TSC2 mutation. We tried to discover to what extent we may expect variability in the clinical set of symptoms in patients with identical mutation of TSC2 gene.MATERIAL/METHODS: Mutations were identified in 100 of 170 cases. There were only 4 patients with the same type of TSC2 mutation: 5238-5255 del 18bp, del 1746 HIKRLR. Their ages were 1.5, 9, 9, and 10 years. A standardized clinical assessment of TSC symptoms was used.RESULTS: Epilepsy, depigmented spots, and periventricular calcification and cortical tubers were diagnosed in all the 4 patients, cardiac rhabdomyoma and angiomyolipoma of the kidneys in 3, and mental retardation and forehead fibroma in 2. Other symptoms occurred rarely or were absent. There was variability in TSC symptoms in patients with the identical type of TSC2 mutation. The main symptoms were present in all or in the majority of patients. Clinical picture also differed with the age of patient.CONCLUSIONS: There are many influencing factors contributing to the diversity of the clinical picture and pathology of TSC. Obviously, a greater number of cases are needed for further analysis and more precise conclusions.
CONTEXT: Patients with amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) and left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction have a high mortality rate. Usually, medical therapy is the first choice for AIT patients, whereas the role of the thyroidectomy is unsettled.OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to evaluate the effect of a total thyroidectomy on cardiac function and survival of AIT patients with severe LV systolic dysfunction.DESIGN: This was a retrospective cohort study.SETTINGS: The study was conducted at a tertiary university center.PATIENTS: All AIT patients (n=24; nine patients with type 1 AIT, 15 patients with type 2 AIT) referred to the Department of Endocrinology and submitted to a total thyroidectomy at the Department of Surgery, both at the University of Pisa, during the years 1997-2010.INTERVENTION: The intervention was a total thyroidectomy.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: LV ejection fraction (EF) after the thyroidectomy and survival in December 2011 were measured.RESULTS: All enrolled patients had previously undergone to medical treatment for AIT, as appropriate, without achieving euthyroidism. Patients with moderate to severe LV systolic dysfunction (EF<40%, group 1, n=9) or with mild systolic dysfunction (40%≤EF≤50%, group 2, n=5) were compared with patients with normal systolic function (EF>50%, group 3, n=10). Two months after thyroidectomy, under levothyroxine replacement therapy, LVEF improved in patients with LV systolic dysfunction, particularly in those of group 1, in whom it increased from 28.2±7.2 to 38.3±6% (P=0.007). On the contrary, LVEF did not significantly change in group 3 (from 57.1±3.0 to 59.8±6.6%, P=0.242). The mean follow-up was 67±42 months. No death occurred during and 2 months after surgery. One death occurred in one patient of group 1, 30 months after the thyroidectomy, due to acute myocardial infarction. No patient had relevant complications of thyroidectomy.CONCLUSIONS: Total thyroidectomy, by rapidly restoring euthyroidism, may improve cardiac function and reduce the risk of mortality in AIT patients with severe LV dysfunction.
The association between aortic valve stenosis and gastrointestinal bleeding, traditionally known as Heyde's syndrome, is the result of a quantitative loss of the highest molecular weight von Willebrand multimers (type 2A von Willebrand syndrome). This results in bleeding from areas of high shear stress such as gastrointestinal angiodysplasias. Correction of this bleeding diathesis after surgical aortic valve replacement has been well described. The effect of transcutaneous aortic valve implantation on Heyde's syndrome has yet to be studied. Herein, we report a patient with severe aortic stenosis, type 2A von Willebrand syndrome, and hemorrhagic shock from gastrointestinal bleeding who underwent successful transcutaneous aortic valve implantation.
OBJECTIVE: To characterize the pharmacokinetics of the oral, non-estrogen agent ospemifene, an estrogen agonist/antagonist with tissue-selective effects (also called a selective estrogen receptor modulator) that was recently approved for the treatment of dyspareunia associated with vulvar and vaginal atrophy in postmenopausal women.METHODS: Two open-label, Phase 1 studies were conducted to determine the pharmacokinetics of ospemifene in healthy postmenopausal women. In the single-dose study, 60 mg of [3H]-ospemifene was orally administered to 6 subjects. Blood, urine, and fecal samples were collected predose and serially up to 240 hours postdose. In the multiple-dose study, 12 subjects received 60 mg of ospemifene once daily for 9 days. Blood samples were collected predose and serially postdose on Day 1, predose on Days 7 and 8, and predose and serially postdose on Day 9.RESULTS: Ospemifene exhibited high plasma protein binding and was extensively metabolized, predominantly to 4-hydroxyospemifene and 4'-hydroxyospemifene. In the single-dose study, ospemifene was rapidly absorbed, with a median tmax of 1.50 hours and geometric mean Cmax of 612 ng/ml. The geometric mean (CV%) t1/2 was 24.5 (21.3) hours and 29.0 (18.0) hours for ospemifene and 4-hydroxyospemifene, respectively. Fecal elimination accounted for 75% of the administered [3H]-ospemifene dose in 240 hours. In the multiple dosing study, steady state was reached by Day 7. The mean t1/2 at steady state for ospemifene was 29.1 hours. High values for volume of distribution and total clearance suggested extensive tissue distribution and efficient elimination of ospemifene.CONCLUSIONS: In healthy postmenopausal women, ospemifene 60 mg/day reached steady state concentrations by Day 7 and showed minimal accumulation of parent drug or its two main metabolites, indicating that once daily dosing is appropriate.
BACKGROUND & AIMS: p73 belongs to the p53 family of transcription factors known to regulate cell cycle and apoptosis. The Trp73 gene has two promoters that drive the expression of two major p73 isoform subfamilies: TA and ΔN. In general, TAp73 isoforms show proapoptotic activities, whereas members of the N-terminally truncated (ΔN) p73 subfamily that lack the transactivation domain show antiapoptotic functions. We found that upregulation of ΔNp73 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) correlated with reduced survival. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanisms accounting for the oncogenic role of ΔNp73 in HCC.RESULTS: ΔNp73β can directly interfere with the transcriptional activation function of the TA (containing the transactivation domain) isoforms of the p53 family and consequently inhibit transactivation of proapoptotic target genes. Interference of ΔNp73β with apoptosis-/chemosensitivity takes place at several levels of apoptosis signaling. ΔNp73β negatively regulates the genes encoding for the death receptors CD95, TNF-R1, TRAIL-R2 and TNFRSF18. Furthermore, ΔNp73β represses the genes encoding caspase-2, -3, -6, -8 and -9. Concomitantly, ΔNp73β inhibits apoptosis emanating from mitochondria.CONCLUSIONS: Thus, ΔNp73 expression in HCC selects against both the death receptor and the mitochondrial apoptosis activity of the TA isoforms. Our data suggest that ΔNp73 isoforms repress apoptosis-related genes of the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis signaling pathways thereby contributing to chemoresistance. The clinical importance of these data is evidenced by our finding that the ΔNp73ß target gene signature can predict the prognosis of patients suffering from HCC.
An improved understanding of the molecular mechanisms in synapse formation provides insight into both learning and memory and the etiology of neurodegenerative disorders. Coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1) is a protein methyltransferase that negatively regulates synaptic gene expression and inhibits neuronal differentiation. Despite its regulatory function in neurons, little is known about the CARM1 cellular location and its role in dendritic maturation and synapse formation. Here, we examined the effects of CARM1 inhibition on dendritic spine and synapse morphology in the rat hippocampus. CARM1 was localized in hippocampal post-synapses, with immunocytochemistry and electron microscopy revealing co-localization of CARM1 with post-synaptic density (PSD)-95 protein, a post-synaptic marker. Specific siRNA-mediated suppression of CARM1 expression resulted in precocious dendritic maturation, with increased spine width and density at sites along dendrites and induction of mushroom-type spines. These changes were accompanied by a striking increase in the cluster size and number of key synaptic proteins, including N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor subunit 2B (NR2B) and PSD-95. Similarly, pharmacological inhibition of CARM1 activity with the CARM1-specific inhibitor AMI-1 significantly increased spine width and mushroom-type spines and also increased the cluster size and number of NR2B and cluster size of PSD-95. These results suggest that CARM1 is a post-synaptic protein that plays roles in dendritic maturation and synaptic formation and that spatiotemporal regulation of CARM1 activity modulates neuronal connectivity and improves synaptic dysfunction.
Orexins (also known as hypocretins) play critical roles in the regulation of sleep/wakefulness states by activating two G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), orexin 1 (OX1R) and orexin 2 receptors (OX2R). In order to understand the differential contribution of both receptors in regulating sleep/wakefulness states we compared the pharmacological effects of a newly developed OX2R antagonist (2-SORA), Compound 1 m (C1 m), with those of a dual orexin receptor antagonist (DORA), suvorexant, in C57BL/6J mice. After oral administration in the dark period, both C1m and suvorexant decreased wakefulness time with similar efficacy in a dose-dependent manner. While C1m primarily increased total non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep time without affecting episode durations and with minimal effects on REM sleep, suvorexant increased both total NREM and REM sleep time and episode durations with predominant effects on REM sleep. Fos-immunostaining showed that both compounds affected the activities of arousal-related neurons with different patterns. The number of Fos-IR noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus was lower in the suvorexant group as compared with the control and C1m-treated groups. In contrast, the numbers of Fos-IR neurons in histaminergic neurons in the tuberomamillary nucleus and serotonergic neurons in the dorsal raphe were reduced to a similar extent in the suvorexant and C1m groups as compared with the vehicle-treated group. Together, these results suggest that an orexin-mediated suppression of REM sleep via potential activation of OX1Rs in the locus coeruleus may possibly contribute to the differential effects on sleep/wakefulness exerted by a DORA as compared to a 2-SORA.
Bladder cancer is the most common malignancy involving the genitourinary system (Siegel et al. in CA Cancer J Clin, 66:7-30, 2016). In the USA, it is the fifth most common cancer and approximately 79,000 new cases will be diagnosed in 2017 (Siegel et al. in CA Cancer J Clin, 66:7-30, 2016). The mortality from bladder cancer is approximately 17,000 deaths each year (Siegel et al. in CA Cancer J Clin, 66:7-30, 2016). The incidence rate for bladder cancer is higher in men compared to women. Risk factors are predominantly related to tobacco smoking, although infection with Schistosoma haematobium is another risk factor in selected populations (Antoni et al. in Eur Urol, 71:96-108, 2017). Cisplatin-based systemic chemotherapy regimens remain the standard of care in both the neoadjuvant and metastatic setting for muscle-invasive bladder cancer (Gupta et al. in Cancer, 9(15):1-14, 2017; Von der Maase et al. in J Clin Oncol, 23:4602-4608, 2005; De Santis et al. in J Clin Oncol, 30:191-199, 2012; Bellmunt et al. in J Clin Oncol, 27: 4454-4461, 2009). There is an estimated overall survival of 9-15 months in metastatic bladder cancer in those who receive the standard of care platinum-based chemotherapy (Von der Maase et al. in J Clin Oncol, 23:4602-4608, 2005; De Santis et al. in J Clin Oncol, 30:191-199, 2012). The median survival, however, is significantly reduced after relapse in patient treated with platinum chemotherapy to less than 7 months (Bellmunt et al. in J Clin Oncol, 27: 4454-4461, 2009). Thus, this approach is preferred for patients who can tolerate this treatment as first-line chemotherapy (Gupta et al. in Cancer, 9(15):1-14, 2017). Until recently, there were few treatment options for those patients with poor performance status who are ineligible to receive cisplatin including renal insufficiency and multiple comorbidities or had disease progression after receiving platinum-based chemotherapy (Gupta et al. in Cancer, 9(15):1-14, 2017). With further understanding of tumor immune evasion, systemic immunotherapy which utilizes the patient's own immune system directly to eradicate and target neoplastic cells, has now been approved for urothelial bladder cancer. Monoclonal antibodies that target programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), including Nivolumab and Pembrolizumab, and its ligand, PD-L1, including Atezolizumab, Durvalumab, Avelumab, have all been investigated and approved in the setting of metastatic refractory urothelial cancer (Gupta et al. in Cancer, 9(15):1-14, 2017; Von der Maase et al. in J Clin Oncol, 23:4602-4608, 2005; Zilchi et al. in BioMed Res Int, 2017, 2017, doi: 10.1155/2017/5618174 ). Atezolizumab and Pembrolizumab have also been approved as first-line therapy in the setting of cisplatin-ineligible metastatic bladder cancer (Gupta et al. in Cancer, 9(15):1-14, 2017; Zilchi et al. in BioMed Res Int, 2017, 2017, doi: 10.1155/2017/5618174 ). Those that target cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4, including Ipilimumab and Tremelimumab, have also been investigated and further studies are being performed (Gupta et al. in Cancer, 9(15):1-14, 2017; Zilchi et al. in BioMed Res Int, 2017, 2017, doi: 10.1155/2017/5618174 ). This review outlines the systemic immunotherapies that have been approved or are currently being investigated.
BACKGROUND: Severity of illness is an important consideration in making the decision to transfuse as it is the sicker patient that often needs a red cell transfusion. Red blood cell (RBC) transfusions could potentially have direct effects and interact with presenting illness by contributing to pathologies such as multi-organ dysfunction and acute lung injury thus exerting a considerable impact on overall morbidity and mortality. In this study, we examine if transfusion is an independent predictor of mortality, or if outcomes are merely a result of the initial severity as predicted by Pediatric Risk of Mortality (PRISM) III, Pediatric Index of Mortality (PIM2), and day 1 Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction (PELOD) scores.METHODS: A single center retrospective study was conducted using data from a prospectively maintained transfusion database and center-specific data at our pediatric ICU between January 2009 and December 2012. Multivariate regression was used to control for the effects of clinical findings, therapy, and severity scores, with mortality as the dependent variable. Likelihood ratios and area under the curve were used to test the fidelity of severity scores by comparing transfused vs. non-transfused patients.RESULTS: There were 4975 admissions that met entry criteria. In multivariate analysis, PRISM III scores and serum hemoglobin were significant predictors of transfusion (p < 0.05). Transfused and non-transfused subjects were distinctly disparate, so multivariate regression was used to control for differences. Severity scores, age, volume transfused, and vasoactive agents were significantly associated with mortality whereas hemoglobin was not. A substantial number of transfusions (45 %) occurred in the first 24 h, and patients transfused later (24-48 h) were more likely to die compared to this earlier time point. Likelihood ratio testing revealed statistically significant differences in severity scoring systems to predict mortality in transfused vs. non-transfused patients.CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that RBC transfusion is an important risk factor that is statistically independent of severity. The timing of transfusions that related strongest to mortality remained outside the purview of severity scoring, as these happened beyond the timing of data collection for most scoring systems.
Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is a common human enzymopathy that affects cellular redox status and may lower flux into nonoxidative pathways of glucose metabolism. Oxidative stress may worsen systemic glucose tolerance and cardiometabolic syndrome. We hypothesized that G6PD deficiency exacerbates diet-induced systemic metabolic dysfunction by increasing oxidative stress but in myocardium prevents diet-induced oxidative stress and pathology. WT and G6PD-deficient (G6PDX) mice received a standard high-starch diet, a high-fat/high-sucrose diet to induce obesity (DIO), or a high-fructose diet. After 31 wk, DIO increased adipose and body mass compared with the high-starch diet but to a greater extent in G6PDX than WT mice (24 and 20% lower, respectively). Serum free fatty acids were increased by 77% and triglycerides by 90% in G6PDX mice, but not in WT mice, by DIO and high-fructose intake. G6PD deficiency did not affect glucose tolerance or the increased insulin levels seen in WT mice. There was no diet-induced hypertension or cardiac dysfunction in either mouse strain. However, G6PD deficiency increased aconitase activity by 42% and blunted markers of nonoxidative glucose pathway activation in myocardium, including the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway activation and advanced glycation end product formation. These results reveal a complex interplay between diet-induced metabolic effects and G6PD deficiency, where G6PD deficiency decreases weight gain and hyperinsulinemia with DIO, but elevates serum free fatty acids, without affecting glucose tolerance. On the other hand, it modestly suppressed indexes of glucose flux into nonoxidative pathways in myocardium, suggesting potential protective effects.
STUDY OBJECTIVES: Suvorexant, an orexin receptor antagonist, improves sleep in healthy subjects (HS) and patients with insomnia. We compared the electroencephalographic (EEG) power spectral density (PSD) profile of suvorexant with placebo using data from a phase 2 trial in patients with insomnia. We also compared suvorexant's PSD profile with the profiles of other insomnia treatments using data from 3 HS studies.DESIGN: Phase 2 trial--randomized, double-blind, two-period (4 w per period) crossover. HS studies--randomized, double-blind, crossover.SETTING: Sleep laboratories.PARTICIPANTS: Insomnia patients (n = 229) or HS (n = 124).INTERVENTIONS: Phase 2 trial--suvorexant 10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg, 80 mg, placebo; HS study 1--suvorexant 10 mg, 50 mg, placebo; HS study 2--gaboxadol 15 mg, zolpidem 10 mg, placebo; HS study 3--trazodone 150 mg, placebo.MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: The PSD of the EEG signal at 1-32 Hz of each PSG recording during nonrapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep were calculated. The day 1 and day 28 PSD profiles of suvorexant at all four doses during NREM and REM sleep in patients with insomnia were generally flat and close to 1.0 (placebo) at all frequencies. The day 1 PSD profile of suvorexant in HS was similar to that in insomnia patients. In contrast, the other three drugs had distinct PSD profiles in HS that differed from each other.CONCLUSIONS: Suvorexant at clinically effective doses had limited effects on power spectral density compared with placebo in healthy subjects and in patients with insomnia, in contrast to the three comparison insomnia treatments. These findings suggest the possibility that antagonism of the orexin pathway might lead to improvements in sleep without major changes in the patient's neurophysiology as assessed by electroencephalographic.
We previously demonstrated that stimulation of human T-lymphocytes with calcium ionophores induced the phosphorylation and enzymatic activation of ERK2. We now report on the mechanism by which calcium-ionophore-induced activation of ERK1 and 2 occurs in these cells. The activation of ERK1 and 2 by increases in intracellular calcium was inhibited by calmidazolium suggesting the involvement of calmodulin in this response. To further elucidate the mechanism by which calcium-induced ERK activation occurs, we used the CaM-kinase inhibitor KN-93 and an inactive analog of KN-93 (KN-92). KN-93, but not KN-92, blocked ionomycin-induced activation of ERK1 and 2 in human T lymphocytes. We previously demonstrated that stimulation of T lymphocytes with ionomycin or A23187 resulted in a CaM-kinase-dependent shift in the mobility of p56(Lck). To determine if p56(Lck) was involved in calcium-induced ERK activation, we stimulated the p56(Lck) negative Jurkat cell derivatives, J.CaM1.6 and J.CaM1/Rep3, with ionomycin. In these p56(Lck) negative cell lines, activation of ERK1 and 2 in response to ionomycin was only minimally detected. When J.CaM1 cells were reconstituted with p56(Lck), ionomycin induced ERK1 and 2 activation. Treatment of Jurkat cells with PP2, an inhibitor of p56(Lck), inhibited calcium-induced, but not PMA-induced, ERK1 and 2 activation. Treatment of Jurkat cells with the MEK inhibitor PD98059 blocked ionomycin-induced ERK activation, but not the shift in the mobility of p56(Lck). Our data suggests that increases in intracellular calcium induce the activation of ERK1 and 2 in human T lymphocytes via sequential activation of CaM-kinase and phosphorylation of p56(Lck).
OBJECTIVE: Although standard treatment for advanced epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) consists of surgical debulking and intravenous platinum- and taxane-based chemotherapy, favorable oncological outcomes have been recently reported with the use of cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC). The aim of the study was to analyze feasibility and results of CRS and HIPEC in patients with advanced EOC.MATERIALS/METHODS: This is an open, prospective phase 2 study including patients with primary or recurrent peritoneal carcinomatosis due to EOC. Thirty-nine patients with a mean (SD) age of 57.3 (9.7) years (range, 34-74 years) were included between September 2005 and December 2009. Thirty patients (77%) had recurrent EOC and 9 (23%) had primary EOC.RESULTS: For HIPEC, cisplatin and paclitaxel were used for 11 patients (28%), cisplatin and doxorubicin for 26 patients (66%), paclitaxel and doxorubicin for 1 patient (3%), and doxorubicin alone for 1 patient (3%). The median intra-abdominal outflow temperature was 41.5°C. The mean peritoneal cancer index (PCI) was 11.1 (range, 1-28); and according to the intraoperative tumor extent, the tumor volume was classified as low (PCI <15) or high (PCI ≥15) in 27 patients (69%) and 12 patients (31%), respectively. Microscopically complete cytoreduction was achieved for 35 patients (90%), macroscopic cytoreduction was achieved for 3 patients (7%), and a gross tumor debulking was performed for 1 patient (3%). Mean hospital stay was 23.8 days. Postoperative complications occurred in 7 patients (18%), and reoperations in 3 patients (8%). There was one postoperative death. Recurrence was seen in 23 patients (59%) with a mean recurrence time of 14.4 months (range, 1-49 months).CONCLUSIONS: Hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy after extensive CRS for advanced EOC is feasible with acceptable morbidity and mortality. Complete cytoreduction may improve survival in highly selected patients. Additional follow-up and further studies are needed to determine the effects of HIPEC on survival.
Dravet syndrome is a severe form of epileptic encephalopathy characterized by early onset epileptic seizures followed by ataxia and cognitive decline. Approximately 80% of patients with Dravet syndrome have been associated with heterozygous mutations in SCN1A gene encoding voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) α(I) subunit, whereas a homozygous mutation (p.Arg125Cys) of SCN1B gene encoding VGSC β(I) subunit was recently described in a patient with Dravet syndrome. To further examine the involvement of homozygous SCN1B mutations in the etiology of Dravet syndrome, we performed mutational analyses on SCN1B in 286 patients with epileptic disorders, including 67 patients with Dravet syndrome who have been negative for SCN1A and SCN2A mutations. In the cohort, we found one additional homozygous mutation (p.Ile106Phe) in a patient with Dravet syndrome. The identified homozygous SCN1B mutations indicate that SCN1B is an etiologic candidate underlying Dravet syndrome.
Rap1-interacting factor 1 (Rif1) was originally identified in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a telomere-binding protein that negatively regulates telomerase-mediated telomere elongation. Although this function is conserved in the distantly related fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, recent studies, both in yeasts and in metazoans, reveal that Rif1 also functions more globally, both in the temporal control of DNA replication and in DNA repair. Rif1 proteins are large and characterized by N-terminal HEAT repeats, predicted to form an elongated alpha-helical structure. In addition, all Rif1 homologs contain two short motifs, abbreviated RVxF/SILK, that are implicated in recruitment of the PP1 (yeast Glc7) phosphatase. In yeasts the RVxF/SILK domains have been shown to play a role in control of DNA replication initiation, at least in part through targeted de-phosphorylation of proteins in the pre-Replication Complex. In human cells Rif1 is recruited to DNA double-strand breaks through an interaction with 53BP1 where it counteracts DNA resection, thus promoting repair by non-homologous end-joining. This function requires the N-terminal HEAT repeat-containing domain. Interestingly, this domain is also implicated in DNA end protection at un-capped telomeres in yeast. We conclude by discussing the deployment of Rif1 at telomeres in yeasts from both an evolutionary perspective and in light of its recently discovered global functions.
Cardioembolism accounts for approximately 20% of ischaemic strokes, and is associated with high mortality and propensity to recurrences. Approximately, 30% of ischaemic strokes remain cryptogenic despite improved imaging modalities and technological improvements to identify their cause. Of the long list of various cardiac conditions associated with an increased risk of cardioembolic strokes, non-valvular atrial fibrillation is the most common cause. Unsurprisingly, the stroke risk associated with these conditions is highly variable and non-homogenous, with many risk factors additive to the overall risk profile. Treatment with vitamin K-antagonists substantially reduces the long-term complications associated with cardioembolism in some high-risk patients, for example, in atrial fibrillation. Careful selection of antithrombotic drug regime needs to be carried out in patients individually to minimise the risk of bleeding encountered with such therapy. Apart from atrial fibrillation, there is relatively limited evidence for the role of antithrombotic therapy for other cardiac conditions associated with cardioembolism and how long one should treat.
STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective case report.OBJECTIVE: The objective of this article is to report an unusual complication of dry needling.SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Epidural hematomas after dry needling are quite unusual and only a few cases of epidural hematoma after acupuncture have been reported in the literature. We are presenting the first report of acute cervical epidural hematoma after dry needling.METHODS: A 58-year-old woman presented with quadriparesis and neck pain. Magnetic resonance imaging of the spine revealed a hyperintense mass in the T2-weighted magnetic resonance image at the C2-T2 level, which proved to be an epidural hematoma.RESULTS: Symptoms related to the epidural hematoma resolved after decompression.CONCLUSION: Though rare, epidural hematomas are a possible complication when applying needling therapies. Therapists need to have precise knowledge of human anatomy, especially in the region where he or she will puncture. Continuous attention must be paid throughout the whole procedure.
Biogenesis of mitochondria involves the expression of genes located on nuclear chromosomes as well as on mitochondrial DNA. We studied the coordination of the two genomes by measuring transcript levels for nuclear (IV, Va, and VIc) and mitochondrial (II and III) subunits of cytochrome-c oxidase after altering the mitochondrial content of rat muscle and liver by altering the thyroid state of the animals. Tissue levels of these mRNAs were generally decreased in hypothyroid animals and were up-regulated again after thyroid hormone (T3) treatment. However, significant increases in the levels of all nuclear transcripts were observed in the liver 24 h after T3 treatment, but were delayed or remained unaltered (VIc) in muscle. In contrast, levels of mitochondrial transcripts were elevated early in muscle and late in liver. The abundance of the corresponding polypeptides, which were analyzed by immunoblotting, changed in direction and magnitude according to the changes in their mRNAs, indicating pretranslational control. We conclude that the two genomes are regulated by T3 not through a common coordinating mechanism, but via two separate pathways, which respond to T3 with tissue-specific kinetics. S1-nuclease protection analysis showed that probably only one transcript for subunit VIc is present in both tissues, thus excluding the possibility that the tissue-specific response is due to the expression of two isogenes. The abundance of mitochondrial DNA was unaltered despite the observed changes in mitochondrial transcripts, indicating that mitochondrial gene expression is regulated by transcriptional mechanisms and not by gene dosage as has been postulated by others.
We report the results of studies on the characterization of the mutation associated with marked unbalanced expression of the mutant X chromosome in a karyotypically normal girl with Hunter disease (mucopolysaccharidosis type II). Southern analysis of DNA extracted from somatic cell hybrids containing only the mutant X chromosome showed deletion of the Xq27.3-q28 loci: DXS297 (VK23AC), DXS293 (VK16), FRAXA (pfxa3), DXS296 (VK21A), and the 3' end of the iduronatesulfatase (IDS) gene. The flanking loci--DXS52 (St14-1), DXS304 (U6.2), and DXS369 (RN1)--were intact. On the basis of these results, we concluded that the mutation was a simple deletion extending a maximum of 3-5 cM to the centromeric side of the IDS gene. Both Southern analysis of DNA from somatic cell hybrids, using short segments of IDS cDNA, and PCR of reverse-transcribed RNA from cultured skin fibroblasts indicated that the telomeric terminus of the deletion was localized to a region near the middle of the coding sequences of the gene.
S100 protein is a sensitive marker for melanomas and peripheral nerve sheath tumors. It is, however, expressed by other mesenchymal and epithelial tumors. Despite its low specificity, S100 protein is valuable for the diagnosis of desmoplastic melanomas and peripheral nerve sheath tumors, for which no specific marker is available. Sox10 is a neural crest transcription factor crucial for specification, maturation, and maintenance of Schwann cells and melanocytes. Anti-Sox10 antibody was applied to a variety of neural crest-derived tumors, mesenchymal and epithelial neoplasms, and normal tissues. Sox10 nuclear expression was found in 76 of 78 melanomas (97%) and 38 of 77 malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (49%) whereas S100 protein was expressed in 71 melanomas (91%) and 23 malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (30%). Sox10 was diffusely expressed in schwannomas and neurofibromas. Sox10 reaction was seen only in sustentacular cells of pheochromocytomas/paragangliomas, and occasionally carcinoid tumors from various organs, but it was not seen in the tumor cells. In normal tissues, Sox10 was expressed in Schwann cells, melanocytes, and myoepithelial cells of salivary, bronchial, and mammary glands. Sox10 reaction was not identified in any other mesenchymal and epithelial tumors except for myoepitheliomas and diffuse astrocytomas. Sox10 was expressed by metastatic melanomas and nodal capsular nevus in sentinel lymph nodes, but not by other lymph node components such as dendritic cells. Our results indicate that Sox10 will serve as a more sensitive and specific marker for the diagnosis of melanocytic and schwannian tumors than S100 protein.
Cytokines are believed to be crucial mediators of chronic intestinal inflammation in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) such as Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Many of these cytokines trigger cellular effects and functions through signaling via janus kinase (JAK) and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) molecules. In this way, JAK/STAT signaling controls important events like cell differentiation, secretion of cytokines or proliferation and apoptosis in IBD in both adaptive and innate immune cells. Moreover, JAK/STAT signaling, especially via the IL-6/STAT3 axis, is believed to be involved in the transition of inflammatory lesions to tumors leading to colitis-associated cancer (CAC). In this review, we will introduce the main cellular players and cytokines that contribute to pathogenesis of IBD by JAK/STAT signaling, and will highlight the integrative function that JAK/STATs exert in this context as well as their divergent role in different cells and processes. Moreover, we will explain current concepts of the implication of JAK/STAT signaling in CAC and finally discuss present and future therapies for IBD that interfere with JAK/STAT signaling.
Tay Sachs disease (TSD) is a neurodegenerative disorder due to β-hexosaminidase A deficiency caused by mutations in the HEXA gene. The mutations leading to Tay Sachs disease in India are yet unknown. We aimed to determine mutations leading to TSD in India by complete sequencing of the HEXA gene. The clinical inclusion criteria included neuroregression, seizures, exaggerated startle reflex, macrocephaly, cherry red spot on fundus examination and spasticity. Neuroimaging criteria included thalamic hyperdensities on CT scan/T1W images of MRI of the brain. Biochemical criteria included deficiency of hexosaminidase A (less than 2% of total hexosaminidase activity for infantile patients). Total leukocyte hexosaminidase activity was assayed by 4-methylumbelliferyl-N-acetyl-β-D-glucosamine lysis and hexosaminidase A activity was assayed by heat inactivation method and 4-methylumbelliferyl-N-acetyl-β-D-glucosamine-6-sulphate lysis method. The exons and exon-intron boundaries of the HEXA gene were bidirectionally sequenced using an automated sequencer. Mutations were confirmed in parents and looked up in public databases. In silico analysis for mutations was carried out using SIFT, Polyphen2, MutationT@ster and Accelrys Discovery Studio softwares. Fifteen families were included in the study. We identified six novel missense mutations, c.340 G>A (p.E114K), c.964 G>A (p.D322N), c.964 G>T (p.D322Y), c.1178C>G (p.R393P) and c.1385A>T (p.E462V), c.1432 G>A (p.G478R) and two previously reported mutations. c.1277_1278insTATC and c.508C>T (p.R170W). The mutation p.E462V was found in six unrelated families from Gujarat indicating a founder effect. A previously known splice site mutation c.805+1 G>C and another intronic mutation c.672+30 T>G of unknown significance were also identified. Mutations could not be identified in one family. We conclude that TSD patients from Gujarat should be screened for the common mutation p.E462V.
Juvenile neuronal ceroid-lipofuscinosis (JNCL) or Batten/Spielmeyer-Vogt-Sjogren disease (OMIM #204200) is one of a group of nine clinically related inherited neurodegenerative disorders (CLN1-9). JNCL results from mutations in CLN3 on chromosome 16p12.1. The neuronal loss in Batten disease has been shown to be due to a combination of apoptosis and autophagy suggesting that CLN3P, the defective protein, may have an anti-neuronal death function. PANDER (PANcreatic-DERived factor) is a novel cytokine that was recently cloned from pancreatic islet cells. PANDER is specifically expressed in the pancreatic islets, small intestine, testis, prostate, and neurons of the central nervous system, and has been demonstrated to induce apoptosis. In this study, we over-expressed CLN3P in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells and monitored the effects on PANDER-induced apoptosis. CLN3P significantly increased the survival rate of the SH-SY5Y cells in this system. This study provides additional evidence that the function of CLN3P is related to preventing neuronal apoptosis.
Chimpanzee and gorilla chromosomes differ from human chromosomes by the presence of large blocks of subterminal heterochromatin thought to be composed primarily of arrays of tandem satellite sequence. We explore their sequence composition and organization and show a complex organization composed of specific sets of segmental duplications that have hyperexpanded in concert with the formation of subterminal satellites. These regions are highly copy number polymorphic between and within species, and copy number differences involving hundreds of copies can be accurately estimated by assaying read-depth of next-generation sequencing data sets. Phylogenetic and comparative genomic analyses suggest that the structures have arisen largely independently in the two lineages with the exception of a few seed sequences present in the common ancestor of humans and African apes. We propose a model where an ancestral human-chimpanzee pericentric inversion and the ancestral chromosome 2 fusion both predisposed and protected the chimpanzee and human genomes, respectively, to the formation of subtelomeric heterochromatin. Our findings highlight the complex interplay between duplicated sequences and chromosomal rearrangements that rapidly alter the cytogenetic landscape in a short period of evolutionary time.
Mutations in the gene for fibrillin-1 (FBN1) have been shown to cause Marfan syndrome, an autosomal dominant disorder of connective tissue characterised by pleiotropic manifestations involving primarily the ocular, skeletal, and cardiovascular systems. Fibrillin-1 is a major component of the 10-12 nm microfibrils, which are thought to play a role in tropoelastin deposition and elastic fibre formation in addition to possessing an anchoring function in some tissues. Fibrillin-1 mutations have also been found in patients who do not fulfil clinical criteria for the diagnosis of Marfan syndrome, but have related disorders of connective tissue, such as isolated ectopia lentis, familial aortic aneurysm, and Marfan-like skeletal abnormalities, so that Marfan syndrome may be regarded as one of a range of type 1 fibrillinopathies. There appear to be no particular hot spots since mutations are found throughout the entire fibrillin-1 gene. However, a clustering of mutations associated with the most severe form of Marfan syndrome, neonatal Marfan syndrome, has been noted in a region encompassing exons 24 to 32. The gene for fibrillin-2 (FBN2) is highly homologous to FBN1, and mutations in FBN2 have been shown to cause a phenotypically related disorder termed congenital contractural arachnodactyly. Since mutations in the fibrillin genes are likely to affect the global function of the microfibrils, the term microfibrillopathy may be the most appropriate to designate the spectrum of disease associated with dysfunction of these molecules. The understanding of the global and the molecular functions of the fibrillin containing microfibrils is still incomplete and, correspondingly, no comprehensive theory of the pathogenesis of Marfan syndrome has emerged to date. Many, but not all, fibrillin-1 gene mutations are expected to exert a dominant negative effect, whereby mutant fibrillin monomers impair the global function of the microfibrils. In this paper we review the molecular physiology and pathophysiology of Marfan syndrome and related microfibrillopathies.
SMA is an inherited disease that leads to loss of motor function and ambulation and a reduced life expectancy. We have been working to develop orally administrated, systemically distributed small molecules to increase levels of functional SMN protein. Compound 2 was the first SMN2 splicing modifier tested in clinical trials in healthy volunteers and SMA patients. It was safe and well tolerated and increased SMN protein levels up to 2-fold in patients. Nevertheless, its development was stopped as a precautionary measure because retinal toxicity was observed in cynomolgus monkeys after chronic daily oral dosing (39 weeks) at exposures in excess of those investigated in patients. Herein, we describe the discovery of 1 (risdiplam, RG7916, RO7034067) that focused on thorough pharmacology, DMPK and safety characterization and optimization. This compound is undergoing pivotal clinical trials and is a promising medicine for the treatment of patients in all ages and stages with SMA.
Until recently, suicidality in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) was rarely discussed. A cluster of recent articles, including an article by Culpin et al.1 in this issue, has highlighted not only that suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts can occur in adolescents and young adults with ASD, but also that suicidality is likely more common in ASD than in the general population. Retrospectively, the lack of focus on suicidality in ASD seems surprising when self-injurious behavior has long been a focus of attention in ASD.2 The emerging studies indicate that the increased risk of self-injurious behavior in younger and less cognitively able children with ASD3,4 is matched by an increased risk of suicidality in those at a more advanced developmental level.
Fabry disease: polymorphic haplotypes and a novel missense mutation in the GLA gene. Fabry disease (FD) is an X-linked lysosomal storage disorder with a heterogeneous spectrum of clinical manifestations that are caused by the deficiency of α-galactosidase A (α-Gal-A) activity. Although useful for diagnosis in males, enzyme activity is not a reliable biochemical marker in heterozygous females due to random X-chromosome inactivation, thus rendering DNA sequencing of the α-Gal-A gene, alpha-galactosidase gene (GLA), the most reliable test for the confirmation of diagnosis in females. The spectrum of GLA mutations is highly heterogeneous. Many polymorphic GLA variants have been described, but it is unclear if haplotypes formed by combinations of such variants correlate with FD, thus complicating molecular diagnosis in females with normal α-Gal-A activity. We tested 67 female probands with clinical manifestations that may be associated with FD and 110 control males with normal α-Gal-A activity. Five different combinations of GLA polymorphic variants were identified in 14 of the 67 females, whereas clearcut pathogenetic alterations, p.Met51Ile and p.Met290Leu, were identified in two cases. The latter has not been reported so far, and both mutant forms were found to be responsive to the pharmacological chaperone deoxygalactonojirimycin (DGJ; migalastat hydrochloride). Analysis of the male control population, as well as male relatives of a suspected FD female proband, permitted the identification of seven different GLA gene haplotypes in strong linkage disequilibrium. The identification of haplotypes in control males provides evidence against their involvement in the development of FD phenotypic manifestations.
Maintenance of stem-cell identity requires proper regulation of enhancer activity. Both transcription factors OCT4/SOX2/NANOG and histone methyltransferase complexes MLL/SET1 were shown to regulate enhancer activity, but how they are regulated in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) remains further studies. Here, we report a transcription factor BACH1, which directly interacts with OCT4/SOX2/NANOG (OSN) and MLL/SET1 methyltransferase complexes and maintains pluripotency in mouse ESCs (mESCs). BTB domain and bZIP domain of BACH1 are required for these interactions and pluripotency maintenance. Loss of BACH1 reduced the interaction between NANOG and MLL1/SET1 complexes, and decreased their occupancy on chromatin, and further decreased H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) level on gene promoters and (super-) enhancers, leading to decreased enhancer activity and transcription activity, especially on stemness-related genes. Moreover, BACH1 recruited NANOG through chromatin looping and regulated remote NANOG binding, fine-tuning enhancer-promoter activity and gene expression. Collectively, these observations suggest that BACH1 maintains pluripotency in ESCs by recruiting NANOG and MLL/SET1 complexes to chromatin and maintaining the trimethylated state of H3K4 and enhancer-promoter activity, especially on stemness-related genes.
A comprehensive analysis of two Alu Y lineage subfamilies was undertaken to assess Alu-associated genomic diversity and identify new Alu insertion polymorphisms for the study of human population genetics. Recently integrated Alu elements (283) from the Yg6 and Yi6 subfamilies were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and 25 of the loci analyzed were polymorphic for insertion presence/absence within the genomes of a diverse array of human populations. These newly identified Alu insertion polymorphisms will be useful tools for the study of human genomic diversity. Our screening of the Alu insertion loci also resulted in the recovery of several "young" Alu elements that resided at orthologous positions in nonhuman primate genomes. Sequence analysis demonstrated these "young" Alu insertions were the products of gene conversion events of older, preexisting Alu elements or independent parallel forward insertions of older Alu elements in the same short genomic region. The level of gene conversion between Alu elements suggests that it may have an influence on the single nucleotide polymorphism within Alu elements in the genome. We have also identified two genomic deletions associated with the retroposition and insertion of Alu Y lineage elements into the human genome. This type of Alu retroposition-mediated genomic deletion is a novel source of lineage-specific evolution within primate genomes.
Choroid plexus neoplasms are rare epithelial tumors of the central nervous system. A carcinoma of the choroid plexus occurred in a child from a family with the breast cancer-sarcoma syndrome (Li-Fraumeni or SBLA syndrome), an inherited condition characterized by the development of diverse neoplasms (sarcoma, breast cancer, brain tumors, leukemia, adrenal cortical carcinoma, and others). Choroid plexus carcinomas were identified in two kindreds previously reported with the syndrome. The literature contains reports of choroid plexus neoplasms occurring in families and in individuals with multiple primary tumors. Choroid plexus neoplasm may be a manifestation of the inherited proclivity to tumor development in the breast cancer-sarcoma syndrome.
BACKGROUND: The rs2736100 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is located in the intron 2 of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) gene. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have consistently supported the strong association between this SNP and risk for multiple cancers. Given the important role of the hTERT gene and this SNP in cancer biology, we hypothesize that rs2736100 may also confer susceptibility to anti-cancer drug sensitivity. In this study we aim to investigate the correlation between the rs2736100 genotype and the responsiveness to anti-cancer agents in the NCI-60 cancer cell panel.METHODS AND MATERIALS: The hTERT rs2736100 was genotyped in the NCI-60 cancer cell lines. The relative telomere length (RTL) of each cell line was quantified using real-time PCR. The genotype was then correlated with publically available drug sensitivity data of two agents with telomerase-inhibition activity: Geldanamycin (HSP90 inhibitor) and RHPS4/BRACO19 (G-quadruplex stabilizer) as well as additional 110 commonly used agents with established mechanism of action. The association between rs2736100 and mutation status of TP53 gene was also tested.RESULTS: The C allele of the SNP was significantly correlated with increased sensitivity to RHPS4/BRACO19 with an additive effect (r = -0.35, p = 0.009) but not with Geldanamycin. The same allele was also significantly associated with sensitivity to antimitotic agents compared to other agents (p = 0.003). The highest correlation was observed between the SNP and paclitaxel (r = -0.36, p = 0.005). The telomere length was neither associated with rs2736100 nor with sensitivity to anti-cancer agents. The C allele of rs2736100 was significantly associated with increased mutation rate in TP53 gene (p = 0.004).CONCLUSION: Our data suggested that the cancer risk allele of hTERT rs2736100 polymorphism may also affect the cancer cell response to both TERT inhibitor and anti-mitotic agents, which might be attributed to the elevated telomerase-independent activity of hTERT, as well as the increased risk for TP53 gene mutagenesis conferred by the polymorphism. Detailed mechanisms need to be further investigated.
Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS, OMIM 176670) is a rare multisystem childhood premature aging disorder linked to mutations in the LMNA gene. The most common HGPS mutation is found at position G608G within exon 11 of the LMNA gene. This mutation results in the deletion of 50 amino acids at the carboxyl-terminal tail of prelamin A, and the truncated protein is called progerin. Progerin only undergoes a subset of the normal post-translational modifications and remains permanently farnesylated. Several attempts to rescue the normal cellular phenotype with farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTIs) and other compounds have resulted in partial cellular recovery. Using proteomics, we report here that progerin induces changes in the composition of the HGPS nuclear proteome, including alterations to several components of the protein degradation pathways. Consequently, proteasome activity and autophagy are impaired in HGPS cells. To restore protein clearance in HGPS cells, we treated HGPS cultures with sulforaphane (SFN), an antioxidant derived from cruciferous vegetables. We determined that SFN stimulates proteasome activity and autophagy in normal and HGPS fibroblast cultures. Specifically, SFN enhances progerin clearance by autophagy and reverses the phenotypic changes that are the hallmarks of HGPS. Therefore, SFN is a promising therapeutic avenue for children with HGPS.
The role of epigenetic regulation is in large parts connected to cancer, but additionally, its therapeutic claim in neurological disorders has emerged. Inhibition of histone H3 lysine N-methyltransferase, especially G9a, has been recently shown to restore candidate genes from silenced parental chromosomes in the imprinting disorder Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). In addition to this epigenetic approach, pitolisant as G-protein coupled histamine H3 receptor (H3R) antagonist has demonstrated promising therapeutic effects for Prader-Willi syndrome. To combine these pioneering principles of drug action, we aimed to identify compounds that combine both activities, guided by the pharmacophore blueprint for both targets. However, pitolisant as selective H3R inverse agonist with FDA and EMA-approval did not show the required inhibition at G9a. Pharmacological characterization of the prominent G9a inhibitor A-366, that is as well an inhibitor of the epigenetic reader protein Spindlin1, revealed its high affinity at H3R while showing subtype selectivity among subsets of the histaminergic and dopaminergic receptor families. This work moves prominent G9a ligands forward as pharmacological tools to prove for a potentially combined, symptomatic and causal, therapy in PWS by bridging the gap between drug development for G-protein coupled receptors and G9a as an epigenetic effector in a multi-targeting approach.
A mutant of Bacillus subtilis defective in the constitutive activity of O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase was isolated from a strain (ada-1) deficient in the adaptive response to DNA alkylation. Cells carrying the mutation dat-1 which was responsible for the defect in constitutive activity exhibited hypersensitivity for lethality and mutagenesis when challenged with methyl-nitroso compounds. The constitutive activity is independent of the adaptive response, and seems to function as a basal defense against environmental alkylating agents.
PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The nitric oxide (NO)-soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC)-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) pathway plays an important role in the regulation of cardiovascular function, and it is disrupted in heart failure (HF), resulting in decreased protection against myocardial injury. Impaired NO-sGC-cGMP signaling in HF is secondary to reduced NO bioavailability and altered redox state of sGC, which becomes less responsive to NO. The sGC activator cinaciguat increases cGMP levels by direct NO-independent activation of sGC and may be particularly effective in conditions of increased oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction, and therefore reduced NO levels, at the expense of a greater risk of hypotension. Conversely, sGC stimulators (riociguat and vericiguat) enhance sGC sensitivity to endogenous NO, thus exerting a more physiological action.RECENT FINDINGS: Clinical trials have suggested the benefit of vericiguat in patients with high-risk HF; in particular, a lower incidence of death from cardiovascular causes or HF hospitalization. Adding vericiguat may be considered in individual patients with HF, and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (HFrEF) particularly those at higher risk of HF hospitalization.
OBJECTIVE: The combination of clinical remission and mucosal healing represents a major goal of different treatment strategies for ulcerative colitis (UC). This study aimed to assess which of the endoscopic indices used to evaluate mucosal changes in UC are correlated with clinical indices currently used to determine disease activity, as well as which of the endoscopic indices are correlated with the Geboes Index used for histological evaluation. It also aimed to find correlations between the currently used clinical activity indices and the histological Geboes Index.METHODS: A group of 49 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of UC and a group of 52 individuals without a diagnosis of gastrointestinal disease, who constituted the control group, were investigated. All patients were evaluated by colonoscopy, and the severity of mucosal changes was scored in terms of nine different endoscopic indices commonly used in both pharmacological trials and clinical practice. Evaluation was also carried out using clinical and histological indices. Endoscopic indices used for UC were then correlated with different clinical and histological indices to find the strongest correlations.RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: A high correlation was demonstrated between three of the 11 evaluated clinical indices - Improvement Based on Individual Symptom Scores, Ulcerative Colitis Disease Activity Index, and Schroeder Index - and all nine endoscopic indices - Ulcerative Colitis Endoscopic Index of Severity, Baron Score, Schroeder Index, Feagan Index, Powell-Tuck Index, Rachmilewitz Index, Sutherland Index, Lofberg Index, and Lemman Index. Improvement Based on Individual Symptom Scores was the index with the highest correlation with all the endoscopic indices used for UC. The above indices are recommended for clinical evaluation of UC activity. The Ulcerative Colitis Endoscopic Index of Severity was moderately correlated with a histological index, and it is therefore recommended for routine endoscopic mucosal evaluation in patients with UC.
The smallest of all the pathogens, viruses, have continuously been the foremost strange microorganisms. Viral infections can cause extreme sicknesses as evidenced by the HIV/AIDS widespread or the later Ebola or Zika episodes. Apprehensive framework distortions are also regularly observed as consequences of numerous viral infections. Besides, numerous viral infections are of oncoviruses, which can trigger different types of cancer. Nearly every year, a modern infectious species emerges, debilitating the world population with an annihilating episode. Subsequently, there is a need to create antivirals to combat such rising infections. From the discovery of the antiviral drug Idoxuridine in 1962 to the revelation of Baloxavir marboxil (Xofluza) that was approved by the FDA in 2018, the whole process and criteria of creating antivirals have changed significantly. In this article, different auxiliary science strategies are described that can serve as a referral for therapeutic innovation.
A translational frameshift is necessary in the synthesis of Escherichia coli release factor 2 (RF-2) to bypass an in-frame termination codon within the coding sequence. The nucleotide sequence preceding the in-phase stop codon within RF-2 mRNA is complementary to the 3' anti-(Shine-Dalgarno sequence) region found in prokaryotic 16S rRNA and Weiss et al. (1988) have concluded that this pairing triggers the frameshift event. In vitro production of RNA coding for RF-2, suitable for translation on eukaryotic ribosomes, has enabled testing of whether eukaryotic ribosomes can frameshift at this sequence. The 18S rRNA of eukaryotic ribosomes does not contain the 3' anti-(Shine-Dalgarno sequence) region. The prokaryotic RF-2 gene and the gene for the other release factor, RF-1, which does not contain an in-frame stop codon, were subcloned into transcription vectors such that the RNA transcripts produced in vitro would resemble a typical eukaryotic mRNA. These RF-1 and RF-2 RNAs both synthesized a major product of Mr approximately 45,000 when translated in vitro within reticulocyte lysate; the size expected for full length RF-1 and RF-2 molecules. The RF-2 product was immunoprecipitated by RF-2-specific antibodies, including those to regions of the protein encoded in the mRNA downstream from the frameshift site. The putative premature termination product, an oligopeptide of 25 amino acids, was not detected, but a chemically synthesized derivative was shown to be very unstable within the translation system. Although it was not possible therefore to calculate an absolute efficiency of frameshifting, the relative efficiency of the translation of RF-2 RNA was estimated to be 10-20% of that of RF-1 RNA in the reticulocyte system. This was similar to the relative synthesis of the two proteins in a plasmid-DNA-directed prokaryotic transcription/translation system. These results show that in vitro on eukaryotic ribosomes where the Shine-Dalgarno-type interaction is not possible, high efficiency frameshifting around the in-phase stop codon in the RF-2 mRNA can still occur.
Indian Hedgehog (Ihh)--Parathyroid related protein (PTHrP) and Fibroblast Growth Factor 3 (FGFR3) signaling pathways are important in regulating endochondral bone formation. In the growth plate, Ihh and PTHrP are involved in a feedback loop to increase proliferation and delay differentiation of chondrocytes. Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 3 (FGFR3) conversely decreases proliferation and hastens differentiation with an agonist. Since proliferation is the hallmark of chondrosarcoma cells, we hypothesized that Ihh/PTHrP and FGF3R pathways may be dysfunctional on these cells. Therefore, we sought to investigate the role of these signaling pathways in the Swarm rat chondrosarcoma cells utilizing expression and functional studies. Semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis demonstrated difference in expression between normal growth plate chondrocytes and chondrosarcoma cells (JWS). JWS had an increased mRNA expression of FGF2 and FGFR3 suggesting a mechanism to reverse the proliferative rate of the cells. Immunohistochemical analysis showed increased staining for FGFR3 and patched-1 (Ihh receptor) in JWS compared to the rat tibia growth plate (p = 0.O004 and 0.02 respectively). In vitro functional experiments demonstrated that the use of FGF2, a FGFR3 receptor agonist, dramatically decreased the proliferative rate of Swarm chondrosarcoma cells (LTC). Cyclopamine, a hedgehog inhibitor, did not have a significant effect on their proliferative rate. However, when cyclopamine was used on normal chondrocytes, it effectively decreased the proliferative rate of these cells, suggesting abnormalities in this pathway in the chondrosarcoma cells. In conclusion, our investigation describes dissimilarity in the Indian Hedgehog and FGFR3 signaling pathways between the rat chondrosarcoma cells and native rat chondrocytes. Understanding the underlying mechanisms may provide a target for future therapy for chondrosarcoma.
BACKGROUND: Stroke in crack-cocaine abusers is increasingly recognized. We aimed to identify significant differences in stroke risk factors, characteristics, and outcomes between hospitalized stroke patients with and without crack-cocaine abuse.METHODS: This was a retrospective study that compared stroke patients with crack-cocaine abuse (cases) to stroke patients without crack-cocaine (controls).RESULTS: We identified 93 crack-cocaine cases and 93 controls admitted between January 2004 and May 2006 to one teaching hospital. There were significant differences between crack-cocaine cases and controls in age (48.7 years vs. 55 years) (P = 0.0001), male gender (65.6% vs. 40.9%) (odds ratios, OR = 1.64, 95% CI 1.22-2.21), arterial hypertension (61.1% vs. 83.9%) (OR = 0.30, 95% CI 0.15-0.60), hypercholesterolemia (18.7% vs. 68.5%) (OR = 0.10, 95% CI 0.05-0.21), diabetes (20.9% vs. 41.9%) (OR = 0.36, 95% CI 0.19-0.70), cigarette smoking (70.6% vs. 29%) (OR = 5.86, 95% CI 3.07-11.20), ischemic stroke (61.3% vs. 79.6%) (OR = 0.40, 95% CI 0.21-0.78), and intracerebral hemorrhage (33.3% vs. 17.2%) (OR = 3.03, 95% CI 1.53-6.00). Also, there were significant differences in National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale scores (3.3 vs. 7) (P < 0.0001), and MRS scores (1.8 vs. 2.5) (P = 0.0022) at hospital discharge. Using univariable and multivariable logistic regression, we found that crack-cocaine abusers had 2.28 higher odds of having a favorable functional outcome (MRS score ≤ 2) at hospital discharge, after adjusting for stroke risk factors and characteristics.CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that crack-cocaine abusers with stroke had fewer traditional risk factors, and more favorable functional outcome as compared to non-crack-cocaine abusers.
An adjustment of sex ratio of offspring to the conditions present at conception is seen in many mammals including horses. This depends on preferential survival of male embryos under conditions of high energy intake. In several species, growth factors including insulin like growth factor (IGF)-1 have been shown to promote embryonic development by decreasing apoptosis and increasing cell proliferation. We hypothesized that sex-related differences in IGF-1 expression in equine embryos during the phase of maternal recognition of pregnancy might exist and thus contribute to preferential survival of embryos from either of both sexes under specific environmental conditions. Insulin like growth factor-1 mRNA expression of in vivo-produced equine embryos on different days of pregnancy (Day 8, N = 6; Day 10, N = 8; Day 12, N = 14) was analyzed. Insulin like growth factor-1 mRNA expression was evaluated by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The sex of the embryo was determined by detection of X-inactivation specific transcript (Xist) RNA and equine sex determining region of the Y chromosome DNA. Embryos positive for Xist expression were classified as female, and Xist negative and equine sex determining region of the Y chromosome positive embryos were classified as male. From 28 embryos tested, 15 (54%) showed positive Xist expression and were thus classified as female. Insulin like growth factor-1 mRNA expression was influenced by sex (P = 0.01) but not by day of pregnancy (relative expression of IGF-1 in relation to β-actin, Day 8: male 5.1 ± 2.1, female 11.4; Day 10: male 5.2 ± 1.6, female 17.4 ± 6.7; Day 12: male 2.6 ± 0.3, female 11.6 ± 2.4). Results demonstrate an increased expression of IGF-1 in female equine embryos. Sex-related influences on expression of the IGF system are probably related to a gradual X chromosome inactivation.
BRAF represents one of the most frequently mutated protein kinase genes in human tumours. The mutation is commonly tested in pathology practice. BRAF mutation is seen in melanoma, papillary thyroid carcinoma (including papillary thyroid carcinoma arising from ovarian teratoma), ovarian serous tumours, colorectal carcinoma, gliomas, hepatobiliary carcinomas and hairy cell leukaemia. In these cancers, various genetic aberrations of the BRAF proto-oncogene, such as different point mutations and chromosomal rearrangements, have been reported. The most common mutation, BRAF V600E, can be detected by DNA sequencing and immunohistochemistry on formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tumour tissue. Detection of BRAF V600E mutation has the potential for clinical use as a diagnostic and prognostic marker. In addition, a great deal of research effort has been spent in strategies inhibiting its activity. Indeed, recent clinical trials involving BRAF selective inhibitors exhibited promising response rates in metastatic melanoma patients. Clinical trials are underway for other cancers. However, cutaneous side effects of treatment have been reported and therapeutic response to cancer is short-lived due to the emergence of several resistance mechanisms. In this review, we give an update on the clinical pathological relevance of BRAF mutation in cancer. It is hoped that the review will enhance the direction of future research and assist in more effective use of the knowledge of BRAF mutation in clinical practice.
OBJECTIVE: Negative symptoms are core features of schizophrenia that are functionally debilitating, associated with poor outcomes, and resistant to existing pharmacotherapies. We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of modafinil, a medication approved for the treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness, to explore its efficacy as an adjunctive therapy for negative symptoms in schizophrenia.METHOD: Twenty subjects with DSM-IV schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder were randomly assigned to double-blind treatment with modafinil or placebo for 8 weeks. The study ran from March 2002 through March 2006. Outcome measures included the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS), Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) scale, Quality of Life Interview, neurocognitive assessments (California Verbal Learning Test, Degraded Performance-Continuous Performance Test, Trail-Making Test B), and somatic measures (sleep, weight, side effects).RESULTS: Modafinil treatment was associated with a greater rate (CGI-Improvement [CGI-I] score < or = 3, 7/10 vs. 1/10) and degree (mean CGI-I score, 3.2 vs. 4.1) of global improvement at study endpoint compared with placebo. However, modafinil did not significantly improve global negative symptoms as measured by the total SANS or SANS individual global items. Modafinil did not significantly worsen psycho-pathology (according to the BPRS), compared with placebo, and was well tolerated.CONCLUSIONS: Although no effect on negative symptoms was found, adjunctive therapy with modafinil may result in global improvements in patients with schizophrenia who have prominent negative symptoms.
The recent identification of germline and somatic mutations in BAP1 as well as in multiple members of the ASXL (additional sex combs-like) family of genes has highlighted the role of these proteins in a diverse array of biological functions. A diverse number of possible functions have previously been ascribed to ASXL1 in non-hematopoietic contexts, including physical co-operativity with HP1a and LSD1. Here we discuss new evidence for a BAP1-independent function of ASXL1 in regulating histone H3 lysine 27 methylation through interactions with the Polycomb-repressive complex 2 (PRC2). BAP1, a nuclear-localized deubiquitinase, has been shown to interact with a number of proteins, including ASXL1 and/or ASXL2, but the functional importance of this interaction has remained elusive. Here, we highlight recent work revealing the critical function of BAP1 in restricting myelopoiesis and in regulating hematopoietic stem cell function. These data provide evidence that BAP1 and ASXL1 function as a novel class of tumor suppressors in myeloid malignancies. BAP1 functions through effects on stability of host cell factor-1, and O-GlcNAcylation, and ASXL1 impacts histone post-translational modifications through interaction with PRC2. Future studies investigating the mechanism of transformation by loss of BAP1 and ASXL1 may result in new therapeutic approaches to treat hematological malignancies.
BACKGROUND: Postnatal and antenatal anti-D prophylaxis have dramatically reduced maternal sensitisations and cases of rhesus disease in babies born to women with RhD negative blood group. Recent scientific advances mean that non-invasive prenatal diagnosis (NIPD), based on the presence of cell-free fetal DNA in maternal plasma, could be used to target prophylaxis on "at risk" pregnancies where the fetus is RhD positive. This paper provides the first assessment of cost-effectiveness of NIPD-targeted prophylaxis compared to current policies.METHODS: We conducted an economic analysis of NIPD implementation in England and Wales. Two scenarios were considered. Scenario 1 assumed that NIPD will be only used to target antenatal prophylaxis with serology tests continuing to direct post-delivery prophylaxis. In Scenario 2, NIPD would also displace postnatal serology testing if an RhD negative fetus was identified. Costs were estimated from the provider's perspective for both scenarios together with a threshold royalty fee per test. Incremental costs were compared with clinical implications.RESULTS: The basic cost of an NIPD in-house test is £16.25 per sample (excluding royalty fee). The two-dose antenatal prophylaxis policy recommended by NICE is estimated to cost the NHS £3.37 million each year. The estimated threshold royalty fee is £2.18 and £8.83 for Scenarios 1 and 2 respectively. At a £2.00 royalty fee, mass NIPD testing would produce no saving for Scenario 1 and £507,154 per annum for Scenario 2. Incremental cost-effectiveness analysis indicates that, at a test sensitivity of 99.7% and this royalty fee, NIPD testing in Scenario 2 will generate one additional sensitisation for every £9,190 saved. If a single-dose prophylaxis policy were implemented nationally, as recently recommended by NICE, Scenario 2 savings would fall.CONCLUSIONS: Currently, NIPD testing to target anti-D prophylaxis is unlikely to be sufficiently cost-effective to warrant its large scale introduction in England and Wales. Only minor savings are calculated and, balanced against this, the predicted increase in maternal sensitisations may be unacceptably high. Reliability of NIPD assays still needs to be demonstrated rigorously in different ethnic minority populations. First trimester testing is unlikely to alter this picture significantly although other emerging technologies may.
A technique is described to directly measure ongoing transcription from individual genes in permeabilized cells of either the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae or the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Transcription run-on (TRO) analysis is used to compare the relative rates of synthesis for specific transcripts in cells grown under different environmental conditions or harvested at different stages of development. As the amount of an individual RNA species present at any given time is determined by its net rate of synthesis and degradation, an accurate picture of transcription per se can be obtained only by directly measuring de novo synthesis of RNA (if you are interested in RNA degradation, see Method for measuring mRNA decay rate in Saccharomyces cerevisiae). Most techniques employed to measure changes in the relative levels of individual transcripts present under different conditions, including Northern analysis (see Northern blotting), RT-PCR (see Reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR)), nuclease protection assays (see Explanatory Chapter: Nuclease Protection Assays), and genome-wide assays, such as microarray analysis and high throughput RNA sequencing, measure changes in the steady-state level of a transcript, which may or may not reflect the actual changes in transcription of the gene. Recent studies carried out in fission yeast have demonstrated that increases in the steady-state level (accumulation) of many individual mRNAs occur without any significant changes in transcription rates (McPheeters et al., 2009), highlighting the important role of regulated RNA stability in determining gene expression programs (Harigaya et al., 2006).
Here we show that pemetrexed-treated mesothelioma cells undergo accelerated senescence. This is characterized by the secretion of proinflammatory and mitogenic cytokines, reminiscent of an SASP (senescence-associated secretory phenotype). Conditioned media from senescent MPM (malignant pleural mesothelioma) cells trigger the emergence of EMT (epithelial-to-mesenchymal)-like, clonogenic and chemoresistant cell subpopulations, expressing high levels of ALDH (aldehyde dehydrogenase) activity (ALDH(bright) cells). We show by fluorescence-activated cell sorting of purified ALDH(bright) and ALDH(low) cells, that both cell-autonomous and cell-non-autonomous mechanisms converge to maintain the SASP-induced, EMT-like cell subpopulations. Chemoresistant ALDH(bright) cells exist within primary MPM specimens and enrichment for ALDH(bright) cells correlates with an earlier tumor onset into NOD/SCID mice. We show that RAS(v12) expression induces SASP-like changes in untransformed human mesothelial cells, and that p53 ablation increases the effect of RAS(v12) expression. We identify STAT3 activation as a crucial event downstream to SASP signaling. In fact, small hairpin RNA-mediated ablation of STAT3 deeply attenuates the induction of EMT genes and the increase of ALDH(bright) cells induced by SASP-cytokines. This strongly affects the chemoresistance of MPM cells in vitro and leads to anticancer effects in vivo.
PURPOSE: Dominant mutations in the STXBP1 gene are a recently identified cause of infantile epileptic encephalopathy without metabolic and structural brain anomalies. To date, 25 patients with heterozygous mutation or deletion of STXBP1 have been reported. A diagnosis of early infantile epileptic encephalopathy with suppression-burst (Ohtahara syndrome) was made in most of them, with infantile spasms and nonsyndromic infantile epileptic encephalopathy being the diagnosis in other patients. Although the phenotypic spectrum of STXBP1-related encephalopathy is emerging with evidence suggesting the relatively frequent involvement of this gene in infantile epileptic encephalopathies, accurate clinical descriptions of patients are still necessary to delineate this entity.METHODS: The sequence of the STXPB1 gene was analyzed in 29 patients with early onset syndromic or nonsyndromic infantile epileptic encephalopathy without brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) anomalies and with normal chromosomal and metabolic checkup. Another patient with a complex phenotype was analyzed by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) array.KEY FINDINGS: From the studied series, 2 of 29 patients were found to carry a de novo heterozygous mutation in STXBP1. One patient carried the recurrent p.Arg406His mutation and the other an insertion of 10 bases leading to a premature termination codon. CGH array experiment detected a deletion of 3-3.5 Mbp in the third patient with infantile epileptic encephalopathy and nail malformations. All three had infantile spasms associated with partial seizures that responded to antiepileptic drug therapy. Intellectual abilities were severely impaired in all of them. Generalized tremor was the main neurologic striking feature in the three patients, with one of them further displaying unilateral akinetic-hypertonic syndrome.SIGNIFICANCE: Mutations in STXBP1 are relatively frequent in patients with infantile epileptic encephalopathies. STXBP1-related encephalopathy may present as drug-responsive infantile spasms with focal/lateralized discharges. Generalized tremor appearing after the first year of life may be a clue to the diagnosis in some patients.
Polycomb group proteins are essential regulators of stem cell function during embryonic development and in adult tissue homeostasis. Bmi1, a key component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1, is highly expressed in undifferentiated neural stem cells (NSC) as well as in several human cancers including high-grade gliomas--highly aggressive brain tumors. Using a conditional gene activation approach in mice, we show that overexpression of Bmi1 induces repressive epigenetic regulation of the promoter of Survivin, a well-characterized antiapoptotic protein. This phenomenon is cell type-specific and it leads to apoptotic death of progenitor cells exclusively upon commitment toward a neuronal fate. Moreover, we show that this is triggered by increased oxidative stress-induced DNA damage. In contrast, undifferentiated NSC as well as glioma-initiating cells display an open chromatin configuration at the Survivin promoter and do not undergo apoptotic death. These findings raise the possibility that normal and neoplastic stem cells depend on the same mechanism for surviving the hyperproliferative state induced by increased Bmi1 expression.
Angelman syndrome (AS) is caused by a lack of expression of the maternally inherited UBE3A gene in the brain. However, about 10% of individuals with a clinical diagnosis of AS do not have an identifiable molecular defect. It is likely that most of those individuals have an AS-like syndrome that is clinically and molecularly distinct from AS. These AS-like syndromes can be broadly classified into chromosomal microdeletion and microduplication syndromes, and single-gene disorders. The microdeletion/microduplication syndromes are now easily identified by chromosomal microarray analysis and include Phelan–McDermid syndrome (chromosome 22q13.3 deletion), MBD5 haploinsufficiency syndrome (chromosome 2q23.1 deletion), and KANSL1 haploinsufficiency syndrome (chromosome 17q21.31 deletion). The single-gene disorders include Pitt–Hopkins syndrome (TCF4), Christianson syndrome (SLC9A6), Mowat–Wilson syndrome (ZEB2), Kleefstra syndrome (EHMT1), and Rett (MECP2) syndrome. They also include disorders due to mutations in HERC2, adenylosuccinase lyase (ADSL), CDKL5, FOXG1, MECP2 (duplications), MEF2C, and ATRX. Although many of these single-gene disorders can be caused by chromosomal microdeletions resulting in haploinsufficiency of the critical gene, the individual disorders are often caused by intragenic mutations that cannot be detected by chromosomal microarray analysis. We provide an overview of the clinical features of these syndromes, comparing and contrasting them with AS, in the hope that it will help guide clinicians in the diagnostic work-up of individuals with AS-like syndromes.
Among the criteria to evaluate the performance of a phylogenetic method, robustness to model violation is of particular practical importance as complete a priori knowledge of evolutionary processes is typically unavailable. For studies of robustness in phylogenetic inference, a utility to add well-defined model violations to the simulated data would be helpful. We therefore introduce ImOSM, a tool to imbed intermittent evolution as model violation into an alignment. Intermittent evolution refers to extra substitutions occurring randomly on branches of a tree, thus changing alignment site patterns. This means that the extra substitutions are placed on the tree after the typical process of sequence evolution is completed. We then study the robustness of widely used phylogenetic methods: maximum likelihood (ML), maximum parsimony (MP), and a distance-based method (BIONJ) to various scenarios of model violation. Violation of rates across sites (RaS) heterogeneity and simultaneous violation of RaS and the transition/transversion ratio on two nonadjacent external branches hinder all the methods recovery of the true topology for a four-taxon tree. For an eight-taxon balanced tree, the violations cause each of the three methods to infer a different topology. Both ML and MP fail, whereas BIONJ, which calculates the distances based on the ML estimated parameters, reconstructs the true tree. Finally, we report that a test of model homogeneity and goodness of fit tests have enough power to detect such model violations. The outcome of the tests can help to actually gain confidence in the inferred trees. Therefore, we recommend using these tests in practical phylogenetic analyses.
The Mediator complex regulates transcription by connecting enhancers to promoters. High Mediator binding density defines super enhancers, which regulate cell-identity genes and oncogenes. Protein interactions of Mediator may explain its role in these processes but have not been identified comprehensively. Here, we purify Mediator from neural stem cells (NSCs) and identify 75 protein-protein interaction partners. We identify super enhancers in NSCs and show that Mediator-interacting chromatin modifiers colocalize with Mediator at enhancers and super enhancers. Transcription factor families with high affinity for Mediator dominate enhancers and super enhancers and can explain genome-wide Mediator localization. We identify E-box transcription factor Tcf4 as a key regulator of NSCs. Tcf4 interacts with Mediator, colocalizes with Mediator at super enhancers and regulates neurogenic transcription factor genes with super enhancers and broad H3K4me3 domains. Our data suggest that high binding-affinity for Mediator is an important organizing feature in the transcriptional network that determines NSC identity.
Since Jacob and Monod's characterization of the role of DNA elements in gene control, it has been recognized that the linear organization of genome structure is important for the regulation of gene transcription and hence the manifestation of phenotypes. Similarly, it has long been hypothesized that the spatial organization (in three dimensions evolving through time), as part of the epigenome, makes a significant contribution to the genotype-phenotype transition. Proximity ligation assays commonly known as chromosome conformation capture (3C) and 3C based methodologies (e.g., GCC, HiC and ChIA-Pet) are increasingly being incorporated into empirical studies to investigate the role that three-dimensional genome structure plays in the regulation of phenotype. The apparent simplicity of these methodologies-crosslink chromatin, digest, dilute, ligate, detect interactions-belies the complexity of the data and the considerations that should be taken into account to ensure the generation and accurate interpretation of reliable data. Here we discuss the probabilistic nature of these methodologies and how this contributes to their endogenous limitations.
Angiogenesis plays an important role in the progression of tumor. Besides being regulated by tumor cells per se, tumor angiogenesis is also influenced by stromal cells in tumor microenvironment (TME), for example, tumor associated macrophages (TAMs). Activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), a member of the ATF/CREB family, has been reported to be related to tumor angiogenesis. In this study, we found that exogenous overexpression of ATF4 in mouse breast cancer cells promotes tumor growth via increasing tumor microvascular density. However, ATF4 overexpression failed to increase the expression level of a series of proangiogenic factors including vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) in tumor cells in this model. Thus, we further investigated the infiltration of proangiogenic macrophages in tumor tissues and found that ATF4-overexpressing tumors could recruit more macrophages via secretion of macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF). Overall, we concluded that exogenous overexpression of ATF4 in breast cancer cells may facilitate the recruitment of macrophages into tumor tissues and promote tumor angiogenesis and tumor growth indirectly.
IMPORTANCE: Propranolol therapy is changing the treatment paradigm for infantile hemangioma. This study addresses the effect of propranolol therapy on the treatment of nasal infantile hemangioma (NIH), an area that often does not respond to medical therapy.OBJECTIVE: To determine if propranolol treatment is associated with fewer invasive treatments for NIH.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective cohort study conducted within a single pediatric institution's multidisciplinary vascular anomaly program for patients with NIH treated between January 1, 2003, and December 31, 2011. Three NIH cohorts were compared: prepropranolol (20 in group 1; 2003-2009), propranolol (25 in group 2; 2009-2011), and nonpropranolol (13 in group 3; 2009-2011) treatment.INTERVENTIONS: Analysis of systemic medical, laser, or surgical therapies for NIH.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The study plan was created to detect a change in invasive therapy for NIH. Data collected included presenting age, sex, affected nasal subunits, infantile hemangioma morphologic characteristics, treatment type and number, and primary treating service. An NIH grading system, based on nasal subunit involvement, helped quantify treatment change. Descriptive statistics summarized data, and a Cox proportional hazards regression model evaluated propranolol use and the likelihood of invasive treatments (surgical excision or laser).RESULTS: Of the 95 patients identified, 58 met inclusion criteria: 20 in group 1 (mean age, 4.8 months), 25 in group 2 (mean age, 4.9 months), and 13 in group 3 (mean age, 4.9 months). Nasal infantile hemangiomas involved the nasal tip subunit in 33 of 58 patients (56.9%). Eight of 13 patients (61.5%) in group 3 frequently had small NIH (grade 1). Patients in group 2 were less likely to undergo any invasive treatments (relative risk, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.27-0.73), have surgical excision only (0.45; 0.15-1.38), or undergo laser treatment only (0.44; 0.27-0.78) compared with those in group 1. Patients with higher-grade NIH had more medical or invasive therapy, but invasive procedures were carried out in each subgroup defined by grade.CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Patients with isolated propranolol-treated NIH were less likely to undergo invasive treatment, but despite its implementation, the need for invasive treatment was not totally supplanted by its use.

The crystal structure of the protein postsynaptic neurotoxin, erabutoxin b, has been refined at 0.140-nm resolution (R = 0.22) by restrained least-squares and interactive computer graphics. The study has established complete structural identity of the two sea-snake venom toxins, erabutoxin b and neurotoxin b, isolated from Laticauda semifasciata snakes taken in different Pacific Ocean waters. Two chemical-sequence inversion errors in erabutoxin b have been discovered during refinement, corrected and subsequently confirmed in both erabutoxin b and erabutoxin a by chemical analysis. The correct sequences are His6-Gln7, hitherto unsuspected, and Ser18-Pro19. The sequence correction His6-Gln7 explains the anomalous results of 1H NMR solution studies and those of early chemical modification experiments, which were in conflict with the previously published three-dimensional structure of erabutoxin b. On refinement, the five-stranded beta sheet described earlier is now shown to be discontinuous, split into a two-stranded beta loop and a three-stranded beta sheet. Unique features of the Pro44-Gly49 peripheral segment have now been identified. 51 water molecule positions have been located.
Traditional technologies to investigate system biology are limited by the detection of parameters resulting from the averages of large populations of cells, missing cells produced in small numbers, and attempting to uniform the heterogeneity. The advent of proteomics and genomics at a single-cell level has set the basis for an outstanding improvement in analytical technology and data acquisition. It has been well demonstrated that cellular heterogeneity is closely related to numerous stochastic transcriptional events leading to variations in patterns of expression among single genetically identical cells. The new-generation technology of single-cell analysis is able to better characterize a cell's population, identifying and differentiating outlier cells, in order to provide both a single-cell experiment and a corresponding bulk measurement, through the identification, quantification and characterization of all system biology aspects (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, degradomics and fluxomics). The movement of omics into single-cell analysis represents a significant and outstanding shift.
OBJECTIVES: The present study was aimed to determine whether trefoil factor family (TFF) peptides which were generally considered to be resistant to proteolysis could be digested by gingipains, a major proteinases produced by Porphyromonas gingivalis.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Recombinant human TFF1, TFF2, and TFF3 peptides were used as substrates. Gingipains including arginine gingipain (RgpB) and lysine gingipain (Kgp) were used as enzymes. Trypsin was used as a control protease. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization with time-of-flight / time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF/TOF) and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) were used for analyzing peptide mass signals and amino acid sequences of digested TFF peptides.RESULTS: MALDI-TOF/TOF analyses demonstrated that Kgp, RgpB, and trypsin were able to cleave TFF1 and TFF2 peptides, resulting in different patterns of digested fragments. However, impurity in recombinant TFF3 peptide substrates affected the interpretations of enzymatic reaction by MALDI-TOF/TOF. LC-MS analyses demonstrated that identified fragments of TFF1, TFF2, and TFF3 from digestion by gingipains were similar to those by trypsin.CONCLUSIONS: Using MALDI-TOF/TOF and LC-MS, the present study provides new information that gingipains containing trypsin-like activities are able to digest TFF peptides.CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The proteolytic effects of gingipains on TFF peptides may be responsible for reduction of salivary TFF peptides in chronic periodontitis patients. Further investigations to determine the pathological effects of gingipains on TFF peptides in saliva and periodontal tissues of patients with chronic periodontitis would be of interest.
Primary mucosal melanoma of the oral cavity is an exceedingly rare neoplasm which is estimated to comprise 1-2% of all oral malignancies. In contrast to cutaneous melanomas, the risk factors and pathogenesis are poorly understood. The predominate localization of primary oral melanoma is hard palate and maxillary alveolus. Dermoscopy may be utilized as an adjunctive tool in the clinical differential diagnosis of oral mucosal melanoma whenever the lesion is accessible with a dermoscope. Surgery is the mainstay of treatment, but it may be challenging depending on the location of the tumor within the oral cavity and its size. Adjuvant therapy with dacarbazine, platinum analogs, nitrosoureas and interleukin-2 have been utilized with low response rates. Imatinib may be effective for patients with with c-Kit gene mutations. Sunitinib and dasatinib have been reported effective in selected cases. Vemurafenib and dabrafenib are targeted agents for patients with BRAF mutation-positive melanoma. Ipilimumab, an anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 antibody and pembrolizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting programmed death 1 receptor may be a feasible treatment option in patients with metastatic mucosal melanoma.
PURPOSE: Siltuximab (IL6 antibody) is approved for the treatment of multicentric Castleman disease (MCD). Effects of IL6 inhibition on the inflammatory milieu accompanying MCD have not been characterized.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Trends in inflammatory- and anemia-associated markers, measured over the course of a placebo-controlled study of siltuximab (11 mg/kg q3w) in patients with MCD (n = 79), were characterized.RESULTS: Baseline IL6 and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were significantly correlated (r = 0.708; P < 0.0001). CRP levels decreased (median, 92%) by cycle 1 day 8 (C1D8), remaining suppressed during siltuximab treatment while remaining stable in the placebo group. There were no associations between baseline CRP or IL6 and MCD symptom burden, histologic subtype, ethnicity, maximum CRP decrease, and response parameters. A hemoglobin response (change ≥ 15 g/L at week 13) was observed with siltuximab (61%; P = 0.0002). Median hepcidin decrease from baseline at C1D8 with siltuximab was 47% versus median 11% increase with placebo. Maximum post-baseline changes in hepcidin levels among siltuximab recipients were correlated with maximum changes for hemoglobin (r = -0.395; P = 0.00607), total iron-binding capacity (TIBC; r = -0.354; P = 0.01694), and ferritin (r = 0.599; P = 0.0001). Greater median changes from baseline in ferritin, hemoglobin, and TIBC were observed in anemic siltuximab-treated patients.CONCLUSIONS: IL6 neutralization with siltuximab resulted in sustained CRP suppression and improvement of anemia, in part, by hepcidin pathway inhibition.
BACKGROUND: Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is characterized by idiopathic dilatation and systolic contractile dysfunction of the ventricle(s) leading to an impaired systolic function. The origin of DCM is heterogeneous, but genetic transmission of the disease accounts for up to 50% of the cases. Mutations in alpha-tropomyosin (TPM1), a thin filament protein involved in structural and regulatory roles in muscle cells, are associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and very rarely with DCM.METHODS AND RESULTS: Here we present a large four-generation family in which DCM is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. Six family members have a cardiomyopathy with the age of diagnosis ranging from 5 months to 52 years. The youngest affected was diagnosed with dilated and non-compaction cardiomyopathy (NCCM) and died at the age of five. Three additional children died young of suspected heart problems. We mapped the phenotype to chromosome 15 and subsequently identified a missense mutation in TPM1, resulting in a p.D84N amino acid substitution. In addition we sequenced 23 HCM/DCM genes using next generation sequencing. The TPM1 p.D84N was the only mutation identified. The mutation co-segregates with all clinically affected family members and significantly weakens the binding of tropomyosin to actin by 25%.CONCLUSIONS: We show that a mutation in TPM1 is associated with DCM and a lethal, early onset form of NCCM, probably as a result of diminished actin binding caused by weakened charge-charge interactions. Consequently, the screening of TPM1 in patients and families with DCM and/or (severe, early onset forms of) NCCM is warranted. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Cardiomyocyte Biology: Cardiac Pathways of Differentiation, Metabolism and Contraction.
BACKGROUND: T2w-CMR is used widely to assess myocardial edema. Quantitative T1-mapping is also sensitive to changes in free water content. We hypothesized that T1-mapping would have a higher diagnostic performance in detecting acute edema than dark-blood and bright-blood T2w-CMR.METHODS: We investigated 21 controls (55 ± 13 years) and 21 patients (61 ± 10 years) with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy or acute regional myocardial edema without infarction. CMR performed within 7 days included cine, T1-mapping using ShMOLLI, dark-blood T2-STIR, bright-blood ACUT2E and LGE imaging. We analyzed wall motion, myocardial T1 values and T2 signal intensity (SI) ratio relative to both skeletal muscle and remote myocardium.RESULTS: All patients had acute cardiac symptoms, increased Troponin I (0.15-36.80 ug/L) and acute wall motion abnormalities but no LGE. T1 was increased in patient segments with abnormal and normal wall motion compared to controls (1113 ± 94 ms, 1029 ± 59 ms and 944 ± 17 ms, respectively; p < 0.001). T2 SI ratio using STIR and ACUT2E was also increased in patient segments with abnormal and normal wall motion compared to controls (all p < 0.02). Receiver operator characteristics analysis showed that T1-mapping had a significantly larger area-under-the-curve (AUC = 0.94) compared to T2-weighted methods, whether the reference ROI was skeletal muscle or remote myocardium (AUC = 0.58-0.89; p < 0.03). A T1 value of greater than 990 ms most optimally differentiated segments affected by edema from normal segments at 1.5 T, with a sensitivity and specificity of 92 %.CONCLUSIONS: Non-contrast T1-mapping using ShMOLLI is a novel method for objectively detecting myocardial edema with a high diagnostic performance. T1-mapping may serve as a complementary technique to T2-weighted imaging for assessing myocardial edema in ischemic and non-ischemic heart disease, such as quantifying area-at-risk and diagnosing myocarditis.
DBP, HLF and TEF comprise a distinct subfamily of mammalian bZIP proteins that plays an important role in regulation of tissue-specific gene expression, particularly in the liver. In this report we demonstrate that DBP contains a 38 amino acid TAD which is highly homologous to the HLF and TEF TADs that we have delineated previously. Deletion of this domain completely abrogates transcriptional activity of native DBP and GAL4-DBP fusion proteins. This domain functions as a modular TAD that is a potent transcriptional activator when fused to the GAL4 DBD. While DBP itself is a liver-specific transactivator, the DBP TAD is active in a variety of cell types, indicating that liver-specific activity is not an intrinsic property of the TAD and must be conferred by other regions of the protein. Using GAL4-HLF fusion proteins, we further refine the core TAD of PAR proteins to a region of 13 amino acids. Recently described PAR-bZIP proteins from Drosophila and zebrafish also contain domains that share strong homology with the TAD of mammalian PAR proteins, making this one of the most highly evolutionarily conserved TADs identified to date.
CpG dinucleotides provide hotspots for transitional mutations in a variety of genes, some leading to genetic diseases in humans. Although this phenomenon is attributed to cytosine methylation at such sites, direct and specific observations of CpG methylation at the sites of recurrent mutations are lacking. We have used a bisulfite genomic sequencing method to analyze DNA methylation within three representative exons from the neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) gene, well recognized for its high frequency of spontaneous mutations. We observed that the cytosine methylation within NF1 exons 28, 29, and 31 is restricted to CpG dinucleotides, including the CpG dinucleotide present at the site of the recurrent NF1 mutation (C5839T; also referred to as R1947X). At several sites, clone-specific methylation differences were also observed. Our results provide experimental evidence for the hypothesis that methylatable CpGs in the NF1 gene contribute to spontaneous germline mutations associated with this gene, by showing that DNA methylation does occur at all CpGs contained within these representative NF1 exons. As well, the DNA methylation seen at the common mutation site in exon 31 may explain why this site is frequently mutated. Methylation-dependent mutagenesis may also provide a basis for some somatic (second hit) mutations which disable the normal allele and result in the development of NF1 associated symptoms.

Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a neurobehavioral disorder manifested by infantile hypotonia and feeding difficulties in infancy, followed by morbid obesity secondary to hyperphagia. It is caused by deficiency of paternally expressed transcript(s) within the human chromosome region 15q11.2. PWS patients harboring balanced chromosomal translocations with breakpoints within small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypeptide N (SNRPN) have provided indirect evidence for a role for the imprinted C/D box containing small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) genes encoded downstream of SNRPN. In addition, recently published data provide strong evidence in support of a role for the snoRNA SNORD116 cluster (HBII-85) in PWS etiology. In this study, we performed detailed phenotypic, cytogenetic, and molecular analyses including chromosome analysis, array comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH), expression studies, and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping for parent-of-origin determination of the 15q11.2 microdeletion on an 11-year-old child expressing the major components of the PWS phenotype. This child had an ∼236.29 kb microdeletion at 15q11.2 within the larger Prader-Willi/Angelman syndrome critical region that included the SNORD116 cluster of snoRNAs. Analysis of SNP genotypes in proband and mother provided evidence in support of the deletion being on the paternal chromosome 15. This child also met most of the major PWS diagnostic criteria including infantile hypotonia, early-onset morbid obesity, and hypogonadism. Identification and characterization of this case provide unequivocal evidence for a critical role for the SNORD116 snoRNA molecules in PWS pathogenesis. Array CGH testing for genomic copy-number changes in cases with complex phenotypes is proving to be invaluable in detecting novel alterations and enabling better genotype-phenotype correlations.
Genome-wide studies have identified thousands of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) lacking protein-coding capacity. However, most lncRNAs are expressed at a very low level, and in most cases there is no genetic evidence to support their in vivo function. Malat1 (metastasis associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1) is among the most abundant and highly conserved lncRNAs, and it exhibits an uncommon 3'-end processing mechanism. In addition, its specific nuclear localization, developmental regulation, and dysregulation in cancer are suggestive of it having a critical biological function. We have characterized a Malat1 loss-of-function genetic model that indicates that Malat1 is not essential for mouse pre- and postnatal development. Furthermore, depletion of Malat1 does not affect global gene expression, splicing factor level and phosphorylation status, or alternative pre-mRNA splicing. However, among a small number of genes that were dysregulated in adult Malat1 knockout mice, many were Malat1 neighboring genes, thus indicating a potential cis-regulatory role of Malat1 gene transcription.
Several anti-amyloid β (Aβ) antibodies are under evaluation for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Clinical studies using the N-terminal-directed anti-Aβ antibody bapineuzumab have demonstrated reduced brain PET-Pittsburg-B signals, suggesting the reduction of Aβ plaques, and reduced levels of total and phosphorylated tau protein in the CSF of treated AD patients. Preclinical studies using 3D6 (the murine form of bapineuzumab) have demonstrated resolution of Aβ plaque and vascular burdens, neuritic dystrophy, and preservation of synaptic density in the transgenic APP mouse models. In contrast, few studies have evaluated the direct interaction of this antibody with synaptotoxic soluble Aβ species. In the current report, we demonstrated that 3D6 binds to soluble, synaptotoxic assemblies of Aβ(1-42) and prevents multiple downstream functional consequences in rat hippocampal neurons including changes in glutamate AMPA receptor trafficking, AD-type tau phosphorylation, and loss of dendritic spines. In vivo, we further demonstrated that 3D6 prevents synaptic loss and acutely reverses the behavioral deficit in the contextual fear conditioning task in transgenic mouse models of AD, two endpoints thought to be linked to synaptotoxic soluble Aβ moieties. Importantly C-terminal anti-Aβ antibodies were ineffective on these endpoints. These results, taken with prior studies, suggest that N-terminal anti-Aβ antibodies effectively interact with both soluble and insoluble forms of Aβ and therefore appear particularly well suited for testing the Aβ hypothesis of AD.
DNA methylation is a major epigenetic modification and plays a crucial role in the regulation of gene expression. Within the family of DNA methyltransferases (Dnmts), Dnmt3a and 3b establish methylation marks during early development, while Dnmt1 maintains methylation patterns after DNA replication. The maintenance function of Dnmt1 is regulated by its large regulatory N-terminal domain that interacts with other chromatin factors and is essential for the recognition of hemi-methylated DNA. Gelfiltration analysis showed that purified Dnmt1 elutes at an apparent molecular weight corresponding to the size of a dimer. With protein interaction assays we could show that Dnmt1 interacts with itself through its N-terminal regulatory domain. By deletion analysis and co-immunoprecipitations we mapped the dimerization domain to the targeting sequence TS that is located in the center of the N-terminal domain (amino acids 310-629) and was previously shown to mediate replication independent association with heterochromatin at chromocenters. Further mutational analyses suggested that the dimeric complex has a bipartite interaction interface and is formed in a head-to-head orientation. Dnmt1 dimer formation could facilitate the discrimination of hemi-methylated target sites as has been found for other palindromic DNA sequence recognizing enzymes. These results assign an additional function to the TS domain and raise the interesting question how these functions are spatially and temporarily co-ordinated.
BACKGROUND: Among men with high-risk non-metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC), we used network meta-analysis to compare non-steroidal anti-androgens (NSAAs) and stratified class-level meta-analysis to identify subgroups with particular benefit from NSAAs with androgen deprivation therapy versus androgen deprivation therapy alone.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a systematic review of phase III parallel-group randomized controlled trials in adult men with nmCRPC. Primary outcome was metastasis-free survival (MFS). Secondary outcomes included overall survival (OS), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression-free survival (PFS), and rates of grade 3 to 4 adverse events (AEs). We assessed class-level effects using random effects models; effect modification owing to subgroup effects using random-effects models to pool study-level differences; and comparative outcomes between agents using fixed-effect network models in a Bayesian framework.RESULTS: Three randomized controlled trials were identified. Pooled MFS, PSA-PFS, and OS were significantly greater with NSAA versus placebo (hazard ratio [HR], 0.32; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.25-0.41; HR, 0.08; 95% CI, 0.05-0.13; and HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.61-0.90, respectively). Subgroup analysis demonstrated a greater benefit with NSAAs in men with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 (HR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.24-0.38) versus 1 (HR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.36-0.56; P = .005), but no difference owing to PSA doubling time (P = .43) or use of osteoclast targeting therapy (P = .77). Bayesian analysis showed apalutamide and enzalutamide had a 56% and 44% likelihood of maximizing MFS, respectively, with subgroup analysis demonstrating these agents were preferred regardless of PSA doubling time and performance status. There was a 44%, 41%, and 15% likelihood that apalutamide, darolutamide and enzalutamide offered the greatest OS benefit, respectively. Grade 3 to 4 AEs were more common with NSAAs (odds ratio [OR], 1.47; 95% CI, 1.27-1.71) and there was a 61% chance that darolutamide was preferred.CONCLUSIONS: NSAAs improve survival in high-risk nmCRPC. Apalutamide and enzalutamide may result in improved oncologic outcomes. Darolutamide may result in fewer AEs. Phase IV data are needed to validate these findings.
During a 10-year period 65 children and adolescents with ambiguous genitalia from the Dominican Republic, not known through kindred studies of 5 alpha-reductase deficiency, were evaluated. Plasma androgen determinations were performed before and/or after Leydig cell stimulation of the testes with human chorionic gonadotropin. Of the children there were 24 female pseudohermaphrodites, 21 of whom had 21-hydroxylase deficiency, 1 true hermaphrodite and 40 (62 per cent) male pseudohermaphrodites. One child had a human chorionic gonadotropin response suggestive of 17-20 desmolase deficiency, and on further evaluation he also had partial deficiencies of the enzymes 21-hydroxylase and 17 alpha-hydroxylase. Five subjects had a female phenotype and subnormal androgen responses to human chorionic gonadotropin. In 5 of 33 male pseudohermaphrodites with a normal testosterone response to human chorionic gonadotropin 5 alpha-reductase deficiency was suspected by elevated plasma testosterone/dihydrotestosterone ratios before and/or after human chorionic gonadotropin stimulation. The diagnosis of 5 alpha-reductase deficiency was confirmed by elevated 5 beta/5 alpha urinary C19 and C21 steroid metabolite ratios. One subject with 5 alpha-reductase deficiency was traced to the original Dominican kindred of 38 affected subjects. Pedigree analysis of another proband revealed 3 additional affected relatives. Four subjects with a normal testosterone response to human chorionic gonadotropin had XO/XY gonadal dysgenesis. There were 25 male pseudohermaphrodites with normal plasma testosterone and dihydrotestosterone responses to human chorionic gonadotropin, who were not diagnosed by this methodology. This study reveals that 5 alpha-reductase deficiency occurs with a frequency of 13 per cent as a cause of male pseudohermaphroditism in the Dominican Republic with approximately the same frequency as XO/XY gonadal dysgenesis. Unlike female pseudohermaphrodites, the majority of male subjects with pseudohermaphroditism remain unclassified by these techniques.
The distribution of cardiolipin across the inner mitochondrial membrane was directly determined by using the ability of the fluorescent dye 10-N-nonyl-3,6-bis(dimethylamino)acridine (10-N-nonyl acridine orange) to form dimers when it interacts with the diacidic phospholipid. Two independent methods were employed: (a) a spectrophotometric measurement of 10-N-nonyl acridine orange binding to isolated rat liver mitochondria, mitoplasts and inside-out submitochondrial particles, and (b) a flow-cytometric analysis of specific red fluorescence, emitted when two dye molecules are bound to one membrane cardiolipin; the stoichiometry of 10-N-nonyl acridine orange binding to phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylinositol, 1 mol dye/mol phospholipid, prevented dye dimerisation and subsequent red-fluorescence appearance. 57% total cardiolipin was present in the outer leaflets of inner membranes of isolated organelles, a distribution confirmed by saturation measurements for mitoplasts and inside-out submitochondrial particles. The same asymmetry was directly observed in situ with mitochondrial membranes of quiescent L1210 cells, and with mitochondrial membranes of respiring yeasts. Nevertheless, alterations in ATP synthesis and inhibition of mitochondrial protein synthesis revealed that cardiolipin distribution was apparently tightly correlated with mitochondrial membrane assembly and activity.
Tacrine is an acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor used as a cognitive enhancer in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, its low therapeutic efficiency and a high incidence of side effects have limited its clinical use. In this study, the molecular mechanisms underlying the impact on brain activity of tacrine and two novel tacrine analogues (T1, T2) were approached by focusing on three aspects: (i) their effects on brain cholinesterase activity; (ii) perturbations on electron transport chain enzymes activities of non-synaptic brain mitochondria; and (iii) the role of mitochondrial lipidome changes induced by these compounds on mitochondrial bioenergetics. Brain effects were evaluated 18 h after the administration of a single dose (75.6 μmol/kg) of tacrine or tacrine analogues. The three compounds promoted a significant reduction in brain AChE and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) activities. Additionally, tacrine was shown to be more efficient in brain AChE inhibition than T2 tacrine analogue and less active than T1 tacrine analogue, whereas BuChE inhibition followed the order: T1 > T2 > tacrine. The studies using non-synaptic brain mitochondria show that all the compounds studied disturbed brain mitochondrial bioenergetics mainly via the inhibition of complex I activity. Furthermore, the activity of complex IV is also affected by tacrine and T1 treatments while FoF(1) -ATPase is only affected by tacrine. Therefore, the compounds' toxicity as regards brain mitochondria, which follows the order: tacrine >> T1 > T2, does not correlate with their ability to inhibit brain cholinesterase enzymes. Lipidomics approaches show that phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) is the most abundant phospholipids (PL) class in non-synaptic brain mitochondria and cardiolipin (CL) present the greatest diversity of molecular species. Tacrine induced significant perturbations in the mitochondrial PL profile, which were detected by means of changes in the relative abundance of phosphatidylcholine (PC), PE, phosphatidylinositol (PI) and CL and by the presence of oxidized phosphatidylserines. Additionally, in both the T1 and T2 groups, the lipid content and molecular composition of brain mitochondria PL are perturbed to a lesser extent than in the tacrine group. Abnormalities in CL content and the amount of oxidized phosphatidylserines were associated with significant reductions in mitochondrial enzymes activities, mainly complex I. These results indicate that tacrine and its analogues impair mitochondrial function and bioenergetics, thus compromising the activity of brain cells.
CASE REPORT: A 55 year old woman presented with retinal vasculitis, multiple aneurysms, macular exudation and widespread retinal nonperfusion and was diagnosed with IRVAN. She was treated with panretinal laser photocoagulation. After 3 years of follow up visual acuity remains stable and there are no complications due to ischaemic sequelae.DISCUSSION: IRVAN syndrome with neovascularisation can progress rapidly despite laser treatment. Panretinal laser photocoagulation has to be considered in the early stages as it is effective in stopping the progression of ischaemia.
INTRODUCTION: Surgical excision of deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE) is complex and associated with morbidity. Diagnostic imaging plays an important role in the preoperative workup. We sought to determine the utility of single sagittal T2-weighted MRI motion sequence in the preoperative assessment of pelvic mobility in patients with endometriosis.METHODS: An observational study at a single tertiary public referral centre in Australia. Eighty-one MRI studies from 1 May 2019 to 3 December 2019, were enrolled. Studies were included if they were performed to stage endometriosis, including a T2-weighted motion series, adequately covering a uterus, cervix and rectum. Fifty-seven studies met inclusion criteria. The reference standard was a contemporaneous transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) reporting on pelvic organ mobility. Three subspecialist radiologists were then blindly asked to identify, on the cine loop: rectouterine immobility, superficial endometriosis (pelvic bowel adhesions), rectosigmoid Deep Infiltrating Endometriosis (DIE). Fleiss' Kappa assessed interobserver agreement. Consensus MRI sensitivity and specificity were estimated against the reference standard (TVUS).RESULTS: Median age was 35 years (range 19-51). Forty-three cases had a contemporaneous TVUS; 14 reporting a sliding sign, 29 with fixed pelves. Interobserver agreement was 'substantial' (k = 0.79) for absent MRI sliding sign and 'almost perfect' (k = 0.90) for absence of DIE. Consensus MRI had 90% sensitivity (95% CI 73-98%) for pelvic immobility at TVUS (absent sliding sign). Interobserver agreement and consensus MRI sensitivity were higher for adhesions and immobility than normal findings.CONCLUSION: An MRI motion sequence can identify patients with pelvic adhesions and immobility, helping determine surgical difficulty when TVUS is not diagnostic.
Classic osteogenesis imperfecta, an autosomal dominant disorder associated with osteoporosis and bone fragility, is caused by mutations in the genes for type I collagen. A recessive form of the disorder has long been suspected. Since the loss of cartilage-associated protein (CRTAP), which is required for post-translational prolyl 3-hydroxylation of collagen, causes severe osteoporosis in mice, we investigated whether CRTAP deficiency is associated with recessive osteogenesis imperfecta. Three of 10 children with lethal or severe osteogenesis imperfecta, who did not have a primary collagen defect yet had excess post-translational modification of collagen, were found to have a recessive condition resulting in CRTAP deficiency, suggesting that prolyl 3-hydroxylation of type I collagen is important for bone formation.
Side-effects are commonly manifested during intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) immunotherapy of superficial bladder cancer. This often causes delays or interruptions of the instillations and consequently reduces the efficacy of treatment. Treatment strategies aimed at reducing the side-effects of BCG immunotherapy while maintaining efficacy are currently being considered in the search for an optimal treatment regimen. The following two approaches to BCG immunotherapy were investigated at the Department of Urology of Padova University by specific Phase II and III trials designed to evaluate the possibility of reducing BCG-related side-effects without compromising therapeutic efficacy: (1) by reducing the dose of BCG per instillation 'low-dose' regimen, (2) by delaying the interval of the instillations 'slow-rate' regimen.
POEMS syndrome, a rare multisystem disease, is a variant of osteosclerotic myeloma and is characterized by polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal proteins, and skin changes. Presented herein is a case of POEMS syndrome with flushing. The flushing was intermittent, involving the face and upper third of the trunk, and was associated with hypotension and bronchospasm. Final diagnosis was made by biopsy examination of an axillary lymph node, which showed angiofollicular hyperplasia that stained strongly and selectively for lambda light chains. The patient had most of the typical features of POEMS syndrome but was unique in that her most striking finding was carcinoid-like flushing. The flushing improved with steroid therapy, as did some of the other clinical features of her disease. This case suggests that idiopathic flushing can be added to the skin changes observed in POEMS syndrome.
PURPOSE OF REVIEW: We give an update on the etiology and potential treatment options of rare inherited monogenic disorders associated with arterial calcification and calcific cardiac valve disease.RECENT FINDINGS: Genetic studies of rare inherited syndromes have identified key regulators of ectopic calcification. Based on the pathogenic principles causing the diseases, these can be classified into three groups: (1) disorders of an increased extracellular inorganic phosphate/inorganic pyrophosphate ratio (generalized arterial calcification of infancy, pseudoxanthoma elasticum, arterial calcification and distal joint calcification, progeria, idiopathic basal ganglia calcification, and hyperphosphatemic familial tumoral calcinosis; (2) interferonopathies (Singleton-Merten syndrome); and (3) others, including Keutel syndrome and Gaucher disease type IIIC. Although some of the identified causative mechanisms are not easy to target for treatment, it has become clear that a disturbed serum phosphate/pyrophosphate ratio is a major force triggering arterial and cardiac valve calcification. Further studies will focus on targeting the phosphate/pyrophosphate ratio to effectively prevent and treat these calcific disease phenotypes.
A mechanism for the formation of lamellar systems in the plant cell has been proposed as a result of electron microscope observations of young and mature cells of Nitella cristata and the plastids of Zea mays in normal plants, developing plants, and certain mutant types. The results are compatible with the concept that lamellar structures arise by the fusion or coalescence of small vesicular elements, giving rise initially to closed double membrane Structures (cisternae). In the chloroplasts of Zea, the cisternae subsequently undergo structural transformations to give rise to a compound layer structure already described for the individual chloroplast lamellae. During normal development, the minute vesicles in the young chloroplast are aggregated into one or more dense granular bodies (prolamellar bodies) which often appear crystalline. Lamellae grow out from these bodies. In fully etiolated leaves lamellae are absent and the prolamellar bodies become quite large, presumably because of inhibition of the fusion step which appears to require chlorophyll. Lamellae develop rapidly on exposure of the plant to light, and subsequent development closely parallels that seen under normal conditions. The plastids of white and very pale green mutants of Zea similarly lack lamellae and contain only vesicular elements. A specialized peripheral zone immediately below the double limiting membrane in Zea chloroplasts appears to be responsible for the production of vesicles. These may be immediately converted to lamellae under normal conditions, but accumulate to form a prolamellar body if lamellar formation is prevented, as in the case of etiolation and chlorophyll-deficient mutation, or when the rate of lamellar formation is slower than that of the production of precursor material (as appears to be the case in the early stages of normal development).
BACKGROUND: Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) dual infection (DI) has been associated with decreased CD4 T-cell counts and increased viral loads; however, the frequency of intrasubtype DI is poorly understood. We used ultradeep sequencing (UDS) to estimate the frequency of DI in a primary infection cohort of predominantly men who have sex with men (MSM).METHODS:  HIV-1 genomes from longitudinal blood samples of recently infected, therapy-naive participants were interrogated with UDS. DI was confirmed when maximum sequence divergence was excessive and supported by phylogenetic analysis. Coinfection was defined as DI at baseline; superinfection was monoinfection at baseline and DI at a later time point.RESULTS:  Of 118 participants, 7 were coinfected and 10 acquired superinfection. Superinfection incidence rate was 4.96 per 100 person-years (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.67-9.22); 6 occurred in the first year and 4 in the second. Overall cumulative prevalence of intrasubtype B DI was 14.4% (95% CI, 8.6%-22.1%). Primary HIV-1 incidence was 4.37 per 100 person-years (95% CI, 3.56-5.36).CONCLUSIONS:  Intrasubtype DI was frequent and comparable to primary infection rates among MSM in San Diego; however, superinfection rates declined over time. DI is likely an important component of the HIV epidemic dynamics, and development of stronger immune responses to the initial infection may protect from superinfection.
Aberrant accumulation and activation of eosinophils and potentially mast cells (MCs) contribute to the pathogenesis of eosinophilic gastrointestinal diseases (EGIDs), including eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), gastritis (EG), and gastroenteritis (EGE). Current treatment options, such as diet restriction and corticosteroids, have limited efficacy and are often inappropriate for chronic use. One promising new approach is to deplete eosinophils and inhibit MCs with a monoclonal antibody (mAb) against sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin 8 (Siglec-8), an inhibitory receptor selectively expressed on MCs and eosinophils. Here, we characterize MCs and eosinophils from human EG and EoE biopsies using flow cytometry and evaluate the effects of an anti-Siglec-8 mAb using a potentially novel Siglec-8-transgenic mouse model in which EG/EGE was induced by ovalbumin sensitization and intragastric challenge. MCs and eosinophils were significantly increased and activated in human EG and EoE biopsies compared with healthy controls. Similar observations were made in EG/EGE mice. In Siglec-8-transgenic mice, anti-Siglec-8 mAb administration significantly reduced eosinophils and MCs in the stomach, small intestine, and mesenteric lymph nodes and decreased levels of inflammatory mediators. In summary, these findings suggest a role for both MCs and eosinophils in EGID pathogenesis and support the evaluation of anti-Siglec-8 as a therapeutic approach that targets both eosinophils and MCs.
BACKGROUND: Data extraction and integration methods are becoming essential to effectively access and take advantage of the huge amounts of heterogeneous genomics and clinical data increasingly available. In this work, we focus on The Cancer Genome Atlas, a comprehensive archive of tumoral data containing the results of high-throughout experiments, mainly Next Generation Sequencing, for more than 30 cancer types.RESULTS: We propose TCGA2BED a software tool to search and retrieve TCGA data, and convert them in the structured BED format for their seamless use and integration. Additionally, it supports the conversion in CSV, GTF, JSON, and XML standard formats. Furthermore, TCGA2BED extends TCGA data with information extracted from other genomic databases (i.e., NCBI Entrez Gene, HGNC, UCSC, and miRBase). We also provide and maintain an automatically updated data repository with publicly available Copy Number Variation, DNA-methylation, DNA-seq, miRNA-seq, and RNA-seq (V1,V2) experimental data of TCGA converted into the BED format, and their associated clinical and biospecimen meta data in attribute-value text format.CONCLUSIONS: The availability of the valuable TCGA data in BED format reduces the time spent in taking advantage of them: it is possible to efficiently and effectively deal with huge amounts of cancer genomic data integratively, and to search, retrieve and extend them with additional information. The BED format facilitates the investigators allowing several knowledge discovery analyses on all tumor types in TCGA with the final aim of understanding pathological mechanisms and aiding cancer treatments.
The DNA replication (or origin) licensing system ensures precise duplication of the genome in each cell cycle and is a powerful regulator of cell proliferation in metazoa. Studies in yeast, Drosophila melanogaster and Xenopus laevis have characterised the molecular machinery that constitutes the licensing system, but it remains to be determined how this important evolutionary conserved pathway is regulated in Homo sapiens. We have investigated regulation of the origin licensing factors Cdc6, Cdt1, Mcm2 and Geminin in human somatic and germ cells. Cdc6 and Cdt1 play an essential role in DNA replication initiation by loading the Mcm2-7 complex, which is required for unwinding the DNA helix, onto chromosomal origins. Geminin is a repressor of origin licensing that blocks Mcm2-7 loading onto origins. Our studies demonstrate that Cdc6, Cdt1 and Mcm2 play a central role in coordinating growth during the proliferation-differentiation switch in somatic self-renewing systems and that Cdc6 expression is rate-limiting for acquisition of replication competence in primary oocytes. In striking contrast, we show that proliferation control during male gametogenesis is not linked to Cdc6 or Mcm2, but appears to be coordinated by the negative regulator Geminin with Cdt1 becoming rate-limiting in late prophase. Our data demonstrate a striking sexual dimorphism in the mechanisms repressing origin licensing and preventing untimely DNA synthesis during meiosis I, implicating a pivotal role for Geminin in maintaining integrity of the male germline genome.
Ty3/gypsy elements represent one of the most abundant and diverse LTR-retrotransposon (LTRr) groups in the Anopheles gambiae genome, but their evolutionary dynamics have not been explored in detail. Here, we conduct an in silico analysis of the distribution and abundance of the full complement of 1045 copies in the updated AgamP3 assembly. Chromosomal distribution of Ty3/gypsy elements is inversely related to arm length, with densities being greatest on the X, and greater on the short versus long arms of both autosomes. Taking into account the different heterochromatic and euchromatic compartments of the genome, our data suggest that the relative abundance of Ty3/gypsy LTRrs along each chromosome arm is determined mainly by the different proportions of heterochromatin, particularly pericentric heterochromatin, relative to total arm length. Additionally, the breakpoint regions of chromosomal inversion 2La appears to be a haven for LTRrs. These elements are underrepresented more than 7-fold in euchromatin, where 33% of the Ty3/gypsy copies are associated with genes. The euchromatin on chromosome 3R shows a faster turnover rate of Ty3/gypsy elements, characterized by a deficit of proviral sequences and the lowest average sequence divergence of any autosomal region analyzed in this study. This probably reflects a principal role of purifying selection against insertion for the preservation of longer conserved syntenyc blocks with adaptive importance located in 3R. Although some Ty3/gypsy LTRrs show evidence of recent activity, an important fraction are inactive remnants of relatively ancient insertions apparently subject to genetic drift. Consistent with these computational predictions, an analysis of the occupancy rate of putatively older insertions in natural populations suggested that the degenerate copies have been fixed across the species range in this mosquito, and also are shared with the sibling species Anopheles arabiensis.
OBJECTIVE: We report the cases of 2 patients with late-onset spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) type III, who were hemizygous for SMN1 deletion and carriers of novel SMN1 intragenic missense mutations, and we investigate the genotype-phenotype relationship.METHODS: Patients were tested for SMN1 deletions with standard methodology. Sequencing of all exons, exon-intron junctions, and flanking sequences of SMN1 by nested PCR was used to detect intragenic point mutations. SMN1 and SMN2 quantification was undertaken to investigate the genotype-phenotype relationship.RESULTS: Two novel point mutations were identified in exon 3 of SMN1 (p.Tyr130Cys and p.Tyr130His) in the highly conserved Tudor domain of the Smn protein.CONCLUSIONS: The genetic basis of SMA in the rare cases of compound heterozygous carriers of SMN1 deletions is complex. Small intragenic SMN1 mutations often lead to severe SMA phenotypes, especially if the point mutations lie in exon 3 that codes for the highly conserved Tudor domain of the Smn protein. Although both our patients were carriers of intragenic SMN1 mutations in the coding region of the Tudor domain, they presented with a mild SMA phenotype despite a low SMN2 copy number. We discuss the possible determinant role of these novel missense mutations in the phenotypic outcome and compensatory mechanisms that may account for the genotype-phenotype discrepancy.
Human piebaldism is a rare autosomal dominant disorder that comprises congenital patchy depigmentation of the scalp, forehead, trunk and limbs. It is caused by mutations in the cell-surface receptor tyrosine kinase gene (KIT, also c-kit). We screened three families and three isolated cases of piebaldism from different countries for mutations in the KIT gene using automated sequencing methods. We report six novel KIT point mutations: three missense (C788R, W835R, P869S) at highly conserved amino acid sites; one nonsense (Q347X) that results in termination of translation of the KIT gene in exon 6; and two splice site nucleotide substitutions (IVS13+2T>G, IVS17-1G>A) that are predicted to impair normal splicing. These mutations were not detected in over 100 normal individuals and are likely to be the cause of piebaldism in our subjects.
The study of epigenetic properties of the human genome, including structural modifications of DNA and chromatin, has increased tremendously as mounting evidence has demonstrated how much epigenetics affects human gene expression. Buenrostro et al. have developed a rapid method, requiring low numbers of living cells as input, for examining chromatin accessibility across the epigenome, known as the assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq). The overall goal of this unit is to provide a thorough ATAC-seq data analysis plan, as well as describe how primary human blood samples can be processed for use in ATAC-seq. In addition, a number of quality control parameters are discussed to ensure the integrity and confidence in the ATAC-seq data. © 2017 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
The reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 [t(9;22)(q34;q11), Philadelphia chromosome] creates a BCR-ABL1 fusion protein that occurs in approximately 95% of cases of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), 15% of cases of adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and 5% of adult cases of acute myeloid leukemia. The BCR-ABL1 protein is a constitutively activated tyrosine kinase that induces and maintains the neoplastic phenotype in these leukemias. PCR-based methods to identify and quantitate the tumor-specific BCR-ABL1 RNA have been shown to be an ultrasensitive diagnostic, prognostic, and monitoring tool for Philadelphia-positive leukemias. A novel tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), imatinib, has been confirmed as an effective targeted treatment in most CML patients. However, a significant minority of patients being treated with imatinib develop resistance to the drug as evidenced by rising BCR-ABL1 levels. The most common mechanism of resistance in these patients is the development of mutations in the BCR-ABL1 kinase domain (KD) that abrogate binding of imatinib. Although KD mutations are quite heterogeneous, the identification of the exact mutation site is clinically important, as some mutations, but not others, can be effectively treated with second-generation TKIs. One mutation, T315I, for example, renders the leukemia resistant to all first- and second-line TKIs. Thus, DNA sequencing of the BCR-ABL1 kinase domain in resistant patients helps identify those who may benefit from a change in TKI agents, or those who should be considered for other therapeutic measures, such as stem cell transplantation. We describe here a method for sequencing the BCR-ABL1 kinase domain in peripheral blood or bone marrow of CML patients.
OBJECT: Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 2 and 9 are important for tissue breakdown in the process of tumor invasion. The aim of this study is to evaluate the relationship between the expression of MMP-2, MMP-9, MIB-1 LI and cavernous sinus invasion in pituitary adenomas.METHODS: Tissue samples from 54 patients with pituitary adenomas were studied. Expression of MMP-2, MMP-9, and MIB-1 labeling index (LI) were evaluated by immunohistochemical method. In sixteen cases, the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 mRNA was also examined by RT-PCR assay.RESULTS: Thirty-four patients were women and 20 were men, with a mean age of 49.9 years old (range 18-76 years). There were 12 cases with cavernous sinus invasion, and 42 were noninvasive cases. MMP-2 and MMP-9 score of invasive case (3.9 +/- 0.5,4.1 +/- 0.4) were significantly higher than those (2.3 +/- 0.2; p < 0.01; 2.6 +/- 0.2; p < 0.01) without invasion. The MIB-1 LI of this study presented no significantly difference between the invasive and noninvasive pituitary adenomas. The percentage of MMP-2 mRNA/beta-actin mRNA and MMP-9 mRNA/beta-actin mRNA were also observed significantly higher in invasive pituitary adenomas (68.2 +/- 15.3%; 59.7 +/- 12.5%) than noninvasive pituitary adenomas (21.8 +/- 8.2%, p < 0.05; 33.3 +/- 5.4%, p < 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 may have a value to assess the invasive pituitary adenomas, and proliferation and invasion of pituitary adenomas may present a different mechanism.
Linear ubiquitin chains generated by the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC) play an important role in NF-κB activation. However, the regulation of linear ubiquitin chain generation by LUBAC is not well characterized. Here, we identified two deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), ovarian tumor DUB with linear linkage specificity (OTULIN/Gumby/FAM105B) and cylindromatosis (CYLD) that can cleave linear polyubiquitin chains and interact with LUBAC via the N-terminal PNGase/UBA or UBX (PUB) domain of HOIP, a catalytic subunit of LUBAC. HOIP interacts with both CYLD and OTULIN even in unstimulated cells. The interaction of CYLD and OTULIN with HOIP synergistically suppresses LUBAC-mediated linear polyubiquitination and NF-κB activation. Moreover, introduction of a HOIP mutant unable to bind either deubiquitinase into HOIP-null cells augments the activation of NF-κB by TNF-α stimulation. Thus, the interactions between these two deubiquitinases and the LUBAC ubiquitin ligase are involved in controlling the extent of TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation in cells by fine-tuning the generation of linear ubiquitin chains by LUBAC. The interaction of HOIP with OTULIN is also involved in OTULIN suppressing the canonical Wnt signaling pathway activation by LUBAC. Our observations provide molecular insights into the roles of ligase-deubiquitinase interactions in regulating molecular events resulting from linear ubiquitin conjugation.
Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by loss of spinal motor neurons. The gene encoding the survival of motor neurons (SMN) protein is mutated in >95% of SMA cases. SMN is the central component of a large oligomeric complex, including Gemins2-7, that is necessary and sufficient for the in vivo assembly of Sm proteins onto the small nuclear (sn)RNAs that mediate pre-mRNA splicing. After cytoplasmic assembly of the Sm core, both SMN and splicing snRNPs are imported into the nucleus, accumulating in Cajal bodies for additional snRNA maturation steps before targeting to splicing factor compartments known as "speckles." In this study, we analyzed the function of individual SMN complex members by RNA interference (RNAi). RNAi-mediated knockdown of SMN, Gemin2, Gemin3, and Gemin4 each disrupted Sm core assembly, whereas knockdown of Gemin5 and Snurportin1 had no effect. Assembly activity was rescued by expression of a GFP-SMN construct that is refractive to RNAi but not by similar constructs that contain SMA patient-derived mutations. Our results also demonstrate that Cajal body homeostasis requires SMN and ongoing snRNP biogenesis. Perturbation of SMN function results in disassembly of Cajal bodies and relocalization of the marker protein, coilin, to nucleoli. Moreover, in SMN-deficient cells, newly synthesized SmB proteins fail to associate with U2 snRNA or accumulate in Cajal bodies. Collectively, our results identify a previously uncharacterized function for Gemin3 and Gemin4 in Sm core assembly and correlate the activity of this pathway with SMA.
This issue of Seminars in Medical Genetics, American Journal of Medical Genetics Part C investigates the human diseases caused by mutations in the BAF complex (also known as the mammalian SWI/SNF complex) genes, particularly focusing on Coffin-Siris syndrome (CSS). CSS is a rare congenital malformation syndrome characterized by developmental delay or intellectual disability (ID), coarse facial appearance, feeding difficulties, frequent infections, and hypoplasia/aplasia of the fifth fingernails and fifth distal phalanges. In 2012, 42 years after the first description of CSS in 1970, five causative genes (SMARCB1, SMARCE1, SMARCA4, ARID1A, ARID1B), all encoding components of the BAF complex, were identified as being responsible for CSS through whole exome sequencing and pathway-based genetic screening. The identification of two additional causative genes (PHF6, SOX11) followed. Mutations in another BAF complex gene (SMARCA2) and (TBC1D24) were found to cause clinically similar conditions with ID, Nicolaides-Baraitser syndrome and DOORS syndrome, respectively. Also, ADNP was found to be mutated in an autism/ID syndrome. Furthermore, there is growing evidences for germline or somatic mutations in the BAF complex genes to be causal for cancer/cancer predisposition syndromes. These discoveries have highlighted the role of the BAF complex in the human development and cancer formation. The biology of BAF is very complicated and much remains unknown. Ongoing research is required to reveal the whole picture of the BAF complex in human development, and will lead to the development of new targeted therapies for related disorders in the future.
BACKGROUND: The nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway promotes the rapid degradation of mRNAs containing premature termination codons (PTCs). In yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the activity of the NMD pathway depends on the recognition of the PTC by the translational machinery. Translation termination factors eRF1 (Sup45) and eRF3 (Sup35) participate not only in the last step of protein synthesis but also in mRNA degradation and translation initiation via interaction with such proteins as Pab1, Upf1, Upf2 and Upf3.RESULTS: In this work we have used previously isolated sup45 mutants of S. cerevisiae to characterize degradation of aberrant mRNA in conditions when translation termination is impaired. We have sequenced his7-1, lys9-A21 and trp1-289 alleles which are frequently used for analysis of nonsense suppression. We have established that sup45 nonsense and missense mutations lead to accumulation of his7-1 mRNA and CYH2 pre-mRNA. Remarkably, deletion of the UPF1 gene suppresses some sup45 phenotypes. In particular, sup45-n upf1Delta double mutants were less temperature sensitive, and more resistant to paromomycin than sup45 single mutants. In addition, deletion of either UPF2 or UPF3 restored viability of sup45-n double mutants.CONCLUSION: This is the first demonstration that sup45 mutations do not only change translation fidelity but also acts by causing a change in mRNA stability.
OBJECT: The objective of this study was to report the authors' experience with the long-term administration of temozolomide (TMZ; > 6 cycles, up to 101) in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma and to analyze its feasibility and safety as well as its impact on survival. The authors also compared data obtained from the group of patients undergoing long-term TMZ treatment with data from patients treated with a standard TMZ protocol.METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted of 37 patients who underwent operations for glioblastoma between 2004 and 2012. Volumetric analysis of postoperative Gd-enhanced MR images, obtained within 48 hours, confirmed tumor gross-total resection (GTR) in all but 2 patients. All patients received the first cycle of TMZ at a dosage of 150 mg/m(2) starting on the second or third postsurgical day. Afterward, patients received concomitant radiochemotherapy according to the Stupp protocol. With regard to adjuvant TMZ therapy, the 19 patients in Group A, aged 30-72 years (mean 56.1 years), received 150 mg/m(2) for 5 days every 28 days for more than 6 cycles (range 7-101 cycles). The 18 patients in Group B, aged 46-82 years (mean 64.8 years), received the same dose, but for no more than 6 cycles. O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation status was analyzed for both groups and correlated with overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). The impact of age, sex, Karnofsky Performance Scale score, and Ki 67 staining were also considered.RESULTS: All patients but 1 in Group A survived at least 18 months (range 18-101 months), and patients in Group B survived no more than 17 months (range 2-17 months). The long-term survivors (Group A), defined as patients who survived at least 12 months after diagnosis, were 51.3% of the total (19/37). Kaplan-Meier curve analysis showed that patients treated with more than 6 TMZ cycles had OS and PFS that was significantly longer than patients receiving standard treatment (median OS 28 months vs 8 months, respectively; p = 0.0001; median PFS 20 months vs 4 months, respectively; p = 0.0002). By univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis, MGMT methylation status and number of TMZ cycles appeared to be survival prognostic factors in patients with glioblastoma. After controlling for MGMT status, highly significant differences related to OS and PFS between patients with standard and long-term TMZ treatment were still detected. Furthermore, in Group A and B, the statistical correlation of MGMT status to the number of TMZ cycles showed a significant difference only in Group A patients, suggesting that MGMT promoter methylation was predictive of response for long-term TMZ treatment. Prolonged therapy did not confer hematological toxicity or opportunistic infections in either patient group.CONCLUSIONS: This study describes the longest experience so far reported with TMZ in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastomas, with as many as 101 cycles, who were treated using GTR. Statistically significant data confirm that median survival correlates with MGMT promoter methylation status as well as with the number of TMZ cycles administered. Long-term TMZ therapy appears feasible and safe.
OBJECTIVE: The role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of acute ischemic stroke is well known, but its association with the clinical picture is as yet unclear.MATERIAL AND METHODS: In our study, we measured the serum levels of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) within the first 50 h of stroke in 60 acute stroke patients, and examined the association with the natural anticoagulants protein C and free protein S. We compared the results with a control group that consisted of 30 volunteers. We also correlated their levels with the clinical outcomes by using the Canadian Neurological Scale (CNS).RESULTS: Neither stroke patients nor the control group had any elevations in IL-1beta serum levels. However, the levels of serum IL-6 were significantly higher in stroke patients (13.7 +/- 19.46 vs. 4.3 +/- 15.88, p = 0.002). In addition, the protein S levels of patients were lower than those of the controls (84.36 +/- 27.97 vs. 95.9 +/- 25.64, p = 0.007). Although IL-6 showed negative correlation with protein S (r = -0.504, p = 0.000), the other studied cytokines TNFalpha and IL-1beta did not correlate with these natural anticoagulants. Another negative correlation was found between IL-6 and CNS scores (r = -0.451, p = 0.000). In addition, both protein C and protein S positively correlated with CNS (r = 0.263, p = 0.042; r = 0.381, p = 0.003). There was also a positive correlation between protein C and protein S (r = 0.408, p = 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that TNFalpha and IL1beta serum levels are not elevated in the acute phase of stroke and have no correlation with the natural anticoagulants protein C and protein S. However, a decrease in free protein S may be related to elevated IL-6 levels. In addition, increased levels of IL-6 and reduced levels of protein C and protein S may play a role in acute ischemic stroke severity.
Nine patients (7 with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, 1 with progressive spinal amyotrophy and 1 with chronic anterior poliomyelitis) were treated by sequential intravenous administration of 240 mg of TRH over one hour every two weeks. Results were assessed by an analytical evaluation of muscle strength before and 24 h after each infusion and by objective and subjective evaluation of spasticity. Significant improvement, as shown by statistical analysis, was noted in muscle strength in the 9 patients by 5 infusions over a 4-week period and a sub-group of 5 patients treated by 8 infusions over 10 weeks. Continued use of this therapy is justified by the need to determine its long-term effects and the psychological improvement noted in some patients after an even transient improvement in motor performance. However this treatment is obviously not curative.

Circadian clocks coordinate behavioral and physiological processes with daily light-dark cycles by driving rhythmic transcription of thousands of genes. Whereas the master clock in the brain is set by light, pacemakers in peripheral organs, such as the liver, are reset by food availability, although the setting, or "entrainment," mechanisms remain mysterious. Studying mouse fibroblasts, we demonstrated that the nutrient-responsive adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylates and destabilizes the clock component cryptochrome 1 (CRY1). In mouse livers, AMPK activity and nuclear localization were rhythmic and inversely correlated with CRY1 nuclear protein abundance. Stimulation of AMPK destabilized cryptochromes and altered circadian rhythms, and mice in which the AMPK pathway was genetically disrupted showed alterations in peripheral clocks. Thus, phosphorylation by AMPK enables cryptochrome to transduce nutrient signals to circadian clocks in mammalian peripheral organs.
To study isoform-specific effects of apolipoprotein E (apoE) in vivo, we generated mice with a human APOE*2 allele in place of the mouse Apoe gene via targeted gene replacement in embryonic stem cells. Mice expressing human apoE2 (2/2) have virtually all the characteristics of type III hyperlipoproteinemia. Their plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels are both twice to three times those in (normolipidemic) mice that are expressing human apoE3 (3/3) made in an identical manner. The 2/2 mice are markedly defective in clearing beta-migrating VLDL particles, and spontaneously develop atherosclerotic plaques, even on a regular diet. An atherogenic diet, high in fat and cholesterol, exacerbates development of atherosclerosis and xanthomas in the 2/2 mice. Thus, comparisons between the 2/2 and 3/3 mice unequivocally demonstrate that a single amino acid difference (Arg158 Cys) in the apoE protein is sufficient to cause type III HLP and spontaneous atherosclerosis in mice.
The Drosophila compound eye is specified by the simultaneous and interdependent activity of transcriptional regulatory genes from four families: PAX6 (eyeless, twin of eyeless, eyegone), EYA (eyes absent), SIX (sine oculis, Optix) and DACH (dachshund). Mammals have homologues of all these genes, and many of them are expressed in the embryonic or adult eye, but the functional relationships between them are currently much less clear than in Drosophila. Nevertheless, mutations in the mammalian genes highlight their requirement both within and outside the eye in embryos and adults, and emphasize that they can be deployed in many different contexts.
BACKGROUND & AIMS: Epidemiologic studies have suggested beneficial effects of flavonoids on cardiovascular disease. Cocoa and particularly dark chocolate are rich in flavonoids and recent studies have demonstrated blood pressure lowering effects of dark chocolate. However, limited data are available on the association of chocolate consumption and the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). We sought to examine the association between chocolate consumption and prevalent CHD.METHODS: We studied in a cross-sectional design 4970 participants aged 25-93 years who participated in the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Family Heart Study. Chocolate intake was assessed through a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. We used generalized estimating equations to estimate adjusted odds ratios.RESULTS: Compared to subjects who did not report any chocolate intake, odds ratios (95% CI) for CHD were 1.01 (0.76-1.37), 0.74 (0.56-0.98), and 0.43 (0.28-0.67) for subjects consuming 1-3 times/month, 1-4 times/week, and 5+ times/week, respectively (p for trend <0.0001) adjusting for age, sex, family CHD risk group, energy intake, education, non-chocolate candy intake, linolenic acid intake, smoking, alcohol intake, exercise, and fruit and vegetables. Consumption of non-chocolate candy was associated with a 49% higher prevalence of CHD comparing 5+/week vs. 0/week [OR = 1.49 (0.96-2.32)].CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that consumption of chocolate is inversely related with prevalent CHD in a general United States population.
BACKGROUND: Measles virus (MV) is a member of the Paramyxoviridae family and an important human pathogen causing strong immunosuppression in affected individuals and a considerable number of deaths worldwide. Currently, measles is a re-emerging disease in developed countries. MV is usually quantified in infectious units as determined by limiting dilution and counting of plaque forming unit either directly (PFU method) or indirectly from random distribution in microwells (TCID50 method). Both methods are time-consuming (up to several days), cumbersome and, in the case of the PFU assay, possibly operator dependent.METHODS/FINDINGS: A rapid, optimized, accurate, and reliable technique for titration of measles virus was developed based on the detection of virus infected cells by flow cytometry, single round of infection and titer calculation according to the Poisson's law. The kinetics follow up of the number of infected cells after infection with serial dilutions of a virus allowed estimation of the duration of the replication cycle, and consequently, the optimal infection time. The assay was set up to quantify measles virus, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) using antibody labeling of viral glycoprotein, virus encoded fluorescent reporter protein and an inducible fluorescent-reporter cell line, respectively.CONCLUSION: Overall, performing the assay takes only 24-30 hours for MV strains, 12 hours for VSV, and 52 hours for HIV-1. The step-by-step procedure we have set up can be, in principle, applicable to accurately quantify any virus including lentiviral vectors, provided that a virus encoded gene product can be detected by flow cytometry.
Pyostomatitis vegetans is a rare disease of the oral cavity with characteristic clinical and histopathological findings. Its importance lies in its high correlation with inflammatory diseases of the intestinal tract. The present case report and a review of the literature are taken as a basis to discuss the disease as an entity. Pyostomatitis vegetans is a specific marker for ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.
Dyskeratosis congenita (DC) is a multisystem inherited syndrome exhibiting marked clinical and genetic heterogeneity. In its classic form, it is characterized by mucocutaneous abnormalities, BM failure, and a predisposition to cancer. BM failure is the principal cause of premature mortality. Studies over the last 15 years have led to significant advances, with 8 DC genes (DKC1, TERC, TERT, NOP10, NHP2, TIN2, C16orf57, and TCAB1) having been characterized. Seven of these are important in telomere maintenance either because they encode components of the telomerase enzyme complex (DKC1, TERC, TERT, NOP10, NHP2, and TCAB1) or the shelterin complex (TINF2). DC is therefore principally a disease of defective telomere maintenance and patients usually have very short telomeres. The genetic advances have led to the unification of DC with several other disorders, including the severe multisystem disorders Hoyeraal-Hreidarsson and Revesz syndromes, as well as a subset of patients with aplastic anemia, myelodysplasia, leukemia, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. This wide spectrum of diseases ranging from classic DC to aplastic anemia can be regarded as disorders of defective telomere maintenance-"the telomereopathies." These advances have increased our understanding of normal hematopoiesis and highlighted the important role of telomerase and telomeres in human biology. They are also facilitating the diagnosis (especially when presentation is atypical) and management of DC.
Hyperhomocysteinemia, a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, is caused by nutritional and/or genetic disruptions in homocysteine metabolism. The most common genetic cause of hyperhomocysteinemia is the 677C-->T mutation in the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene. This variant, with mild enzymatic deficiency, is associated with an increased risk for neural tube defects and pregnancy complications and with a decreased risk for colon cancer and leukemia. Although many studies have reported that this variant is also a risk factor for vascular disease, this area of investigation is still controversial. Severe MTHFR deficiency results in homocystinuria, an inborn error of metabolism with neurological and vascular complications. To investigate the in vivo pathogenetic mechanisms of MTHFR deficiency, we generated mice with a knockout of MTHFR: Plasma total homocysteine levels in heterozygous and homozygous knockout mice are 1.6- and 10-fold higher than those in wild-type littermates, respectively. Both heterozygous and homozygous knockouts have either significantly decreased S-adenosylmethionine levels or significantly increased S-adenosylhomocysteine levels, or both, with global DNA hypomethylation. The heterozygous knockout mice appear normal, whereas the homozygotes are smaller and show developmental retardation with cerebellar pathology. Abnormal lipid deposition in the proximal portion of the aorta was observed in older heterozygotes and homozygotes, alluding to an atherogenic effect of hyperhomocysteinemia in these mice.
Intronless genes (IGs) constitute approximately 3% of the human genome. Human IGs are essentially different in evolution and functionality from the IGs of unicellular eukaryotes, which represent the majority in their genomes. Functional analysis of IGs has revealed a massive over-representation of signal transduction genes and genes encoding regulatory proteins important for growth, proliferation, and development. IGs also often display tissue-specific expression, usually in the nervous system and testis. These characteristics translate into IG-associated diseases, mainly neuropathies, developmental disorders, and cancer. IGs represent recent additions to the genome, created mostly by retroposition of processed mRNAs with retained functionality. Processing, nuclear export, and translation of these mRNAs should be hampered dramatically by the lack of splice factors, which normally tightly cover mature transcripts and govern their fate. However, natural IGs manage to maintain satisfactory expression levels. Different mechanisms by which IGs solve the problem of mRNA processing and nuclear export are discussed here, along with their possible impact on reporter studies.
Recent clinical studies have raised the clinically important question of the relationship between dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and prostate cancer (PCa) progression. The significance of DHT or 5α-reductase inhibitors (5ARI) in PCa development and progression has not yet been fully characterized. The aim of this study was to determine whether the initiation of DNA replication was influenced by DHT in PCa. Three cell lines were used. LNCaP: a human PCa cell line that exhibits androgen-dependent proliferation, C4-2: a human PCa cell line that exhibits androgen-independent proliferation, and C4-2AT6: a castration resistant prostate cancer cell line. Two 5ARIs, finasteride and dutasteride, were used. We examined the mRNA expression of the components of pre-replication complex (Pre-RC), CDC6, CDT1, and MCM2-7. DHT induced cell proliferation of LNCaP accompanied by significantly increased CDC6, CDT1, and MCM2-7 expression. In contrast to LNCaP, DHT inhibited cell proliferation in C4-2AT6 cells accompanied by decreased expression of CDC6, CDT1, and MCM2-7. These reverse effects resemble the effects of 5ARIs in Pre-RC. Treatment with finasteride or dutasteride inhibited CDC6 expression in LNCaP, but both 5ARIs induced CDC6 expression in C4-2 and C4-2AT6 cells.These results indicate that DHT showed reversal effects on PCa cell proliferation among prostate cancer cells based on androgen-dependence, accompanied by regulation of the initiation of DNA replication. 5ARIs may modulate the DNA replication system in someaggressive PCa through up-regulation of CDC6 expression.
OBJECTIVE: To review and summarize data on olaratumab, which was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in October 2016, in combination with doxorubicin, for the treatment of advanced soft tissue sarcoma.DATA SOURCES: A literature search using PubMed was conducted using the search terms olaratumab, IMC-3G3, and advanced soft tissue sarcoma from January 2005 to June 2017.STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: The literature search was confined to human studies published in English. Trials of olaratumab for advanced soft tissue sarcomas were prioritized.DATA SYNTHESIS: Olaratumab is a human antiplatelet-derived growth factor receptor α monoclonal antibody. Its accelerated FDA approval was based on a phase II randomized trial of olaratumab plus doxorubicin (n = 66) versus doxorubicin monotherapy (n = 67) in patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma. Olaratumab 15 mg/kg was administered intravenously (IV) on days 1 and 8 in combination with doxorubicin 75 mg/m2 IV on day 1 every 21 days for a total of 8 cycles compared to doxorubicin 75 mg/m2 IV monotherapy. The response rate was 18.2% with combination therapy versus 11.9% with monotherapy and median progression-free survival of 6.6 and 4.1 months, respectively. Additionally, overall survival was increased by 11.8 months in the olaratumab arm (26.5 months vs 14.7 months). Clinically relevant adverse effects in the olaratumab + doxorubicin arm included neutropenia (58%), mucositis (53%), nausea (73%), vomiting (45%), and diarrhea (34%).CONCLUSION: Olaratumab, in combination with doxorubicin, represents a novel treatment strategy for advanced soft tissue sarcoma and provides a significant survival advantage for this rare disease state with limited treatment options.
PURPOSE: Agents inhibiting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) have shown clinical benefit in a subset of non-small cell lung cancer patients expressing amplified or mutationally activated EGFR. However, responsive patients can relapse as a result of selection for EGFR gene mutations that confer resistance to ATP competitive EGFR inhibitors, such as erlotinib and gefitinib. We describe here the activity of EXEL-7647 (XL647), a novel spectrum-selective kinase inhibitor with potent activity against the EGF and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase families, against both wild-type (WT) and mutant EGFR in vitro and in vivo.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The activity of EGFR inhibitors against WT and mutant EGFRs and their effect on downstream signal transduction was examined in cellular assays and in vivo using A431 and MDA-MB-231 (WT EGFR) and H1975 (L858R and T790M mutant EGFR) xenograft tumors.RESULTS: EXEL-7647 shows potent and long-lived inhibition of the WT EGFR in vivo. In addition, EXEL-7647 inhibits cellular proliferation and EGFR pathway activation in the erlotinib-resistant H1975 cell line that harbors a double mutation (L858R and T790M) in the EGFR gene. In vivo efficacy studies show that EXEL-7647 substantially inhibited the growth of H1975 xenograft tumors and reduced both tumor EGFR signaling and tumor vessel density. Additionally, EXEL-7647, in contrast to erlotinib, substantially inhibited the growth and vascularization of MDA-MB-231 xenografts, a model which is more reliant on signaling through vascular endothelial growth factor receptors.CONCLUSIONS: These studies provide a preclinical basis for clinical trials of XL647 in solid tumors and in patients bearing tumors that are resistant to existing EGFR-targeted therapies.
Anticitrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs) constitute a class of autoantibodies found in 60-70% of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The most common test for ACPA positivity is based on the occurrence of antibodies that bind to circular citrullinated peptides, so-called CCP, some of which are derived from endogenously citrullinated proteins, like filaggrin. Several lines of evidence suggest that these autoantibodies may confer pathological reactions. They appear years before onset of clinical disease and are associated with worse prognosis and a more erosive disease. Their presence correlates with the most prominent genetic risk factors for RA development, and they were recently described to mediate relevant biological functions such as activation of complement system and induction of osteoclastogenesis. The development of new drugs that specifically target these autoantibodies is an appealing and novel approach. Herein, we briefly review the autoimmune condition of RA, characterized by the presence of ACPA, and we describe how the neutralization of autoantibodies might become a novel pharmacological principle.
Clioquinol (CQ), a once popular antibiotic, was used to inhibit the growth of microorganisms. Recently, CQ and its analog PBT2 have shown encouraging effects in the animal and clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the mechanism by which this class of molecules works remains controversial. In this work, we used the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model to study how CQ affects molecular and cellular functions and particularly, copper, iron, and zinc homeostasis. We observed a CQ-induced inhibition of yeast growth, which could be slightly relieved by supplementation of copper or iron. Microarray results indicated that yeast cells treated with CQ sense a general deficiency in metals, despite elevated total cellular contents of copper and iron. Consistent with this, reduced activities of some metal-sensitive enzymes were observed. Intriguingly, CQ can increase the SOD1 activity, likely through Ccs1's accessibility to CQ-bound copper ions. Further studies revealed that CQ sequestrates copper and iron at the cellular membrane, likely the plasma membrane, resulting overall metal accumulation but cytosolic metal depletion. CQ's effects on metal-sensitive metalloenzymes were also verified in mammalian cell line SH-SY5Y. Together, our results revealed that CQ can regulate metal homeostasis by binding metal ions, resulting the cell sensing a state of deficiency of bioavailable metal ions while simultaneously increasing available metals to SOD1 (via Ccs1) and possibly some other metalloproteins that can access CQ-bound metals. We hope this regulation of metal homeostasis may be helpful in explaining the therapeutic effects of CQ used in disease treatment.
Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is an autoimmune acute peripheral neuropathy. Frequently a flu-like episode or a gastroenteritis precede GBS, and the cross-reactivity between microbial and neural antigens partly explains the pathophysiology of the disease and the possible detection of antiganglioside antibodies. The weakness reaches its nadir in 2-4 weeks: the patients may be chair- or bed-bound, may need artificial ventilation and frequently experience dysautonomic dysfunction; 5-15% of the patients die and more patients are left with a disabling motor deficit and/or fatigue. Electrophysiology and cerebrospinal fluid evaluation support the diagnosis. The treatment of GBS is multidisciplinary, and both plasma exchange and high dose immunoglobulin (IVIg) are effective in reducing both the severity of the disease and the residual deficits. Finally, steroids are not effective in GBS.
Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a major human pathogen that has evolved survival mechanisms to persist in an immune-competent host under a dormant condition. The regulation of M. tuberculosis metabolism during latent infection is not clearly known. The dormancy survival regulon (DosR regulon) is chiefly responsible for encoding dormancy related functions of M. tuberculosis. We describe functional characterization of an important gene of DosR regulon, Rv0079, which appears to be involved in the regulation of translation through the interaction of its product with bacterial ribosomal subunits. The protein encoded by Rv0079, possibly, has an inhibitory role with respect to protein synthesis, as revealed by our experiments. We performed computational modelling and docking simulation studies involving the protein encoded by Rv0079 followed by in vitro translation and growth curve analysis experiments, involving recombinant E. coli and Bacille Calmette Guérin (BCG) strains that overexpressed Rv0079. Our observations concerning the interaction of the protein with the ribosomes are supportive of its role in regulation/inhibition of translation. We propose that the protein encoded by locus Rv0079 is a 'dormancy associated translation inhibitor' or DATIN.
BACKGROUND: We analyzed the characteristics associated with increased risk of osteoporosis in patients with Crohn's disease in Malta.METHOD: Eighty-three patients with histologically and endoscopically confirmed Crohn's disease underwent a DEXA bone density scan and their phenotypic characteristics were analyzed.RESULTS: There was a significant association between body mass index and bone mineral density (P = 0.004) and a significant difference in the T scores of patients according to age at diagnosis (Montreal Classification: P = 0.0006) with patients diagnosed <17 years (n = 13) having lower T scores than those diagnosed at older age groups (n = 70). There was a significant difference between the T scores of patients on infliximab (n = 33) and those not on biological therapy (n = 50, P = 0.0058). Patients with high cumulative corticosteroid doses (>10 mg/d for >3 mo, n = 18) had lower bone mineral densities than patients who received smaller corticosteroid doses (P = 0.013). There was however no significant difference in the T scores of patients according to disease location (P = 0.18), disease type (P = 0.64), gender (P = 0.30), and history of ileal resection (P = 0.68). There was also no significant correlation between disease duration and T scores (hip) (P = 0.61).CONCLUSIONS: Low body mass index, early disease onset, high corticosteroid doses and, anti-tumor necrosis factor α therapy are associated with increased risk of osteoporosis. Lower T scores in patients on infliximab occur as patients receiving this therapy have more severe inflammation, which is associated with elevated osteoclastogenic factors, rather than as a side-effect of the anti-tumor necrosis factor-α therapy.
Chromatin boundary elements serve as cis-acting regulatory DNA signals required to protect genes from the effects of the neighboring heterochromatin. In the yeast genome, boundary elements act by establishing barriers for heterochromatin spreading and are sufficient to protect a reporter gene from transcriptional silencing when inserted between the silencer and the reporter gene. Here we dissected functional topography of silencers and boundary elements within circular minichromosomes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We found that both HML-E and HML-I silencers can efficiently repress the URA3 reporter on a multi-copy yeast minichromosome and we further showed that two distinct heterochromatin boundary elements STAR and TEF2-UASrpg are able to limit the heterochromatin spreading in circular minichromosomes. In surprising contrast to what had been observed in the yeast genome, we found that in minichromosomes the heterochromatin boundary elements inhibit silencing of the reporter gene even when just one boundary element is positioned at the distal end of the URA3 reporter or upstream of the silencer elements. Thus the STAR and TEF2-UASrpg boundary elements inhibit chromatin silencing through an antisilencing activity independently of their position or orientation in S. cerevisiae minichromosomes rather than by creating a position-specific barrier as seen in the genome. We propose that the circular DNA topology facilitates interactions between the boundary and silencing elements in the minichromosomes.
PURPOSE: Trastuzumab is an important biologic agent with significant activity in breast cancers that overexpress the HER2/neu marker. However, trastuzumab is associated with cardiotoxicity that has not yet been fully explored. We present our experience with patients who developed trastuzumab-related cardiotoxicity.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Over a 4-year period, 38 patients with HER2/neu-positive breast cancer were referred for suspected trastuzumab-related cardiotoxicity. All patients had previously received anthracycline-based chemotherapy. Results After doxorubicin but before trastuzumab, the mean (+/- standard deviation) left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 0.61 +/- 0.13, and the LVEF decreased to 0.43 +/- 0.16 after trastuzumab (P < .0001). After withdrawal of trastuzumab, the LVEF increased to 0.56 +/- 0.11. Mean time to recovery of LVEF was 1.5 months and was temporally associated with medical treatment in 32 (84%) of the 38 patients but occurred without treatment in six patients (16%). Increases in LVEF were noted in 37 of the 38 patients. Twenty-five of these patients were re-treated with trastuzumab; three patients had recurrent left ventricular dysfunction, but 22 patients (88%) did not. All re-treatment patients continued on their therapeutic regimen for heart failure when rechallenged with trastuzumab. Nine patients underwent endomyocardial biopsy. Ultrastructural changes were not seen.CONCLUSION: Patients who develop cardiotoxicity while receiving trastuzumab therapy generally improve on removal of the agent. The mechanism of trastuzumab-related cardiac dysfunction is different from that of anthracycline cardiotoxicity, in part, demonstrated by the absence of anthracycline-like ultrastructural changes. Reintroducing trastuzumab may be appropriate for some individuals who previously have experienced trastuzumab-related cardiac dysfunction.
To model inflammatory bowel disease, we assessed infection with Helicobacter hepaticus 3B1 (ATCC 51449) and a potential probiotic Lactobacillus reuteri (ATCC PTA-6475) in gnotobiotic B6.129P2-IL-10(tm1Cgn) (IL-10(-/-) ) mice. No typhlocolitis developed in germ-free controls (n=21) or in L. reuteri (n=8) or H. hepaticus (n=18) mono-associated mice for 20 weeks post-infection. As positive controls, three specific pathogen-free IL-10(-/-) mice dosed with H. hepaticus developed severe typhlocolitis within 11 weeks. Because L. reuteri PTA-6475 has anti-inflammatory properties in vitro, it was unexpected to observe significant typhlocolitis (P<0·0001) in mice that had been infected with L. reuteri followed in 1 week by H. hepaticus (n=16). The H. hepaticus colonization was not affected through 20 weeks post-infection but L. reuteri colonization was lower in co-infected compared with L. reuteri mono-associated mice at 8-11 weeks post-infection (P<0·05). Typhlocolitis was associated with an increased T helper type 1 serum IgG2c response to H. hepaticus in co-infected mice compared with H. hepaticus mono-associated mice (P<0·005) and similarly, mRNA expression in caecal-colonic tissue was elevated at least twofold for chemokine ligands and pro-inflammatory interleukin-1α (IL-1α), IL-1β, IL-12 receptor, tumour necrosis factor-α and inducible nitric oxide synthase. Anti-inflammatory transforming growth factor-β, lactotransferrin, peptidoglycan recognition proteins, Toll-like receptors 4, 6, 8 and particularly 9 gene expression, were also elevated only in co-infected mice (P<0·05). These data support that the development of typhlocolitis in H. hepaticus-infected IL-10(-/-) mice required co-colonization with other microbiota and in this study, required only L. reuteri. Although the effects other microbiota may have on H. hepaticus virulence properties remain speculative, further investigations using this gnotobiotic model are now possible.
Patient adherence to many osteoporosis treatments, primarily bisphosphonates, is generally poor, thus leading to a significant reduction in antifracture efficacy. Patient perceptions about the necessity of the prescribed medication to treat osteoporosis and the concerns about the potential adverse effects are important and potentially modifiable determinants of adherence, in addition to other factors, such as difficult dosing regimens and high dosing frequency. Denosumab (Dmab) is a fully human monoclonal antibody against the receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL), which, through the prevention of the RANKL/RANK interaction, inhibits osteoclast-mediated bone resorption and significantly reduces the risk of vertebral, nonvertebral, and hip fractures. It is administered subcutaneously every 6 months for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Preference and adherence to Dmab treatment were assessed in various clinical trials. Although with some limitations, available data suggest that Dmab is preferred to bisphosphonates, produces greater satisfaction than bisphosphonates, and would be preferentially chosen for long-term treatment. Moreover, patient perceptions about the necessity of Dmab treatment clearly outweigh the concerns about the injections, and positive beliefs about treatment positively influence medication-taking behavior. According to these data, Dmab may represent a reasonable alternative to bisphosphonates, particularly for osteoporotic women in whom a suboptimal or even poor adherence to oral treatments is expected.
Denosumab (Prolia) is a fully human monoclonal antibody directed against receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL), which interferes with the formation, activation, and survival of osteoclasts. It was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in June 2010 as a new treatment for postmenopausal osteoporosis in women who are at high risk for fracture. Given its mechanism of action, it is an antiresorptive therapy that is administered as a 60-mg subcutaneous injection every 6 months. It is the first biologic antiresorptive therapy for osteoporosis, and the first osteoporosis therapy to show efficacy and safety in patients with renal impairment.
P54nrb is a protein implicated in multiple nuclear processes whose specific functions may correlate with its presence at different nuclear locations. Here we characterize paraspeckles, a subnuclear domain containing p54nrb and other RNA-binding proteins including PSP1, a protein with sequence similarity to p54nrb that acts as a marker for paraspeckles. We show that PSP1 interacts in vivo with a subset of the total cellular pool of p54nrb. We map the domain within PSP1 that is mediating this interaction and show it is required for the correct localization of PSP1 to paraspeckles. This interaction is necessary but not sufficient for paraspeckle targeting by PSP1, which also requires an RRM capable of RNA binding. Blocking the reinitiation of RNA Pol II transcription at the end of mitosis with DRB prevents paraspeckle formation, which recommences after removal of DRB, indicating that paraspeckle formation is dependent on RNA Polymerase II transcription. Thus paraspeckles are the sites where a subset of the total cellular pool of p54nrb is targeted in a RNA Polymerase II-dependent manner.
Protein scaffolds have emerged as important regulators of MAPK cascades, facilitating kinase activation and providing crucial spatio/temporal control to their signaling outputs. Using a proteomics approach to compare the binding partners of the two mammalian KSR scaffolds, we find that both KSR1 and KSR2 interact with the kinase components of the ERK cascade and have a common function in promoting RTK-mediated ERK signaling. Strikingly, we find that the protein phosphatase calcineurin selectively interacts with KSR2 and that KSR2 uniquely contributes to Ca2+-mediated ERK signaling. Calcineurin dephosphorylates KSR2 on specific sites in response to Ca2+ signals, thus regulating KSR2 localization and activity. Moreover, we find that depletion of endogenous KSR2 impairs Ca2+-mediated ERK activation and ERK-dependent signaling responses in INS1 pancreatic beta-cells and NG108 neuroblastoma cells. These findings identify KSR2 as a Ca2+-regulated ERK scaffold and reveal a new mechanism whereby Ca2+ impacts Ras to ERK pathway signaling.
Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of the most severe form of malaria in humans invades erythrocytes using multiple ligand-receptor interactions. The P. falciparum reticulocyte binding-like homologue proteins (PfRh or PfRBL) are important for entry of the invasive merozoite form of the parasite into red blood cells. We have analysed two members of this protein family, PfRh2a and PfRh2b, and show they undergo a complex series of proteolytic cleavage events before and during merozoite invasion. We show that PfRh2a undergoes a cleavage event in the transmembrane region during invasion consistent with activity of the membrane associated PfROM4 protease that would result in release of the ectodomain into the supernatant. We also show that PfRh2a and PfRh2b bind to red blood cells and have defined the erythrocyte-binding domain to a 15 kDa region at the N-terminus of each protein. Antibodies to this receptor-binding region block merozoite invasion demonstrating the important function of this domain. This region of PfRh2a and PfRh2b has potential in a combination vaccine with other erythrocyte binding ligands for induction of antibodies that would block a broad range of invasion pathways for P. falciparum into human erythrocytes.
We describe a case of hemitrophy in a 12-year-old child presenting with seizures, hemiplegia and mental retardation. Hemiatrophy of one cerebral hemisphere is not frequently encountered in clinical practice. When this develops early in life (during the first two years), certain cranial changes like ipsilateral hypertrophy of the skull and sinuses occur. Asymmetry of cerebral hemispheric growth with atrophy on one side, ipsilateral osseous hypertrophy and hyper-pneumatization of sinuses with contralateral paresis are features of Dyke Davidoff Masson Syndrome (DDMS). Probably vascular occlusion was most important cause of hemiatrophy in our case.
Indoloquinoline alkaloids represent an important class of antimalarial, antibacterial and antiviral compounds. Indolo[2,3-b]quinolines are a family of DNA intercalators and inhibitors of topoisomerase II, synthetic analogs of neocryptolepine, an alkaloid traditionally used in African folk medicine. These cytotoxic substances are promising anticancer agents. Active representatives of indolo[2,3-b]quinolines affect model and natural membranes. The distinct structure and hydrophobicity of the compounds leads to marked differences in the disturbing effects on membrane organization and function. Our results also indicated a strong relationship between the presence of the chain and the Poct of the molecule as well as the capacity for incorporation into carboxyfluorescein-trapped liposomes in the 0.02-0.06 mM range. Moreover, a correlation between binding to neutral dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) or negative charged dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine:dimyristoylphosphatidylglycerol (DMPC:DMPG, 9:1 w/w) liposomes, as well as to erythrocyte ghosts and pKa, was also found. All the compounds cause hemolysis in isotonic conditions with concentration causing 50% hemolysis (HC50) in the 0.12-0.88 mM range. The concentration-dependent inhibitory effect of the tested agents on erythrocyte ghosts' acetylcholinesterase activity was also studied.
Operons are primarily a bacterial phenomenon, not commonly observed in eukaryotes. However, new research indicates that operons are found in higher organisms as well. There are instances of operons found in C. elegans, Drosophila melanogaster and other eukaryotic species. We developed a prototype using positional, structural and gene expression information to identify candidate operons. We focused our efforts on "trans-spliced" operons in which the pre-mRNA is trans-spliced into individual transcripts and subsequently translated, as widely observed in C. elegans and some instances in Drosophila. We identify several candidate operons in Drosophila melanogaster of which two have been subsequently molecularly validated.
Of the many inherited Charcot-Marie-Tooth peripheral neuropathies, type 2D (CMT2D) is caused by dominant point mutations in the gene GARS, encoding glycyl tRNA synthetase (GlyRS). Here we report a dominant mutation in Gars that causes neuropathy in the mouse. Importantly, both sensory and motor axons are affected, and the dominant phenotype is not caused by a loss of the GlyRS aminoacylation function. Mutant mice have abnormal neuromuscular junction morphology and impaired transmission, reduced nerve conduction velocities, and a loss of large-diameter peripheral axons, without defects in myelination. The mutant GlyRS enzyme retains aminoacylation activity, and a loss-of-function allele, generated by a gene-trap insertion, shows no dominant phenotype in mice. These results indicate that the CMT2D phenotype is caused not by reduction of the canonical GlyRS activity and insufficiencies in protein synthesis, but instead by novel pathogenic roles for the mutant GlyRS that specifically affect peripheral neurons.
LIM homeodomain transcription factors are critical regulators of early development in multiple systems but have yet to be examined for a role in circuit formation. The LIM homeobox gene Lhx2 is expressed in cortical progenitors during development and also in the superficial layers of the neocortex in maturity. However, analysis of Lhx2 function at later stages of cortical development has been hampered by severe phenotypes associated with early loss of function. We identified a particular Cre-recombinase line that acts in the cortical primordium after its specification is complete, permitting an analysis of Lhx2 function in neocortical lamination, regionalization, and circuit formation by selective elimination of Lhx2 in the dorsal telencephalon. We report a profound disruption of cortical neuroanatomical and molecular features upon loss of Lhx2 in the cortex from embryonic day 11.5. A unique feature of cortical circuitry, the somatosensory barrels, is undetectable, and molecular patterning of cortical regions appears disrupted. Surprisingly, thalamocortical afferents innervate the mutant cortex with apparently normal regional specificity. Electrophysiological recordings reveal a loss of responses evoked by stimulation of individual whiskers, but responses to simultaneous stimulation of multiple whiskers were present, suggesting that thalamic afferents are unable to organize the neurocircuitry for barrel formation because of a cortex-specific requirement of Lhx2. We report that Lhx2 is required for the expression of transcription factor paired box gene 6, axon guidance molecule Ephrin A5, and the receptor NMDA receptor 1. These genes may mediate Lhx2 function in the formation of specialized neurocircuitry necessary for neocortical function.
Genome-wide pervasive transcription has been reported in many eukaryotic organisms, revealing a highly interleaved transcriptome organization that involves hundreds of previously unknown non-coding RNAs. These recently identified transcripts either exist stably in cells (stable unannotated transcripts, SUTs) or are rapidly degraded by the RNA surveillance pathway (cryptic unstable transcripts, CUTs). One characteristic of pervasive transcription is the extensive overlap of SUTs and CUTs with previously annotated features, which prompts questions regarding how these transcripts are generated, and whether they exert function. Single-gene studies have shown that transcription of SUTs and CUTs can be functional, through mechanisms involving the generated RNAs or their generation itself. So far, a complete transcriptome architecture including SUTs and CUTs has not been described in any organism. Knowledge about the position and genome-wide arrangement of these transcripts will be instrumental in understanding their function. Here we provide a comprehensive analysis of these transcripts in the context of multiple conditions, a mutant of the exosome machinery and different strain backgrounds of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We show that both SUTs and CUTs display distinct patterns of distribution at specific locations. Most of the newly identified transcripts initiate from nucleosome-free regions (NFRs) associated with the promoters of other transcripts (mostly protein-coding genes), or from NFRs at the 3' ends of protein-coding genes. Likewise, about half of all coding transcripts initiate from NFRs associated with promoters of other transcripts. These data change our view of how a genome is transcribed, indicating that bidirectionality is an inherent feature of promoters. Such an arrangement of divergent and overlapping transcripts may provide a mechanism for local spreading of regulatory signals-that is, coupling the transcriptional regulation of neighbouring genes by means of transcriptional interference or histone modification.
Mutations in the HPRT gene cause a spectrum of diseases that ranges from hyperuricemia alone to hyperuricemia with profound neurological and behavioral dysfunction. The extreme phenotype is termed Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. In 271 cases in which the germinal HPRT mutation has been characterized, 218 different mutations have been found. Of these, 34 (13%) are large- (macro-) deletions of one exon or greater and four (2%) are partial gene duplications. The deletion breakpoint junctions have been defined for only three of the 34 macro-deletions. The molecular basis of two of the four duplications has been defined. We report here the breakpoint junctions for three new deletion mutations, encompassing exons 4-8 (20033bp), exons 4 and 5 (13307bp) and exons 5 and 6 (9454bp), respectively. The deletion breakpoints were defined by a combination of long polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplifications, and conventional PCR and DNA sequencing. All three deletions are the result of non-homologous recombinations. A fourth mutation, a duplication of exons 2 and 3, is the result of an Alu-mediated homologous recombination between identical 19bp sequences in introns 3 and 1. In toto, two of three germinal HPRT duplication mutations appear to have been caused by Alu-mediated homologous recombination, while only one of six deletion mutations appears to have resulted from this type of recombination mechanism. The other five deletion mutations resulted from non-homologous recombination. With this admittedly limited number of characterized macro-mutations, Alu-mediated unequal homologous recombinations account for at least 8% (3 of 38) of the macro-alterations and 1% (3 of 271) of the total HPRT germinal mutations.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of naltrexone/bupropion (NB) combination therapy on weight and weight-related risk factors in overweight and obese participants.DESIGN AND METHODS: CONTRAVE Obesity Research-II (COR-II) was a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 1,496 obese (BMI 30-45 kg/m(2) ) or overweight (27-45 kg/m(2) with dyslipidemia and/or hypertension) participants randomized 2:1 to combined naltrexone sustained-release (SR) (32 mg/day) plus bupropion SR (360 mg/day) (NB32) or placebo for up to 56 weeks. The co-primary endpoints were percent weight change and proportion achieving ≥ 5% weight loss at week 28.RESULTS: Significantly (P < 0.001) greater weight loss was observed with NB32 versus placebo at week 28 (-6.5% vs. -1.9%) and week 56 (-6.4% vs. -1.2%). More NB32-treated participants (P < 0.001) experienced ≥ 5% weight loss versus placebo at week 28 (55.6% vs. 17.5%) and week 56 (50.5% vs. 17.1%). NB32 produced greater improvements in various cardiometabolic risk markers, participant-reported weight-related quality of life, and control of eating. The most common adverse event with NB was nausea, which was generally mild to moderate and transient. NB was not associated with increased events of depression or suicidality versus placebo.CONCLUSION: NB represents a novel pharmacological approach to the treatment of obesity, and may become a valuable new therapeutic option.
This article presents the strategies underlying the automated identification and quantification of individual lipid molecular species through array analysis of multidimensional mass spectrometry-based shotgun lipidomics (MDMS-SL) data, which are acquired directly from lipid extracts after direct infusion and intrasource separation. The automated analyses of individual lipid molecular species in the program employ a strategy in which MDMS-SL data from building block analyses using precursor ion scans, neutral loss scans, or both are used to identify individual molecular species, followed by quantitation. Through this strategy, the program screens and identifies species in a high-throughput fashion from a built-in database of over 36,000 potential lipid molecular species constructed employing known building blocks. The program then uses a two-step procedure for quantitation of the identified species possessing a linear dynamic range over 3 orders of magnitude and reverifies the results when necessary through redundant quantification of multidimensional mass spectra. This program is designed to be easily adaptable for other shotgun lipidomics approaches that are currently used for mass spectrometric analysis of lipids. Accordingly, the development of this program should greatly accelerate high-throughput analysis of lipids using MDMS-based shotgun lipidomics.
BACKGROUND: Intra-sample cellular heterogeneity presents numerous challenges to the identification of biomarkers in large Epigenome-Wide Association Studies (EWAS). While a number of reference-based deconvolution algorithms have emerged, their potential remains underexplored and a comparative evaluation of these algorithms beyond tissues such as blood is still lacking.RESULTS: Here we present a novel framework for reference-based inference, which leverages cell-type specific DNAse Hypersensitive Site (DHS) information from the NIH Epigenomics Roadmap to construct an improved reference DNA methylation database. We show that this leads to a marginal but statistically significant improvement of cell-count estimates in whole blood as well as in mixtures involving epithelial cell-types. Using this framework we compare a widely used state-of-the-art reference-based algorithm (called constrained projection) to two non-constrained approaches including CIBERSORT and a method based on robust partial correlations. We conclude that the widely-used constrained projection technique may not always be optimal. Instead, we find that the method based on robust partial correlations is generally more robust across a range of different tissue types and for realistic noise levels. We call the combined algorithm which uses DHS data and robust partial correlations for inference, EpiDISH (Epigenetic Dissection of Intra-Sample Heterogeneity). Finally, we demonstrate the added value of EpiDISH in an EWAS of smoking.CONCLUSIONS: Estimating cell-type fractions and subsequent inference in EWAS may benefit from the use of non-constrained reference-based cell-type deconvolution methods.
Germline mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are associated with hereditary predisposition to breast and ovarian cancer. Sensitive and accurate detection of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations is crucial for personalized clinical management of individuals affected by breast or ovarian cancer, and for the identification of at-risk healthy relatives. We performed molecular analysis of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes in 898 Greek families, using Sanger sequencing or Next Generation Sequencing for the detection of small insertion/deletion frameshift, nonsynonymous, truncating and splice-site alterations and MLPA for the detection of large genomic rearrangements. In total, a pathogenic mutation was identified in 12.9% of 898 families analyzed. Of the 116 mutations identified in total 9% were novel and 14.7% were large genomic rearrangements. Our results indicate that different types of mutational events in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are responsible for the hereditary component of breast/ovarian cancer in the Greek population. Therefore the methodology used in the analysis of Greek patients must be able to detect both point and small frameshift mutations in addition to large genomic rearrangements across the entire coding region of the two genes.
BACKGROUND: Since the publication of the first European Federation of Neurological Societies (EFNS) guidelines in 2005 on the management of restless legs syndrome (RLS; also known as Willis-Ekbom disease), there have been major therapeutic advances in the field. Furthermore, the management of RLS is now a part of routine neurological practice in Europe. New drugs have also become available, and further randomized controlled trials have been undertaken. These guidelines were undertaken by the EFNS in collaboration with the European Neurological Society and the European Sleep Research Society.OBJECTIVES: To provide an evidence-based update of new treatments published since 2005 for the management of RLS.METHODS: First, we determined what the objectives of management of primary and secondary RLS should be. We developed the search strategy and conducted a review of the scientific literature up to 31 December 2011 (print and electronic publications) for the drug classes and interventions employed in RLS treatment. Previous guidelines were consulted. All trials were analysed according to class of evidence, and recommendations made according to the 2004 EFNS criteria for rating.RECOMMENDATIONS: Level A recommendations can be made for rotigotine, ropinirole, pramipexole, gabapentin enacarbil, gabapentin and pregabalin, which are all considered effective for the short-term treatment for RLS. However, for the long-term treatment for RLS, rotigotine is considered effective, gabapentin enacarbil is probably effective, and ropinirole, pramipexole and gabapentin are considered possibly effective. Cabergoline has according to our criteria a level A recommendation, but the taskforce cannot recommend this drug because of its serious adverse events.
BACKGROUND: AQ4N (1,4-bis[[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl] amino]-5,8-dihydroxyanthracene-9, 10-dione bis-N-oxide dihydrochloride) is a prodrug which is selectively activated within hypoxic tissues to AQ4, a topoisomerase II inhibitor and DNA intercalator.PATIENTS AND METHODS: In the phase I study, 22 patients with oesophageal carcinoma received an i.v. infusion of AQ4N (22.5-447 mg/m(2)) followed, 2 weeks later, by further infusion and radiotherapy. Pharmacokinetics and lymphocyte AQ4N and AQ4 levels were measured after the first dose. At 447 mg/m(2), biopsies of tumour and normal tissue were taken after AQ4N administration.RESULTS: Drug-related adverse events were blue discolouration of skin and urine, grade 2-3 lymphopenia, grade 1-3 fatigue, grade 1-2 anaemia, leucopenia and nausea. There were no drug-related serious adverse events (SAEs). Three patients had reductions in tumour volume >50%, nine had stable disease. Pharmacokinetics indicated predictable clearance. Plasma area under the curve (AUC) at 447 mg/m(2) exceeded AQ4N concentrations in mice at therapeutic doses and tumour biopsies contained concentrations of AQ4 greater than those in normal tissue. Tumour concentrations of AQ4 exceeded in vitro IC(50) values for most cell lines investigated.CONCLUSIONS: No dose-limiting toxic effects were observed and a maximum tolerated dose was not established. Tumour AQ4 concentrations and plasma AUC at 447 mg/m(2) exceeded active levels in preclinical models. This dose was chosen for future studies with radiotherapy.
The present case study is on a 16-year-old woman who was suffering from nephrotic syndrome after recovery from complete type of hydatiform mole. She was admitted in hospital because of proteinurea and hematuria. Then she was showing a generalized edema compatible with neprhotic syndrome. In her past medical history she had a suction curettage for hydatiform mole. After she received 4 courses chemotherapy, she completely recovered and βhCG has fallen from 12127 IU/L to under 10 IU/mL. Then she showed generalized edema, proteinurea and hematuria compatible with nephritic syndrome. After six courses chemotherapy the symptoms of nephrotic syndrome and invasive mole diminished, she released from hospital and scheduled for follow-up.
BACKGROUND/AIMS: This study aimed to determine the performance of the AIMS65 score (AIMS65), Glasgow-Blatchford score (GBS), and Rockall score (RS) in predicting outcomes in patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), and to compare the results between patients with nonvariceal UGIB (NVUGIB) and those with variceal UGIB (VUGIB).METHODS: We conducted a prospective observational study between March 2016 and December 2017. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed for all outcomes for comparison. The associations of all three scores with mortality were evaluated using multivariate logistic regression analysis.RESULTS: Of the total of 337 patients with UGIB, 267 patients (79.2%) had NVUGIB. AIMS65 was significantly associated (odds ratio [OR], 1.735; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.148-2.620), RS was marginally associated (OR, 1.225; 95% CI, 0.973-1.543), but GBS was not associated (OR, 1.017; 95% CI, 0.890-1.163) with mortality risk in patients with UGIB. However, all three scores accurately predicted all other outcomes (all p<0.05) except rebleeding (p>0.05). Only AIMS65 precisely predicted mortality, the need for blood transfusion and the composite endpoint (all p<0.05) in patients with VUGIB.CONCLUSION: AIMS65 is superior to GBS and RS in predicting mortality in patients with UGIB, and also precisely predicts the need for blood transfusion and the composite endpoint in patients with VUGIB. No scoring system could satisfactorily predict rebleeding in all patients with UGIB.
Plasmodium falciparum is the causative agent of the most severe form of human malaria. The rapid multiplication of the parasite within human erythrocytes requires an active production of new membranes. Phosphatidylcholine is the most abundant phospholipid in Plasmodium membranes, and the pathways leading to its synthesis are attractive targets for chemotherapy. In addition to its synthesis from choline, phosphatidylcholine is synthesized from serine via an unknown pathway. Serine, which is actively transported by Plasmodium from human serum and readily available in the parasite, is subsequently converted into phosphoethanolamine. Here, we describe in P. falciparum a plant-like S-adenosyl-l-methionine-dependent three-step methylation reaction that converts phosphoethanolamine into phosphocholine, a precursor for the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine. We have identified the gene, PfPMT, encoding this activity and shown that its product is an unusual phosphoethanolamine methyltransferase with no human homologs. P. falciparum phosphoethanolamine methyltransferase (Pfpmt) is a monopartite enzyme with a single catalytic domain that is responsible for the three-step methylation reaction. Interestingly, Pfpmt activity is inhibited by its product phosphocholine and by the phosphocholine analog, miltefosine. We show that miltefosine can also inhibit parasite proliferation within human erythrocytes. The importance of this enzyme in P. falciparum membrane biogenesis makes it a potential target for malaria chemotherapy.
In the late 1940s, a microanatomist from London Ontario, Murray Barr, discovered a mark of sex chromosome status in bodily tissues, what came to be known as the 'Barr body'. This discovery offered an important diagnostic technology to the burgeoning clinical science community engaged with the medical interpretation and management of sexual anomalies. It seemed to offer a way to identify the true, underlying sex in those whose bodies or lives were sexually anomalous (intersexuals, homosexuals and transsexuals). The hypothesis that allowed the Barr body to stand in for 'chromosomal' or 'genetic' sex was provisional, but it supported the expectation that genetic information established one's primary identity, and the conviction that the animal world could be neatly divided into two, and only two, sexes. Ultimately, this provisional hypothesis, and its status as an unambiguous arbiter of true sex, was overturned. But during much of the 1950s, Barr's thesis about the identity of the Barr body was consistent with a coherent set of theories and evidence explaining sexual development and sexual pathology. Though provisional, the scientific status of the sex chromatin within this system of knowledge was good enough to support a flourishing research enterprise in the clinical sciences.
The catechol-O-methyl transferase inhibitor entacapone is given in combination with levodopa/dopa decarboxylase inhibitor for Parkinson's disease (PD) patients experiencing end-of-dose wearing-off. This 4-week post-marketing surveillance study was undertaken to assess patients' responses to levodopa combined with entacapone in a real clinical practice setting. Overall, 466 patients with idiopathic PD treated with levodopa and experiencing symptoms of wearing-off were recruited. Both physicians and patients recorded the response to therapy, including improvements and side-effects. Following initiation of entacapone treatment, the average daily levodopa dose was reduced from 510 to 453 mg. Physician assessment of entacapone efficacy was judged to be "very good" or "good" in 77.6% of the patients, and tolerability was considered to be "very good" or "good" in 92.4% of patients, with only 12 patients (2.6%) withdrawing from the study. Compared with baseline, there was a decrease in the mean duration of daily 'off' time from 3.0 to 1.3 h per day during the treatment period. Adverse events were in line with those previously reported, with diarrhoea being the most frequent event. The percentage of patients suffering from dyskinesia decreased from 46 to 34%, and of those patients still suffering from dyskinesia, the average daily duration of dyskinesia was reduced from 2.2 to 1.7 h. The use of adjunct dopamine agonists decreased from 67 to 59%. At study end, the percentage of patients who rated their quality of life (QoL) as "very good" or "good" increased from 12.1 to 51.7% and the percentage of patients who rated their QoL as "bad" or "very bad" decreased from 40 to 10.7%. In summary, the results of this survey conducted in real clinical practice support the findings of previous clinical trials demonstrating the efficacy and tolerability of entacapone, as well as the benefits of improved QoL, for patients achieved with entacapone.
Systemic administration of naloxone usually produces either hyperalgesia or no change in nociception depending on the animal species used and/or the pain test employed. This study, however, demonstrates that naloxone produces a dose-dependent analgesia in the formalin pain test using an inbred strain of albino mouse. Female BALB/c, C57BL/6 and CD1 mice were injected subcutaneously with naloxone HCl in saline (0.1 10.0 mg/kg) or saline alone, and tested for analgesia using the formalin test. Naloxone produced a statistically significant dose-dependent analgesia in the BALB/c mice, with an ED50 of 0.24 mg/kg and almost total analgesia at doses of 1 mg/kg or greater. No changes in pain behaviour were observed in the C57BL/6 or CD1 strains of mice. We believe this to be the first report of analgesia following administration of doses of naloxone normally used for opioid antagonism. To determine if this effect was specific to the formalin test, the 3 strains of mice were injected subcutaneously with naloxone HCl and tested in the tail-flick test. Naloxone had no analgesic action in this test in any of the strains.
TDP-43, or TAR DNA-binding protein 43, is a pathological marker of a spectrum of neurodegenerative disorders, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin-positive inclusions. TDP-43 is an RNA/DNA-binding protein implicated in transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation. Recent work also suggests that TDP-43 associates with cytoplasmic stress granules, which are transient structures that form in response to stress. In this study, we establish sorbitol as a novel physiological stressor that directs TDP-43 to stress granules in Hek293T cells and primary cultured glia. We quantify the association of TDP-43 with stress granules over time and show that stress granule association and size are dependent on the glycine-rich region of TDP-43, which harbors the majority of pathogenic mutations. Moreover, we establish that cells harboring wild-type and mutant TDP-43 have distinct stress responses: mutant TDP-43 forms significantly larger stress granules, and is incorporated into stress granules earlier, than wild-type TDP-43; in striking contrast, wild-type TDP-43 forms more stress granules over time, but the granule size remains relatively unchanged. We propose that mutant TDP-43 alters stress granule dynamics, which may contribute to the progression of TDP-43 proteinopathies.
PURPOSE: The aim of this randomized, multicenter, noncomparative, phase II trial was to investigate the efficacy and safety of two potential first-line treatments, capecitabine and oxaliplatin (CapOX) plus bevacizumab (BEV) and capecitabine and irinotecan (CapIRI) plus bevacizumab, in Japanese patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with untreated mCRC were randomly assigned to receive either CapOX plus bevacizumab (CapOX/BEV arm: bevacizumab 7.5 mg/kg and oxaliplatin 130 mg/m2 on day 1 and oral capecitabine 2,000 mg/m2 on days 1-14, every 3 weeks) or CapIRI plus bevacizumab (CapIRI/BEV arm: bevacizumab 7.5 mg/kg and irinotecan 200 mg/m2 on day 1 and capecitabine 1,600 mg/m2 on days 1-14, every 3 weeks). The primary endpoint was overall response rate (ORR), and the secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety.RESULTS: A total of 107 patients were enrolled. The intent-to-treat population comprised 54 patients in the CapOX/BEV arm and 53 patients in the CapIRI/BEV arm. The median follow-up period was 35.5 months. ORR was 56% in the CapOX/BEV arm and 55% in the CapIRI/BEV arm. Median PFS and OS were 12.4 and 26.7 months in the CapOX/BEV arm and 11.5 and 28.7 months in the CapIRI/BEV arm, respectively. The frequencies of hematological and nonhematological adverse events above grade 3 were 13% and 30% in the CapOX/BEV arm and 25% and 23% in the CapIRI/BEV arm, respectively.CONCLUSION: CapOX plus bevacizumab and CapIRI plus bevacizumab are equally effective and feasible as the first-line treatments in Japanese patients with mCRC.IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The CCOG-1201 study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of capecitabine and oxaliplatin plus bevacizumab and capecitabine and irinotecan plus bevacizumab as a first-line treatment in Japanese patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. This article reports on the trial and efforts to define the role of these regimens, including the effect of KRAS status and UGT1A1 polymorphisms in metastatic colorectal cancer.
OBJECTIVES: Pulmonary pleomorphic carcinoma (PC) is a rare type of lung tumor with a dismal prognosis. There is no consensus on a chemotherapy regimen for PC, and conventional platinum-based chemotherapy has been associated with disappointing response rates and PFS. In searches for a new regimen, the sarcomatoid (spindle or giant cell) component has been assumed to be susceptible to chemotherapy used for soft tissue sarcoma.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The medical records of 17 patients who received mesna, doxorubicin, ifosfamide, and dacarbazine (MAID) for advanced PC between January 2010 and February 2017 were retrospectively analyzed for clinicopathological features and outcomes.RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The median age was 59 years. Sixteen patients were male, and only one patient had never smoked. Six patients achieved partial response to MAID, leading to an objective response rate of 35%. The median PFS was 2.8 months, and the median OS was 8.7 months. Hematologic toxicity-related adverse events were the most frequent, which comprised grade 3-4 anemia in 35% of patients, neutropenia in 47%, thrombocytopenia in 24%, and febrile neutropenia in 29%. No febrile neutropenia was reported in patients who received 5-day granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) prophylaxis. Most adverse events resolved without complications, except for one death due to sepsis. MAID is an effective, and possibly important, regimen for PC. MAID could be more safely used in clinical practice with appropriate dose modifications and G-CSF primary prophylaxis according to patients' status.
Focusing on three Anglo-American outbreaks of industrial anthrax, this essay engages the question of how local circumstances influenced the transmission of scientific knowledge in the late nineteenth century. Walpole (Massachusetts), Glasgow, and Bradford (Yorkshire) served as important nodes of transnational investigation into anthrax. Knowledge about the morphology and behavior of Bacillus anthracis changed little while in transit between these nodes, even during complex debates about the nature of bacterial morphology, disease causation, and spontaneous generation. Working independently of their more famous counterparts (Robert Koch and Louis Pasteur), Anglo-American anthrax investigators used visual representations of anthrax bacilli to persuade their peers that a specific, identifiable cause produced all forms of anthrax-malignant pustule (cutaneous anthrax), intestinal anthrax, and woolsorter's disease (pneumonic anthrax). By the late 1870s, this point of view also supported what we would today call an ecological notion of the disease's origins in the interactions of people, animals, and microorganisms in the context of global commerce.
In this work we analyze splicing mutations identified in propionic acidemia patients to clarify their functional effects and their involvement in the disease phenotype. Two mutations in the PCCA gene detected in homozygous patients and involving consensus splice sequences (IVS21+3del4 and IVS22-2A>G) were shown to produce some normal splicing in patients' cells, at very low levels, which were quantitated by real-time PCR methods, and which presumably are sufficient to moderate the phenotype. We have also analysed the effect of mutations c.653A>G and IVS10-11del6 in the PCCB gene present in heterozygous patients with mild phenotype. The c.653A>G mutation is located in the last codon of exon 6 and interferes with the correct spliceosomal assembly activating a cryptic splice site within exon 6, which leads to an in-frame six-nucleotide deletion (delV217-K218). Minigene analysis and sequence-specific hybridization probes using real-time PCR methods showed that no normally spliced transcript is detectable in the patients' fibroblasts. The IVS10-11del6 mutation shortens the polypyrimidine tract of the 3'-splice site of exon 11, resulting in exon skipping. Some normal transcript is detectable by allele-specific hybridization probes. These analyses suggest that, in some cases, the regulation of gene splicing can potentially play an important role in human disease influencing phenotypic parameters.
Recently, a unique clinicopathologic variant of multicentric Castleman's disease (MCD) has been identified in Japan. This disease is characterized by a constellation of symptoms, as listed in the title, and multiple lymphadenopathy of mild degree with a pathologic diagnosis of atypical CD, often posing diagnostic and therapeutic problems for pathologists and hematologists, respectively. These findings suggest that this disease represents a novel clinical entity belonging to systemic inflammatory disorders with a background of immunological abnormality beyond the ordinal spectrum of MCD. To define this disorder more clearly, Japanese participants presented clinicopathologic data at the Fukushima and Nagoya meetings. Many of the patients presented by the participants were significantly accompanied by a combination of thrombocytopenia, ascites (anasarca), pleural effusions, microcytic anemia, fever, myelofibrosis, renal dysfunction, and organomegaly (TAFRO). Multiple lymphadenopathies were generally of mild degree, less than 1.5 cm in diameter, and consistently featured the histopathology of mixed- or less hyaline vascular-type CD. Autoantibodies were often detected. However, this disease did not fulfill the diagnostic criteria for well-known autoimmune diseases including systemic lupus erythematosus. Castleman-Kojima disease and TAFRO syndrome (the favored clinical term) were proposed for this disease. The patients were sensitive to steroid and anti-interleukin-6 receptor antibody (tocilizumab), but some exhibited a deteriorated clinical course despite the treatment. The participants proposed a future nationwide survey and a Japanese consortium to facilitate further clinical and therapeutic studies of this novel disease. [J Clin Exp Hematop 53(1): 57-61, 2013].
The carpal tunnel syndrome is the most common entrapment syndrome of the upper limb. Compression of the median nerve is most often idiopathic and typically occurs in women aged 50. The diagnosis is clinical and must look for signs of gravity (hypoesthesia, thenar atrophy). The electromyogram is not required but recommended for surgical indication, It assesses the severity of the disease and identifies other injury. Conservative treatment is available in the beginner to moderate forms. In case of failure of this treatment or with severe objective signs, treatment is surgical. The ulnar nerve at the elbow comes in the second position of the upper limb entrapment syndromes. Clinical examination looks for signs of serious problems with objectives symptoms. Treatment is usually surgical.
HIV-1 virions assemble at the plasma membrane of mammalian cells and recruit the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery to enable particle release. However, little is known about the temporal and spatial organization of ESCRT protein recruitment. Using multiple-color live-cell total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, we observed that the ESCRT-I protein Tsg101 is recruited together with Gag to the sites of HIV-1 assembly, whereas later-acting ESCRT proteins (Chmp4b and Vps4A) are recruited sequentially, once Gag assembly is completed. Chmp4b, a protein that is required to mediate particle scission, is recruited to HIV-1 assembly sites ∼10 s before the ATPase Vps4A. Using two-color superresolution imaging, we observed that the ESCRT machinery (Tsg101, Alix, and Chmp4b/c proteins) is positioned at the periphery of the nascent virions, with the Tsg101 assemblages positioned closer to the Gag assemblages than Alix, Chmp4b, or Chmp4c. These results are consistent with the notion that the ESCRT machinery is recruited transiently to the neck of the assembling particle and is thus present at the appropriate time and place to mediate fission between the nascent virus and the plasma membrane.
AIM: Determine the long-term efficacy, safety and tolerability of avanafil, a highly specific, rapidly absorbed phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor in male patients with mild to severe erectile dysfunction (ED), with or without diabetes.METHODS: This was a 52-week, open-label extension of two 12-week, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trials. Patients were assigned to avanafil 100 mg, but could request 200 mg (for increased efficacy; '100/200-mg' group) or 50 mg (for improved tolerability). Primary end points included percentage of sexual attempts ending in successful vaginal penetration [Sexual Encounter Profile 2 (SEP2)] and intercourse (SEP3) and erectile function domain score per the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-EF).RESULTS: Some 712 patients enrolled; 686 were included in the intent to treat population and contributed to the data. All primary end points showed sustained improvement. SEP2 and SEP3 success rates improved from 44% to 83% and from 13% to 68% (100-mg group) and from 43% to 79% and from 11% to 66% (100/200-mg group), respectively. Mean IIEF-EF domain scores improved from 13.6 to 22.2 (100-mg group) and from 11.9 to 22.7 (100/200-mg group). Avanafil was effective in some patients ≤ 15 min and > 6 h postdose. Sixty-five per cent (112/172) of 'nonresponders' to avanafil 100 mg responded to the 200-mg dose. The most common (≥ 2%) treatment-emergent adverse events were headache, flushing, nasopharyngitis and nasal congestion; < 3% of patients discontinued therapy because of adverse events.CONCLUSIONS: The long-term tolerability and improvement in sexual function, coupled with rapid onset, suggest that avanafil is well suited for the on-demand treatment of ED.
Recent successes with monoclonal antibody cocktails ZMapp(TM) and MIL77 against Ebola virus (EBOV) infections have reignited interest in antibody-based therapeutics. Since the production process for monoclonal antibodies can be prolonged and costly, alternative treatments should be investigated. We produced purified equine antisera from horses hyperimmunized with EBOV virus-like particles, and tested the post-exposure efficacy of the antisera in a mouse model of infection. BALB/c mice were given up to 2 mg of purified equine antisera per animal, at 30 minutes, 1 or 2 days post-infection (dpi), in which all animals survived. To decrease the possibility of serum sickness, the equine antisera was digested with pepsin to generate F(ab')2 fragments, with in vitro neutralizing activity comparable to whole immunoglobulin. Full protection was achieved with when treatment was initiated at 1 dpi, but the suboptimal protection observed with the 30 minute and 2 dpi groups demonstrate that in addition to virus neutralization, other Fc-dependent antibody mechanisms may also contribute to survival. Guinea pigs given 20 mg of antisera or F(ab')2 at or starting at 1 or 2 dpi were also fully protected from EBOV infection. These results justify future efficacy studies for purified equine products in NHPs.
Recent years have seen rapid progress towards understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in X chromosome inactivation (X inactivation). This progress has largely revolved around the discovery of the X inactive specific transcript (Xist) gene, which is known now to represent the master switch locus regulating X inactivation. In adult cells Xist is transcribed exclusively from the inactive X chromosome. The transcript has no apparent protein-coding potential and is retained in the nucleus in close association with the domain occupied by the inactive X chromosome. It is thus thought to represent a functional RNA molecule which acts as the primary signal responsible for the propagation of X inactivation. Developmental regulation of Xist correlates with the developmental timing of X inactivation. Recent results have demonstrated that Xist is both necessary and sufficient for X inactivation. Goals for the future are to understand the mechanism of Xist regulation which underlies the establishment of appropriate X inactivation patterns and to determine how Xist RNA participates in the process of propagating inactivation in cis.
BACKGROUND: Fewer than half of the patients with completely resected non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are cured. Since the introduction of adjuvant chemotherapy in 2004, no substantial progress has been made in adjuvant treatment. We aimed to assess the efficacy of the MAGE-A3 cancer immunotherapeutic in surgically resected NSCLC.METHODS: In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we recruited patients aged at least 18 years with completely resected stage IB, II, and IIIA MAGE-A3-positive NSCLC who did or did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy from 443 centres in 34 countries (Europe, the Americas, and Asia Pacific). Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive 13 intramuscular injections of recMAGE-A3 with AS15 immunostimulant (MAGE-A3 immunotherapeutic) or placebo during 27 months. Randomisation and treatment allocation at the investigator site was done centrally via internet with stratification for chemotherapy versus no chemotherapy. Participants, investigators, and those assessing outcomes were masked to group assignment. A minimisation algorithm accounted for the number of chemotherapy cycles received, disease stage, lymph node sampling procedure, performance status score, and lifetime smoking status. The primary endpoint was broken up into three co-primary objectives: disease-free survival in the overall population, the no-chemotherapy population, and patients with a potentially predictive gene signature. The final analyses included the total treated population (all patients who had received at least one treatment dose). This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00480025.FINDINGS: Between Oct 18, 2007, and July 17, 2012, we screened 13 849 patients for MAGE-A3 expression; 12 820 had a valid sample and of these, 4210 (33%) had a MAGE-A3-positive tumour. 2312 of these patients met all eligibility criteria and were randomly assigned to treatment: 1515 received MAGE-A3 and 757 received placebo and 40 were randomly assigned but never started treatment. 784 patients in the MAGE-A3 group also received chemotherapy, as did 392 in the placebo group. Median follow-up was 38·1 months (IQR 27·9-48·4) in the MAGE-A3 group and 39·5 months (27·9-50·4) in the placebo group. In the overall population, median disease-free survival was 60·5 months (95% CI 57·2-not reached) for the MAGE-A3 immunotherapeutic group and 57·9 months (55·7-not reached) for the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR] 1·02, 95% CI 0·89-1·18; p=0·74). Of the patients who did not receive chemotherapy, median disease-free survival was 58·0 months (95% CI 56·6-not reached) in those in the MAGE-A3 group and 56·9 months (44·4-not reached) in the placebo group (HR 0·97, 95% CI 0·80-1·18; p=0·76). Because of the absence of treatment effect, we could not identify a gene signature predictive of clinical benefit to MAGE-A3 immunotherapeutic. The frequency of grade 3 or worse adverse events was similar between treatment groups (246 [16%] of 1515 patients in the MAGE-A3 group and 122 [16%] of 757 in the placebo group). The most frequently reported grade 3 or higher adverse events were infections and infestations (37 [2%] in the MAGE-A3 group and 19 [3%] in the placebo group), vascular disorders (30 [2%] vs 17 [3%]), and neoplasm (benign, malignant, and unspecified (29 [2%] vs 16 [2%]).INTERPRETATION: Adjuvant treatment with the MAGE-A3 immunotherapeutic did not increase disease-free survival compared with placebo in patients with MAGE-A3-positive surgically resected NSCLC. Based on our results, further development of the MAGE-A3 immunotherapeutic for use in NSCLC has been stopped.FUNDING: GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals SA.
Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is characterized by the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome, which is associated with a balanced translocation involving chromosomes 9 and 22 to produce a fusion gene (bcr-abl) that gives rise to a constitutively activated Abl tyrosine kinase. This kinase led to the discovery of several small-molecule inhibitors, imatinib being the first and most successful of these. Resistance to imatinib results in some patients from Abl kinase point mutations. Overcoming imatinib resistance represents one of the biggest challenges facing clinicians in the modern management of CML. In this review, we discuss the current understanding of CML pathophysiology and mechanisms of imatinib resistance and how advancing this knowledge has led to the design of novel therapies in the area of blastic phase CML and Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia with previous imatinib failure.
Current treatment options for epilepsy are inadequate, as too many patients suffer from uncontrolled seizures and from negative side effects of treatment. In addition to these clinical challenges, our scientific understanding of epilepsy is incomplete. Optogenetic and designer receptor technologies provide unprecedented and much needed specificity, allowing for spatial, temporal and cell type-selective modulation of neuronal circuits. Using such tools, it is now possible to begin to address some of the fundamental unanswered questions in epilepsy, to dissect epileptic neuronal circuits and to develop new intervention strategies. Such specificity of intervention also has the potential for direct therapeutic benefits, allowing healthy tissue and network functions to continue unaffected. In this Perspective, we discuss promising uses of these technologies for the study of seizures and epilepsy, as well as potential use of these strategies for clinical therapies.
Clinically, Weaver syndrome is closely related to Sotos syndrome, which is frequently caused by mutations in NSD1. This gene also encodes a histone methyltransferase, in this case with activity against histone H3 lysine 36. NSD1 is mutated in carcinoma of the upper aerodigestive tract (www.sanger.ac.uk/genetics/CGP/cosmic/) and also fuses to NUP98 in acute myeloid leukemia. Looking more widely, whole exome screens in lymphoma, multiple myeloma, renal carcinoma and other malignancies have identified genes encoding diverse histone modifiers as targets of somatic mutation. Strikingly, several of these (e.g. MLL2, EP300, CREBBP, ASXL1) are also mutated in human developmental disorders thus pointing towards a remarkable and unexpected convergence between somatic and germline genetics.
Familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder typically caused by mutations in genes for lipoprotein lipase (LPL), apolipoprotein C-II (Apo-CII), apolipoprotein A-V (Apo-AV), lipase maturation factor 1 (LMF1) and glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored high-density lipoprotein-binding protein 1 (GPI-HBP1). FCS is associated with severe morbidity that includes recurrent pancreatitis and other problems. Effective treatment to reliably prevent complications has been unavailable, so there is a quest to identify novel interventions to achieve sustained triglyceride lowering and prevention of pancreatitis. Apolipoprotein C-III (Apo-CIII) interferes with triglyceride clearance by blocking LPL and alternative pathways. Volanesorsen is an experimental antisense oligonucleotide that inhibits translation of Apo-CIII mRNA, thereby substantially lowering plasma levels of Apo-CIII and triglycerides. It is being developed for treatment of patients with FCS and refractory hypertriglyceridemia. Data from a variety of clinical trials have been very encouraging, with documentation of excellent triglyceride-lowering efficacy, but there have been concerns about the risk of drug-related thrombocytopenia and bleeding that contributed to the recent decision by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to not approve the drug for clinical use. Clinical trials testing the safety and efficacy of volanesorsen are ongoing, so there is hope that the drug ultimately will be approved and available for treatment of high-risk patients with FCS.
X inactivation is associated with chromosome-wide establishment of inactive chromatin. Although this is classically regarded as facultative heterochromatin that is uniform in nature, the exact distribution of associated epigenetic marks is not well defined. Here we have analysed histone modifications in human somatic cells within two selected regions of the X chromosome. Intergenic, coding and promoter regions are segregated into differentially marked chromatin. H3K27me3 is most prominent in intergenic and silenced coding regions, but is associated with some active coding regions as well. Histone H3/H4 acetylation and H3K4me3 are locally enriched at promoter regions but do not necessarily mark continuing transcription. Remarkably, H3K9me3 is predominant in coding regions of active genes, a phenomenon that is not restricted to the X chromosome. These results argue against the exclusiveness of individual marks to heterochromatin or euchromatin, but rather suggest that composite patterns of interdependent or mutually exclusive modifications together signal the gene expression status.
PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Neuroinflammation is an important mediator of the pathogenesis of disease in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Genetic mutations such as C9orf72 have begun to define the numerous cell autonomous pathways that initiate motor neuron injury. Yet, it is the signalling to surrounding glia and peripherally derived immune cells that initiates the noncell autonomous inflammatory process and promotes self-propagating motor neuron cell death. The purpose of this review is to explore the systemic immune/inflammatory contributions to the pathogenesis of ALS: what are the peripheral pro-inflammatory signatures, what initiates their presence and do they represent potential therapeutic targets.RECENT FINDINGS: In ALS, motor neuron cell death is initiated by multiple cell autonomous pathways leading to misfolded proteins, oxidative stress, altered mitochondria, impaired autophagy and altered RNA metabolism, which collectively promote noncell autonomous inflammatory reactivity. The resulting disease is characterized by activated microglia and astrocytes as well as peripherally derived pro-inflammatory innate and adaptive immune cells. In this unrelenting disorder, circulating blood monocytes and natural killer cells are pro-inflammatory. Furthermore, regulatory T lymphocytes are dysfunctional, and pro-inflammatory cytokines and acute phase proteins are elevated.SUMMARY: The collective dysregulation of cells and cytokines in patients with ALS accurately reflect increased disease burdens, more rapid progression rates and reduced survival times, reinforcing the concept of ALS as a disorder with extensive systemic pro-inflammatory responses. These increased systemic pro-inflammatory immune constituents provide potentially meaningful therapeutic targets.
Amblyopia is characterised by decrease in vision in one or both eyes as a result of processing defect in the visual pathways of the brain. It is considered an irreversible process if detected in the adult age group. This study was conducted from July 1 to December 31, 2010, at Shifa Foundation Community Health Centre, Islamabad, to determine if anisometropic amblyopia detected in adults can be reversed. A total of 15 adults, 11 (73.33%) males and 4 (26.66%) females, were managed for anisometropic amblyopia. All the patients were prescribed full cycloplegic correction in the anisometropic eye simultaneously with part-time occlusion therapy. Success was defined as visual acuity of 6/18 or better at the end of the therapy. All patients were required to complete a structured questionnaire regarding their experiences with the therapy. Reversal of amblyopia was observed in 11 (73.33%) patients who felt more confident about performing tasks for which they had earlier considered themselves unsuitable. Poor compliance was responsible for not producing the desired outcome in 4 (26.66%) patients. Anisometropic amblyopia in adults is reversible with dedicated efforts on behalf of both the ophthalmologist and the patient.
The mTOR signaling pathway integrates inputs from a variety of upstream stimuli to regulate diverse cellular processes including proliferation, growth, survival, motility, autophagy, protein synthesis and metabolism. The mTOR pathway is dysregulated in a number of human pathologies including cancer, diabetes, obesity, autoimmune disorders, neurological disease and aging. Ongoing clinical trials testing mTOR-targeted treatments number in the hundreds and underscore its therapeutic potential. To date mTOR inhibitors are clinically approved to prevent organ rejection, to inhibit restenosis after angioplasty, and to treat several advanced cancers. In this review we discuss the continuously evolving field of mTOR pharmacogenomics, as well as highlight the emerging efforts in identifying diagnostic and prognostic markers, including miRNAs, in order to assess successful therapeutic responses.
Dopamine replacement therapy effectively treats the early motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, its association with the development of motor complications limits its usefulness in late stages of the disease. Adenosine A(2A) receptors are localised to the indirect striatal output function and control motor behaviour. They are active in predictive experimental models of PD and appear to be promising as the first major non-dopaminergic therapy for PD. Istradefylline is a novel adenosine A(2A) receptor antagonist currently in Phase III clinical trials for efficacy in patients with PD; results from Phase II clinical trials demonstrated that it provides a clinically meaningful reduction in 'off' time and an increased 'on' time with non-troublesome dyskinesia in levodopa-treated patients with established motor complications, and is safe and well tolerated.
BACKGROUND: Non-invasive prenatal testing of cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) in maternal plasma can predict the fetal RhD type in D negative pregnant women. In Denmark, routine antenatal screening for the fetal RhD gene (RHD) directs the administration of antenatal anti-D prophylaxis only to women who carry an RhD positive fetus. Prophylaxis reduces the risk of immunization that may lead to hemolytic disease of the fetus and the newborn. The reliability of predicting the fetal RhD type depends on pre-analytical factors and assay sensitivity. We evaluated the testing setup in the Capital Region of Denmark, based on data from routine antenatal RHD screening.METHODS: Blood samples were drawn at gestational age 25 weeks. DNA extracted from 1 mL of plasma was analyzed for fetal RHD using a duplex method for exon 7/10. We investigated the effect of blood sample transportation time (n = 110) and ambient outdoor temperatures (n = 1539) on the levels of cffDNA and total DNA. We compared two different quantification methods, the delta Ct method and a universal standard curve. PCR pipetting was compared on two systems (n = 104).RESULTS: The cffDNA level was unaffected by blood sample transportation for up to 9 days and by ambient outdoor temperatures ranging from -10 °C to 28 °C during transport. The universal standard curve was applicable for cffDNA quantification. Identical levels of cffDNA were observed using the two automated PCR pipetting systems. We detected a mean of 100 fetal DNA copies/mL at a median gestational age of 25 weeks (range 10-39, n = 1317).CONCLUSION: The setup for real-time PCR-based, non-invasive prenatal testing of cffDNA in the Capital Region of Denmark is very robust. Our findings regarding the transportation of blood samples demonstrate the high stability of cffDNA. The applicability of a universal standard curve facilitates easy cffDNA quantification.
Four amphipathic drugs, primaquine, propranolol, chlorpromazine and tetracaine, were used to cause endocytosis in glucose-depleted red cells, and the relative reduction of membrane surfaces was measured by the toluidine blue (TB) method. The TB measurements correlated well with the observed electron microscopic alterations. In vitro blood storage studies indicated loss of cell membrane during storage correlated with decreasing uptake of TB by the red cells. Regeneration of cellular ATP with adenosine did not always restore TB uptake by the cells. Loss of red blood cell membrane either by exocytosis or endocytosis may occur during normal in vivo or in vitro ageing, and may be increased in pathological states or by the action of drugs.
BACKGROUND: Epileptogenic glioblastomas are thought to convey a favorable prognosis, either due to early diagnosis or potential antitumor effects of antiepileptic drugs. We investigated the relationship between survival and epilepsy at presentation, early diagnosis, and antiepileptic drug therapy in glioblastoma patients.METHODS: Multivariable Cox regression was applied to survival data of 647 consecutive patients diagnosed with de novo glioblastoma between 2005 and 2013 in order to investigate the association between epilepsy and survival in glioblastoma patients. In addition, we quantified the association between survival and valproic acid (VPA) treatment.RESULTS: Epilepsy correlated positively with survival (HR: 0.75 (95% CI: 0.61-0.92), P < .01). This effect is independent of age, sex, performance status, type of surgery, adjuvant therapy, tumor location, and tumor volume, suggesting that this positive correlation cannot be attributed solely to early diagnosis. For patients who presented with epilepsy, the use of the antiepileptic drug VPA did not associate with survival when compared with patients who did not receive VPA treatment.CONCLUSION: Epilepsy is an independent prognostic factor for longer survival in glioblastoma patients. This prognostic effect is not solely explained by early diagnosis, and survival is not associated with VPA treatment.
Unipolar brush cells are a class of interneurons in the granular layer of the mammalian cerebellum that receives excitatory mossy fiber synaptic input in the form of a giant glutamatergic synapse. Previously, it was shown that the unipolar brush cell axon branches within the granular layer, giving rise to large terminals. Single mossy fiber stimuli evoke a prolonged burst of firing in unipolar brush cells, which would be distributed to postsynaptic targets within the granular layer. Knowledge of the ultrastructure of the unipolar brush cell terminals and of the cellular identity of its postsynaptic targets is required to understand how unipolar brush cells contribute to information processing in the cerebellar circuit. To investigate the unipolar brush cell axon and its targets, unipolar brush cells were patch-clamped in fresh parasagittal slices from rat cerebellar vermis with electrodes filled with Lucifer Yellow and Biocytin, and examined by confocal fluorescence and electron microscopy. Biocytin was localized with diaminobenzidine chromogen or gold-conjugated, silver-intensified avidin. Light microscopic examination revealed a single thin axon emanating from the unipolar brush cell soma that gave rise to 2-3 axon collaterals terminating in mossy fiber-like rosettes in the granular layer, typically within a few hundred microm of the soma. In some cases, axon collaterals crossed the white matter within the same folium before terminating in the adjacent granular layer. Electron microscopic examination of serial ultrathin sections revealed that proximal unipolar brush cell axons and axon collaterals were unmyelinated and devoid of synaptic contacts. However, the rosette-shaped enlargements of each collateral formed the central component of glomeruli where they were surrounded by dendrites of granule cells and/or other unipolar brush cells, with which they formed asymmetric synaptic contacts. A long-latency repetitive burst of polysynaptic activity was observed in granule cells in this cerebellar region following white matter stimulation. The unipolar brush cell axons, therefore, form a system of cortex-intrinsic mossy fibers. The results indicate that synaptic excitation of unipolar brush cells by mossy fibers will drive a large population of granule cells, and thus will contribute a powerful form of distributed excitation within the basic circuit of the cerebellar cortex.
BACKGROUND: Angiogenesis, among other signaling pathways, plays a key-role in sarcoma biology. Regorafenib (RE) has recently been shown to be effective in imatinib and sunitinib-refractory GIST in a phase III trial.METHODS/DESIGN: We are conducting an international trial (France, Austria and Germany) consisting in 4 parallel double-blind placebo-controlled randomized (1/1) phase II trials to assess the activity and safety of RE in doxorubicin-refractory STS (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01900743). Each phase II trial is dedicated to one of the 4 following histological subgroups: liposarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, synovial sarcoma and other sarcoma. Within each randomized trial the following stratification factors will be applied: countries and prior exposure to pazopanib. Key-eligibility criteria are: measurable disease, age ≥18, not > 3 previous systemic treatment lines for metastatic disease, metastatic disease not amenable to surgical resection. The primary endpoint is progression-free survival (PFS) according to central radiological review. Secondary endpoints are: Toxicity (NCI-CTC AE V4.0); time to progression; Growth modulation index in pts receiving RE after randomization; 3 and 6 months PFS-Rates, best response rate and overall survival. Each phase II trial will be separately analyzed. In 3 trials, statistical assumptions are: PFS0 = 1.6 & PFS1 = 4.6 months; 1-sided α = 0.1; β = 0.05 with a total sample size of 192 pts. To take into account the rarity of synovial sarcoma, the statistical assumptions are: PFS0 = 1.6 & PFS1 = 4.6 months; 1-sided α = 0.1; β = 0.2 Tumor assessment is done monthly during the 4 first months, and every 3 months thereafter. After central radiological confirmation of tumor progression, an optional open-label option is offered to eligible patients.DISCUSSION: The design of this trial allows an assessment of regorafenib activity over placebo in four sarcoma strata and might provide evidence for launching a phase III trial. This study includes both integrative and exploratory translational research program. The study is enrolling since June 2013 (TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: EudraCT N°: 2012-005743-24, on the 15(th) February 2012).
CPEB (Cytoplasmic Polyadenylation Element Binding) proteins are a family of four RNA-binding proteins that regulate the translation of maternal mRNAs controlling meiotic cell cycle progression. But CPEBs are not limited to the transcriptionally silent germline; they are also expressed, in various combinations, in somatic cells, yet their role in regulation of mitosis-related gene expression is largely unknown. Deregulation of CPEB1 and CPEB4 have been linked to tumor development. However, a systematic analysis addressing their requirements for the temporal regulation of mitotic gene expression has yet to be performed. This study addresses the requirements of each of the four CPEBs for mitotic phase transitions, with a particular focus on cytoplasmic polyadenylation and translational regulation. We demonstrate that CPEB3 is the only member dispensable for mitotic cell division, whereas the other three members, CPEB1, 2, and 4, are essential to successful mitotic cell division. Thus, CPEB1 is required for prophase entry, CPEB2 for metaphase and CPEB4 for cytokinesis. These three CPEBs have sequential non-redundant functions that promote the phase-specific polyadenylation and translational activation of CPE-regulated transcripts in the mitotic cell cycle.
Septo-optic dysplasia (or de Morsier syndrome) is a congenital disorder characterised by anomalies in cerebral midline structures, optic nerve hypoplasia, and hormonal deficiencies. Diagnosis should be made early, due to the possibility of treating the hormonal disturbances. We describe here a case with decreased visual acuity, one-sided hemianopia, nystagmus und agenesis of the septum pellucidum and discuss the heterogeneous appearance of this syndrome. There are two theories regarding its pathogenesis. The first postulates simultaneous damage to both cerebral structures and optic nerve development around the 6th week of gestation, while the other favours secondary degeneration of optic nerve fibres due to a cerebral lesion.
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease affecting the joints and surrounding tissue. Identification of novel proteins associated with the progression of a disease is a prerequisite for understanding the pathogenesis of RA. The present study was undertaken to identify the potential biomarkers from a less explored biological sample such as synovial fluid (SF) cells which is specific for RA and to analyze their functional aspects using proteomic approach. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) was performed using synovial fluid cells of RA and osteoarthritis (OA) patients, and 7 differentially expressed proteins were identified using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS/MS). Αlpha-Taxilin (α-Taxilin) has been found as one of the novel, significantly up regulated protein in RA. It has been validated in the synovium, synovial fluid (SF), SF cells, and plasma samples by Western blot, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), immunohistochemistry (IHC), and real-time PCR. The identification of autoantibody against α-Taxilin and in silico studies has further helped us to understand its involvement in disease mechanism. The present study will therefore provide knowledge towards the etiology of RA that pave the way for suitable prognostic marker identification along with other clinical parameters.
Saccharomyces cerevisiae can import iron through a high-affinity system consisting of the Ftr1/Fet3-mediated reductive pathway and the siderophore-mediated non-reductive one. Expression of components of the high-affinity system is controlled by the Aft1 transcriptional factor. In this study we show that, upon oxidative stress, Aft1 is transitorily internalized into the nucleus, followed by transcription activation of components of its regulon. In these conditions, the mRNA levels of the genes of the non-reductive pathway become increased, while those of FTR1 and FET3 remain low because of destabilization of the mRNAs. Consequently, the respective protein levels also remain low. Such mRNA destabilization is mediated by the general 5'-3' mRNA decay pathway and is independent of the RNA binding protein Cth2. Yeast cells are hypersensitive to peroxides in growth conditions where only the high-affinity reductive pathway is functional for iron assimilation. On the contrary, peroxide does not affect growth when iron uptake occurs exclusively through the non-reductive pathway. This reinforces the idea that upon oxidative stress S. cerevisiae cells redirect iron assimilation through the non-reductive pathway to minimize oxidative damage by the ferrous ions, which are formed during iron import through the Ftr1/Fet3 complexes.
Animal studies have shown that mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) infusions improve acute kidney injury (AKI) outcomes when administered early after ischemic/reperfusion injury or within 24 hours after cisplatin administration. These findings have spurred several human clinical trials to prevent AKI. However, no specific therapy effectively treats clinically obvious AKI or rescues renal function once advanced injury is established. We investigated if noninvasive image-guided pulsed focused ultrasound (pFUS) could alter the kidney microenvironment to enhance homing of subsequently infused MSC. To examine the efficacy of pFUS-enhanced cell homing in disease, we targeted pFUS to kidneys to enhance MSC homing after cisplatin-induced AKI. We found that pFUS enhanced MSC homing at 1 day post-cisplatin, prior to renal functional deficits, and that enhanced homing improved outcomes of renal function, tubular cell death, and regeneration at 5 days post-cisplatin compared to MSC alone. We then investigated whether pFUS+MSC therapy could rescue established AKI. MSC alone at 3 days post-cisplatin, after renal functional deficits were obvious, significantly improved 7-day survival of animals. Survival was further improved by pFUS and MSC. pFUS prior to MSC injections increased IL-10 production by MSC that homed to kidneys and generated an anti-inflammatory immune cell profile in treated kidneys. This study shows pFUS is a neoadjuvant approach to improve MSC homing to diseased organs. pFUS with MSC better prevents AKI than MSC alone and allows rescue therapy in established AKI, which currently has no meaningful therapeutic options.
BACKGROUND: The association of ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) with disease severity of patients with COVID-19 is still unclear. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate if ACEI/ARB use is associated with the risk of mortality and severe disease in patients with COVID-19.METHODS: We searched all available clinical studies that included patients with confirmed COVID-19 who could be classified into an ACEI/ARB group and a non-ACEI/ARB group up until 4 May 2020. A meta-analysis was performed, and primary outcomes were all-cause mortality and severe disease.RESULTS: ACEI/ARB use did not increase the risk of all-cause mortality both in meta-analysis for 11 studies with 12 601 patients reporting ORs (OR=0.52 (95% CI=0.37 to 0.72), moderate certainty of evidence) and in 2 studies with 8577 patients presenting HRs. For 12 848 patients in 13 studies, ACEI/ARB use was not related to an increased risk of severe disease in COVID-19 (OR=0.68 (95% CI=0.44 to 1.07); I2=95%, low certainty of evidence).CONCLUSIONS: ACEI/ARB therapy was not associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality or severe manifestations in patients with COVID-19. ACEI/ARB therapy can be continued without concern of drug-related worsening in patients with COVID-19.
We report on a 12-year-old patient with Turcot Syndrome (Glioma polyposis). This patient's case deals with the association between a glioblastoma, anaplastic glioma (WHO Grade III) and colonic adenocarcinoma based on familial polyposis coli. Possible etiology and neurosurgical, clinically important characteristics of this rare syndrome, such as the young age of the patient and the relatively long survival time, will be discussed.
Histone methyltransferase (HMT)(1) class enzymes that methylate lysine residues of histones or proteins contain a conserved catalytic core termed the SET domain, which shares sequence homology with an independently described sequence motif, the PR domain. Intact PR or SET sequence is required for tumor suppression functions, but it remains unclear whether it is histone methyltransferase activity that underlies tumor suppression. We now show that tumor suppressor RIZ1 (PRDM2) methylates histone H3 on lysine 9, and this activity is reduced by mutations in the PR domain found in human cancers. Also, S-adenosylhomocysteine or methyl donor deficiency inhibits RIZ1 and other H3 lysine 9 methylation activities. These results support the hypothesis that H3 lysine 9 methylation activities of a PR/SET domain have tumor suppression functions and may underlie carcinogenesis associated with dietary methyl donor deficiency.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether maternal serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] in the first trimester are altered in pregnant women with pre-existing type 2 diabetes, women who subsequently develop gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and women who deliver large for gestational age (LGA) neonates compared with normoglycaemic pregnant women who deliver an appropriate for gestational age (AGA) neonate.DESIGN: Case-control study.SETTING: Antenatal clinic.POPULATION: Singleton pregnancies at 11(+0) -13(+6) weeks, including 50 women with type 2 diabetes, 100 women who subsequently developed GDM, 50 nondiabetic women who subsequently delivered LGA neonates and 1000 nondiabetic controls who delivered AGA neonates.METHODS: Maternal serum total 25(OH)D levels were measured in the four groups of pregnancies. Multiple regression analysis in the controls was used to identify factors among maternal characteristics with a significant contribution to the levels of serum 25(OH)D, so that the values in all cases were expressed as a multiple of the median (MoM) in the controls.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Comparison of MoM 25(OH)D in the four groups.RESULTS: In controls, significant independent contributions to the serum level of 25(OH)D were provided by maternal age, body mass index, smoking status, racial origin and season of sampling. The median and interquartile range (IQR) of serum 25(OH)D in the type 2 diabetes group (1.01; IQR, 0.68-1.47 MoM), GDM group (0.93; IQR, 0.67-1.23 MoM) and LGA group (0.97; IQR, 0.67-1.25 MoM) were not significantly different from those in the controls (0.99; IQR, 0.71-1.33 MoM) (overall P = 0.643).CONCLUSIONS: The first-trimester maternal serum level of 25(OH)D is not altered in women with type 2 diabetes, those who develop GDM or those who deliver LGA neonates.

BACKGROUND: Myeloma cells may secrete factors that affect the function of osteoblasts, osteoclasts, or both.METHODS: We subjected purified plasma cells from the bone marrow of patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma and control subjects to oligonucleotide microarray profiling and biochemical and immunohistochemical analyses to identify molecular determinants of osteolytic lesions.RESULTS: We studied 45 control subjects, 36 patients with multiple myeloma in whom focal lesions of bone could not be detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and 137 patients in whom MRI detected such lesions. Different patterns of expression of 57 of approximately 10,000 genes from purified myeloma cells could be used to distinguish the two groups of patients (P<0.001). Permutation analysis, which adjusts the significance level to account for multiple comparisons in the data sets, showed that 4 of these 57 genes were significantly overexpressed by plasma cells from patients with focal lesions. One of these genes, dickkopf 1 (DKK1), and its corresponding protein (DKK1) were studied in detail because DKK1 is a secreted factor that has been linked to the function of osteoblasts. Immunohistochemical analysis of bone marrow-biopsy specimens showed that only myeloma cells contained detectable DKK1. Elevated DKK1 levels in bone marrow plasma and peripheral blood from patients with multiple myeloma correlated with the gene-expression patterns of DKK1 and were associated with the presence of focal bone lesions. Recombinant human DKK1 or bone marrow serum containing an elevated level of DKK1 inhibited the differentiation of osteoblast precursor cells in vitro.CONCLUSIONS: The production of DKK1, an inhibitor of osteoblast differentiation, by myeloma cells is associated with the presence of lytic bone lesions in patients with multiple myeloma.
Individuals with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) often exhibit delayed motor and cognitive development, including delayed onset of ambulation. Data on age when loss of independent ambulation occurs are well established for DMD; however, age at onset of walking has not been well described. We hypothesize that an effective medication given in early infancy would advance the age when walking is achieved so that it is closer to age-matched norms, and that this discrete event could serve as the primary outcome measure in a clinical trial. This study examined three data sets, Muscular Dystrophy Surveillance, Tracking, and Research Network (MD STARnet); Dutch Natural History Survey (DNHS); and Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy (PPMD). The distribution of onset of ambulation in DMD (mean ± SD) and median age, in months, at the onset of ambulation was 17.3 (±5.5) and 16.0 in MD STARnet, 21.8 (±7.1) and 20.0 in DNHS, and 16.1 (±4.4) and 15 in PPMD. Age of ambulation in these data sets were all significantly later (P <0.001) than the corresponding age for typically developing boys, 12.1 (±1.8). A hypothetical clinical trial study design and power analyses are presented based on these data.
Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a novel, life-threatening hyperinflammatory condition that develops in children a few weeks after infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). This disease has created a diagnostic challenge due to overlap with Kawasaki disease (KD) and KD shock syndrome. The majority of patients with MIS-C present with the involvement of at least four organ systems, and all have evidence of a marked inflammatory state. Most patients show an increase in the level of at least four inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, neutrophil count, ferritin, procalcitonin, fibrinogen, interleukin-6, and triglycerides). Therapy is primarily with immunomodulators, suggesting that the disease is driven by post-infectious immune dysregulation. Most patients, even those with severe cardiovascular involvement, recover without sequelae. Since coronary aneurysms have been reported, echocardiographic follow-up is needed.Further study is needed to create uniform diagnostic criteria, therapy, and follow-up protocols.
Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue specimens comprise a potentially valuable resource for retrospective biomarker discovery studies, and recent work indicates the feasibility of using shotgun proteomics to characterize FFPE tissue proteins. A critical question in the field is whether proteomes characterized in FFPE specimens are equivalent to proteomes in corresponding fresh or frozen tissue specimens. Here we compared shotgun proteomic analyses of frozen and FFPE specimens prepared from the same colon adenoma tissues. Following deparaffinization, rehydration, and tryptic digestion under mild conditions, FFPE specimens corresponding to 200 microg of protein yielded approximately 400 confident protein identifications in a one-dimensional reverse phase liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis. The major difference between frozen and FFPE proteomes was a decrease in the proportions of lysine C-terminal to arginine C-terminal peptides observed, but these differences had little effect on the proteins identified. No covalent peptide modifications attributable to formaldehyde chemistry were detected by analyses of the MS/MS datasets, which suggests that undetected, cross-linked peptides comprise the major class of modifications in FFPE tissues. Fixation of tissue for up to 2 days in neutral buffered formalin did not adversely impact protein identifications. Analysis of archival colon adenoma FFPE specimens indicated equivalent numbers of MS/MS spectral counts and protein group identifications from specimens stored for 1, 3, 5, and 10 years. Combination of peptide isoelectric focusing-based separation with reverse phase LC-MS/MS identified 2554 protein groups in 600 ng of protein from frozen tissue and 2302 protein groups from FFPE tissue with at least two distinct peptide identifications per protein. Analysis of the combined frozen and FFPE data showed a 92% overlap in the protein groups identified. Comparison of gene ontology categories of identified proteins revealed no bias in protein identification based on subcellular localization. Although the status of posttranslational modifications was not examined in this study, archival samples displayed a modest increase in methionine oxidation, from approximately 17% after one year of storage to approximately 25% after 10 years. These data demonstrate the equivalence of proteome inventories obtained from FFPE and frozen tissue specimens and provide support for retrospective proteomic analysis of FFPE tissues for biomarker discovery.

The TRIM37 gene encodes a peroxisomal protein of unknown function. Mutations in TRIM37 underlie mulibrey nanism, a rare autosomal recessively inherited disorder with severe growth failure of prenatal onset, constrictive pericardium, hepatomegaly and characteristic dysmorphic features. Eleven mulibrey nanism-associated mutations have been identified. We here characterised TRIM37 further by mapping the transcription initiation site and promoter region as well as by analysing splice variants. By primer extension analysis, several transcription initiation sites were localised to a region between -246 and -373 relative to the ATG codon for translation initiation. Basal promoter activity was mapped within 600 nucleotides upstream from the translation initiation site using promoter-luciferase reporter constructs. Several alternative splice variants of TRIM37 exist in databases. Most of these predict non-functional protein products, are expressed at low levels and are thus likely to be targets for nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. A novel splice variant, TRIM37b, with an alternative termination codon and 3'untranslated region (UTR) transcribed from an exon 16 kb downstream from exon 24, predicts an identical protein product with the previously identified transcript, TRIM37a. As seen by Northern blot analysis and quantitative real-time PCR, both transcripts are highly expressed in testis, whereas in other tissues TRIM37a is prominent. The 3'UTR of the PPM1E gene in the opposite strand overlaps TRIM37b. These data suggest that TRIM37 expression is regulated by several mechanisms: through nonsense surveillance of non-functional transcripts, as well as through 3'UTR regulatory sequences and/or naturally occurring antisense RNAs especially in testis.
In this study, we have analyzed the melanogenic potential of Schwann cells using in vitro cell cultures of embryonic quail peripheral nerves. It is shown that in Schwann cells, two factors, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13 acetate (TPA) and endothelin 3, trigger a differentiation pathway toward melanocytes, and that Steel factor has no effect on these cells unless treated simultaneously with TPA. In these cultures, TPA induces the expression of c-kit, whereas Steel factor enhances the development of melanocytes. In the assay system we employed, neither neuronal nor catecholaminergic phenotypes were obtained, regardless of various combinations of related factors added to the culture medium. These data support our previous observations indicating the existence of bipotent progenitors that are capable of differentiating into Schwann cells or into melanocytes, and the regulatory role of endothelin 3 on those precursors, as revealed by the clonal culture of neural crest cells.
Impetigo is a superficial, but contagious, bacterial infection of the skin that predominantly affects children and is common in primary care. In UK general practice, around half of the people with impetigo are treated with topical fusidic acid. However, bacterial resistance to this antibacterial drug is increasing. Here we discuss how patients with impetigo should be treated.
BACKGROUND: Experimental data on perioperative chemotherapy (PeCT) indicate that its initiation might be most useful if administered as close as possible to the time of first 'disturbance of the tumour'. Regimens including 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) as continuous infusion are commonly used in the preoperative setting, especially for large tumours and locally advanced disease. We therefore evaluated the role of PeCT with 5-FU as continuous infusion after preoperative chemotherapy (PreCT), covering the surgical phase and acute wound healing period, in patients with breast cancer too large to attempt breast-conserving surgery upon diagnosis.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Breast cancer patients, clinical stages T2-T3, N0-N2, M0, and Ki-67 labelling index >/= 20%, were treated every 3 weeks with a maximum of six courses of vinorelbine 20 mg total dose intravenously (i.v.) on days 1 and 3, cisplatin 60 mg/ m(2) i.v. on day 1 and 5-FU 200 mg/m(2)/day as a continuous infusion (ViFuP regimen). Patients who achieved a clinical and radiological objective remission with PreCT were also treated with perioperative 5-FU that was continued until 30 min before, and restarted immediately after surgery, prolonging infusion until 15 days after surgery.RESULTS: Following preoperative treatment, 39 of 49 evaluable patients [80%; 95% confidence interval (CI) 70% to 90%] had an objective response. Pathological complete remission (pCR) was achieved in 14 (29%) patients. No relevant clinical or haematological toxicity due to PeCT was observed. In 36 patients submitted to PeCT the rate of pCR was 33% (95% CI 18% to 48%). The highest response of the primary tumour to PreCT and PeCT was observed in women with tumours not expressing estrogen and progesterone receptors (pCR 46%; 95% CI 19% to 73%).CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative therapy can be protracted into the surgical (and wound healing) period without significant additional short-term toxicity. Proper selection of patients according to biological features might improve the therapeutic yield of preoperative therapies.
INTRODUCTION: The ability to degrade neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) is reduced in a subset of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). NETs consist of chromatin covered with antimicrobial enzymes and are normally degraded by DNase-I, an enzyme which is known to have reduced activity in SLE. Decreased ability to degrade NETs is associated with disease activity. In the current study we investigated how the ability of serum from SLE patients to degrade NETs varies during the course of SLE as well as what impact this may have for the clinical phenotype of SLE.METHODS: Serum from 69 patients with SLE, included in a prospective study, was taken every 60 days for a median of 784 days. The ability of serum to degrade NETs was determined and associated with clinical parameters occurring before and at the time of sampling, as well as after sampling by using conditional logistic regression.RESULTS: As many as 41% of all patients in the study showed decreased ability to degrade NETs at least once, but with a median of 20% of all time points. Decreased degradation was associated with manifestations of glomerulonephritis as well as low complement levels and elevated levels of antibodies directed against histones and DNA. Furthermore, the odds ratio for the patient to develop alopecia and fever after an episode of decreased NETs degradation was increased by four to five times compared to normal.CONCLUSIONS: Decreased degradation of NETs is associated with clinical manifestations in SLE and may contribute to disease pathogenesis. Potential therapeutics restoring the ability to degrade NETs could be beneficial for certain patients with SLE.
The sedative thalidomide was withdrawn from the market 30 years ago because of its teratogenic and neurotoxic adverse effects. The compound was later discovered to be extremely effective in the treatment of erythema nodosum leprosum, a complication of lepromatous leprosy. This effect is probably due to a direct influence on the immune system, because thalidomide possesses no antibacterial activity. The compound is presently used as an experimental drug in the treatment of a variety of diseases with an autoimmune character, including recurrent aphthosis of nonviral and nonfungal origin in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients. This article reviews the most important chemical and pharmacokinetic properties of thalidomide. The possible mechanisms of the nonsedative effects of thalidomide with respect to the safety of its use in HIV patients are discussed. Because the mechanism of the immunomodulatory effect of thalidomide is unknown, the possibility that the administration of this compound will accelerate the deterioration of the immunological status of HIV patients cannot be excluded. Clinical evidence suggests that thalidomide may aggravate the condition of patients with preexisting peripheral neuropathy. Hypersensitivity reactions to thalidomide may occur more frequently in HIV patients than in other patient groups. Because of the teratogenic activity of thalidomide, reliable contraception must be provided to female patients of childbearing age. Before the introduction of thalidomide therapy to an HIV patient presenting with oral ulcers, a fungal or viral origin of the lesions should be excluded. Thalidomide should not be used in patients with preexisting HIV-related peripheral polyneuropathy, polyradiculopathy or encephalopathy. In patients experiencing a complete remission, the discontinuation of thalidomide treatment and its reintroduction in the case of a relapse are preferable to maintenance therapy.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate prognostic value of pentraxin3 ( PTX3 ) content combining with extravascular lung water index ( EVLWI ) in patients with sepsis.METHODS: A retrospective analysis of complete clinical data of septic patients admitted to Department of Critical Care Medicine of the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University from February 2013 to February 2014 was conducted. These patients were divided into two groups, survival group and death group, according to the outcome on the 28th day. Pulse index continuous cardiac output ( PiCCO ) was used to record the levels of EVLWI on the 1st, 2nd and 3rd day of intensive care unit ( ICU ) admission. The plasma level of PTX3 was measured simultaneously by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ). At the same time, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II ( APACHEII) score and sequential organ failure assessment ( SOFA ) were calculated. Correlation analysis between plasma PTX3 and EVLWI values was performed, receiver operating characteristic curve ( ROC ) was drawn, and the prognostic value of each parameter was assessed finally.RESULTS: A total of 74 septic patients were enrolled, with 41 cases in the survival group and 33 cases in the non-survival group. Blood lactate, APACHEII, SOFA scores in the non-survival group were significantly higher than those of the survival group at ICU admission, and the length of ICU stay was significantly shorter than that of the survival group, while differences of the other clinical characteristics between two groups were not statistically significant. The plasma PTX3 level gradually declined with time in both groups, and plasma PTX3 at 1, 2, 3 days after ICU admission in non-survival group were significantly higher than those in survival group [ PTX3 ( μg/L ) at 1 day: 46.3±10.5 vs. 19.4±6.5, t = -13.486, P = 0.000; 2 days: 34.8±10.7 vs. 17.7±8.4, t = -8.284, P = 0.000; 3 days: 23.9±11.2 vs. 15.6±7.9, t = -5.036, P = 0.000 ]. EVLWI gradually declined in survival group, but increased in death group. EVLWI at 1, 2, 3 days after ICU admission in non-survival group were significantly higher than those in survival group [ EVLWI ( mL/kg ) at 1 day: 12.12±4.31 vs. 10.02±2.87, t = -2.502, P = 0.023; 2 days: 13.67±4.95 vs. 9.08±2.89, t = -5.188, P = 0.000; 3 days: 14.51±5.06 vs. 8.09±2.50, t = -7.126, P = 0.000 ]. PTX3 at 1, 2, 3 days after ICU admission showed a significant positive correlation with EVLWI ( r1 = 0.747, r2 = 0.719, r3 = 0.705, all P = 0.000 ). ROC curve analysis showed that the area under the ROC ( AUC ) of PTX3 at 1 day was 0.845±0.045, at the cut-off point of 23.0 μg/L, PTX3 showed a sensitivity of 84.8%, a specificity of 74.1%, a negative predictive value of 85.81%, and a positive predictive value of 72.42%. AUC of EVLWI at 3 days was 0.838±0.048, at the cut-off point of 10.5 mL/kg, EVLWI showed a sensitivity of 83.9%, a specificity of 82.9%, a negative predictive value of 86.45%, and a positive predictive value of 79.79%. Their sensitivities and specificities were found to be better than APACHEII, SOFA score. AUC of PTX3 combined with EVLWI at 1 day was 0.886±0.038. On the 1st day after ICU admission, with combination of the two indicators, cut-off point was found to be 0.312, a sensitivity of 86.8%, a specificity of 85.4%, a negative predictive value of 88.93%, and a positive predictive value of 82.72%. On the 3rd day after ICU admission, AUC of PTX3 combined with EVLWI was 0.856±0.046, and showed a cut-off of 0.471 for the prognosis of sepsis, a sensitivity of 85.8%, a specificity of 85.4%, a negative predictive value of 87.97%, and a positive predictive value of 82.50%. Compared with other single index, a combination of above mentioned two indexes showed a better sensitivity and specificity.CONCLUSIONS: PTX3 can serve as a novel prognostic indicator at early stage in septic patients. Combined with EVLWI, it shows important value in predicting prognosis of septic patients, and it also provides guidance in treatment of high-risk patients.
BACKGROUND: The Polycomb Group protein EZH2 is implicated in prostate cancer progression. EZH2 promotes prostate cancer cell proliferation and invasiveness. We describe a link between EZH2 function and actin polymerization in prostate cancer cells.METHODS: Nuclear and cytoplasmic EZH2 expression in benign and malignant prostate tissue samples was assessed. An association between EZH2 function and actin polymerization in prostate cancer cells was investigated using siRNA-mediated knock-down of EZH2. Effects of EZH2 knock-down on actin polymerization dynamics were analyzed biochemically using immunoblot analysis of cell lysate fractions, and morphologically using immunocytochemistry.RESULTS: Cytoplasmic EZH2 is expressed at low levels in benign prostate epithelial cells and over-expressed in prostate cancer cells. Cytoplasmic EZH2 expression levels correlate with nuclear EZH2 expression in prostate cancer samples. Knock-down of EZH2 in PC3 prostate cancer cells increases the amount of F-actin polymerization, cell size, and formation of actin-rich filaments.CONCLUSIONS: Cytoplasmic EZH2 is over-expressed in prostate cancer cells. EZH2 function promotes a reduction in the pool of insoluble F-actin in invasive prostate cancer cells. EZH2 may regulate actin polymerization dynamics and thereby promote prostate cancer cell motility and invasiveness.
Interleukin-5 is a Th2 homodimeric cytokine involved in the differentiation, maturation, migration, development, survival, trafficking and effector function of blood and local tissue eosinophils, in addition to basophils and mast cells. The IL-5 receptor (IL-5R) consists of an IL-5-specific α subunit that interacts in conformationally dynamic ways with the receptor's βc subunit, an aggregate of domains it shares with binding sites of IL-3 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. IL-5 and IL-5R drive allergic and inflammatory immune responses characterizing numerous diseases, such as asthma, atopic dermatitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, eosinophilic gastrointestinal diseases, hyper-eosinophilic syndrome, Churg-Strauss syndrome and eosinophilic nasal polyposis. Although corticosteroid therapy is the primary treatment for these diseases, a substantial number of patients exhibit incomplete responses and suffer side-effects. Two monoclonal antibodies have been designed to neutralize IL-5 (mepolizumab and reslizumab). Both antibodies have demonstrated the ability to reduce blood and tissue eosinophil counts. One additional monoclonal antibody, benralizumab (MEDI-563), has been developed to target IL-5R and attenuate eosinophilia through antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. All three monoclonal antibodies are being clinically evaluated. Antisense oligonucleotide technology targeting the common βc IL-5R subunit is also being used therapeutically to inhibit IL-5-mediated effects (TPI ASM8). Small interfering RNA technology has also been used therapeutically to inhibit the expression of IL-5 in animal models. This review summarizes the structural interactions between IL-5 and IL-5R and the functional consequences of such interactions, and describes the pre-clinical and clinical evidence supporting IL-5R as a therapeutic target.
Generalized resistance to thyroid hormone (GRTH) encompasses a heterogeneous group of conditions characterized by reduced responses of target tissues to thyroid hormone due to defects at the site of hormone action. In the majority of patients, GRTH is inherited as a dominant trait associated with mutations in the hormone-binding domain of the thyroid hormone receptor. GRTH serves as a prototype of other resistance syndromes for hormones that act via nuclear receptors.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and tolerability of topiramate for prophylaxis of migraine and cluster headache via a retrospective chart analysis.BACKGROUND: Topiramate has multiple mechanisms of action that could potentially contribute to migraine prophylaxis. We conducted a retrospective chart review to assess the efficacy of topiramate as add-on therapy in patients with transformed migraine or cluster headache, and as first-line therapy in patients with episodic migraine.METHODS: Patients diagnosed with transformed migraine, episodic migraine, or cluster headache, who received topiramate either as add-on therapy or monotherapy were selected via retrospective chart review. Patients had begun topiramate therapy at 25 mg/day for the first week and increased their dosage by 25 mg/week to a maximum of 200 mg/day. Topiramate was used as add-on therapy for patients with transformed migraine and cluster headache, and as a first-line monotherapy in patients with episodic migraine who had no previous prophylactic therapy. The outcome parameters examined included a mean 28-day migraine frequency, migraine severity, number of headache days/month, number of abortive medication tablets/month, patient global evaluation, and the MIDAS scale.RESULTS: One hundred seventy-eight patients (transformed migraine: n = 96; episodic migraine: n = 70; and cluster headache: n = 12) were included in the retrospective analysis. The mean dose of topiramate for all patients was 87.5 mg/day. For patients with transformed migraine, mean migraine frequency decreased from 6.3/28 days to 3.7 (P = 0.005). Mean severity decreased from 7.1 to 3.8 on a 10-point scale, with 10 representing the most severe pain (P = 0.003). The mean number of headache days/month decreased from 22.1 to 9.6 (P = 0.001), and the mean number of abortive medication tablets decreased from 28.7/month to 10.6 (P = 0.001). Patient global evaluation indicated substantial or moderate improvement in 53% of patients with transformed migraine who used topiramate as add-on therapy. Mean MIDAS scale values decreased from 90.2 to 24.9 (P< 0.0001). The 70 episodic migraine patients who were administered topiramate as first-line therapy exhibited a decrease in mean migraine frequency (5.8/28 days to 1.9, P = 0.001), while mean migraine severity decreased from 8.1 to 2.0 (P = 0.003). Sixty-one percent of patients reported marked improvement. Nine of the 12 cluster headache patients exhibited substantial or moderate improvement in symptoms, whereas three had no improvement. The most common adverse effects were paresthesias (12%), cognitive effects (11%), and dizziness (6%). Eight patients discontinued topiramate due to adverse effects; cognitive effects were the most common reason. No patient discontinued topiramate treatment due to lack of efficacy. Twelve percent of patients lost more than 5 lbs during treatment (a range of 5-120 lbs).CONCLUSION: For both patients with transformed migraine (add-on therapy) and patients with episodic migraine (first-line monotherapy), topiramate yielded significant reductions in migraine frequency, migraine severity, number of headache days/month, and use of abortive medications. Topiramate also appears to be well tolerated and useful in the adjunctive treatment of cluster headache. Prospective double-blind, placebo-controlled trials will be required to confirm our results.
Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy affecting North American cervids. Because it is uniformly fatal, the disease is a major concern in the management of white-tailed deer populations. Management programs to control CWD require improved knowledge of deer interaction, movement, and population connectivity that could influence disease transmission and spread. Genetic methods were employed to evaluate connectivity among populations in the CWD management zone of southern Wisconsin. A 576-base-pair region of the mitochondrial DNA of 359 white-tailed deer from 12 sample populations was analyzed. Fifty-eight variable sites were detected within the sequence, defining 43 haplotypes. While most sample populations displayed similar levels of haplotype diversity, individual haplotypes were clustered on the landscape. Spatial clusters of different haplotypes were apparent in distinct ecoregions surrounding CWD outbreak areas. The spatial distribution of mtDNA haplotypes suggests that clustering of the deer matrilineal groups and population connectivity are associated with broad-scale geographic landscape features. These landscape characteristics may also influence the contact rates between groups and therefore the potential spread of CWD; this may be especially true of local disease spread between female social groups. Our results suggest that optimal CWD management needs to be tailored to fit gender-specific dispersal behaviors and regional differences in deer population connectivity. This information will help wildlife managers design surveillance and monitoring efforts based on population interactions and potential deer movement among CWD-affected and unaffected areas.
Three-dimensional pharmacophore models were generated for AT1 and ET(A) receptors based on highly selective AT1 and ET(A) antagonists using the program Catalyst/HipHop. Both the best pharmacophore model for selective AT1 antagonists (Hypo-AT(1)-7) and ETA antagonists (Hypo-ET(A)-1) were obtained through a careful validation process. All five features contained in Hypo-AT(1)-7 and Hypo-ET(A)-1 (hydrogen-bond acceptor (A), hydrophobic aliphatic (Z), negative ionizable (N), ring aromatic (R), and hydrophobic aromatic (Y)) seem to be essential for antagonists in terms of binding activity. Dual AT1 and ET(A) receptor antagonists (DARAs) can map to both Hypo-AT(1)-7 and Hypo-ET(A)-1, separately. Comparison of Hypo-AT(1)-7 and Hypo-ET(A)-1, not only AT1 and ET(A) antagonist pharmacophore models consist of essential features necessary for compounds to be highly active and selective toward their corresponding receptor, but also have something in common. The results in this study will act as a valuable tool for designing and researching structural relationship of novel dual AT1 and ET(A) receptor antagonists.
Peripheral nerves have peculiar energetic requirements because of considerable length of axons and therefore correct mitochondria functioning and distribution along nerves is fundamental. Mitochondrial dynamics refers to the continuous change in size, shape, and position of mitochondria within cells. Abnormalities of mitochondrial dynamics produced by mutations in proteins involved in mitochondrial fusion (mitofusin-2, MFN2), fission (ganglioside-induced differentiation-associated protein-1, GDAP1), and mitochondrial axonal transport usually present with a Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) phenotype. MFN2 mutations cause CMT type 2A by altering mitochondrial fusion and trafficking along the axonal microtubule system. CMT2A is an axonal autosomal dominant CMT type which in most cases is characterized by early onset and rather severe course. GDAP1 mutations also alter fission, fusion and transport of mitochondria and are associated either with recessive demyelinating (CMT4A) and axonal CMT (AR-CMT2K) and, less commonly, with dominant, milder, axonal CMT (CMT2K). OPA1 (Optic Atrophy-1) is involved in fusion of mitochondrial inner membrane, and its heterozygous mutations lead to early-onset and progressive dominant optic atrophy which may be complicated by other neurological symptoms including peripheral neuropathy. Mutations in several proteins fundamental for the axonal transport or forming the axonal cytoskeleton result in peripheral neuropathy, i.e., CMT, distal hereditary motor neuropathy (dHMN) or hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy (HSAN), as well as in hereditary spastic paraplegia. Indeed, mitochondrial transport involves directly or indirectly components of the kinesin superfamily (KIF5A, KIF1A, KIF1B), responsible of anterograde transport, and of the dynein complex and related proteins (DYNC1H1, dynactin, dynamin-2), implicated in retrograde flow. Microtubules, neurofilaments, and chaperones such as heat shock proteins (HSPs) also have a fundamental role in mitochondrial transport and mutations in some of related encoding genes cause peripheral neuropathy (TUBB3, NEFL, HSPB1, HSPB8, HSPB3, DNAJB2). In this review, we address the abnormalities in mitochondrial dynamics and their role in determining CMT disease and related neuropathies.
Gray platelet syndrome (GPS) is an autosomal recessive bleeding disorder that is characterized by large platelets that lack α-granules. Here we show that mutations in NBEAL2 (neurobeachin-like 2), which encodes a BEACH/ARM/WD40 domain protein, cause GPS and that megakaryocytes and platelets from individuals with GPS express a unique combination of NBEAL2 transcripts. Proteomic analysis of sucrose-gradient subcellular fractions of platelets indicated that NBEAL2 localizes to the dense tubular system (endoplasmic reticulum) in platelets.
Aurora-A has been identified as one of the most attractive targets for cancer therapy and a considerable number of Aurora-A inhibitors have been reported recently. In order to clarify the essential structure-activity relationship for the known Aurora-A inhibitors as well as identify new lead compounds against Aurora-A, 3D pharmacophore models were developed based on the known inhibitors. The best hypothesis, Hypo1, was used to screen molecular structural databases, including Specs and China Natural Products Database for potential lead compounds. The hit compounds were subsequently subjected to filtering by Lipinski's rules and docking study to refine the retrieved hits and as a result to reduce the rate of false positive. Finally, 39 compounds were purchased for further in vitro assay against several human tumour cell lines including A549, MCF-7, HepG2 and PC-3, in which Aurora-A is overexpressed. Two compounds show very low micromolar inhibition potency against some of these tumour cells. And they have been selected for further investigation.
Bach1 is a member of the basic leucine zipper transcription factor family, and the Bach1/small Maf heterodimer specifically represses transcriptional activity directed by the Maf recognition element (MARE). Because Bach1 is a repressor of the oxidative stress response, we examined the function(s) of Bach1 in keratinocytes subjected to oxidative stress. Oxidative stress induced by H(2)O(2) led to an increase in MARE activity and expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), an inducible antioxidant defense enzyme. Bach1 depletion by small interfering RNAs or by deletion of Bach1 enhanced HO-1 expression in the absence of H(2)O(2), indicating that Bach1 is a critical repressor of HO-1 in keratinocytes. Although Bach1-deficient or -reduced keratinocytes expressed higher levels of HO-1 than control cells in response to H(2)O(2), Bach1 down-regulation did not attenuate the production of reactive oxygen species by H(2)O(2). In contrast, Bach1 overexpression abolished HO-1 induction by H(2)O(2), which led to increased reactive oxygen species accumulation. HO-1 was induced during keratinocyte differentiation, but MARE activity did not change during differentiation. Furthermore, Bach1 overexpression did not inhibit differentiation-associated induction of HO-1 expression, suggesting that HO-1 induction in differentiation is independent of Bach1. Thus, in response to oxidative stress, Bach1 regulates the oxidation state through the negative control of HO-1 expression prior to terminal keratinocyte differentiation. However, Bach1-mediated repression is negated during keratinocyte differentiation.
BACKGROUND: Loss-of-function mutations in the Kazal-type serine protease inhibitor, LEKTI, encoded by the SPINK5 gene cause the rare autosomal recessive skin disease Netherton syndrome (NS). G1258A polymorphism in SPINK5 may be associated with atopic dermatitis, which shares several clinical features with NS.OBJECTIVES: To determine if the phenotype of NS can be caused by a single null mutation in SPINK5 combined with the homozygous G1258A polymorphism.METHODS: We screened mutations in the gene SPINK5 by direct DNA sequencing and position cloning and examined the expressions of the SPINK5-encoded protein LEKTI and other relevant proteins by immunostaining and immunoblot.RESULTS: We describe here a patient who was clinically diagnosed with NS and carried a single null mutation in SPINK5 combined with the homozygous G1258A polymorphism. SPINK5 mRNA was present at normal levels and LEKTI was expressed in the epidermis. Nonetheless, the putative downstream LEKTI substrates stratum corneum trypsin-like enzyme (SCTE), desmoglein 1 and protein markers of keratinocyte differentiation were expressed abnormally, similar to that seen in NS if two null mutant alleles are present.CONCLUSION: This finding indicates that haploinsufficiency of SPINK5 can cause the NS phenotype in the presence of one null mutation with homozygous G1258A polymorphisms in SPINK5, and this could impair the function of LEKTI and therefore acts as a true mutation.
Despite recent advances in understanding the molecular mechanisms of autism spectrum disorders (ASD), the current treatments for these disorders are mostly focused on behavioral and educational approaches. The considerable clinical and molecular heterogeneity of ASD present a significant challenge to the development of an effective treatment targeting underlying molecular defects. Deficiency of SHANK family genes causing ASD represent an exciting opportunity for developing molecular therapies because of strong genetic evidence for SHANK as causative genes in ASD and the availability of a panel of Shank mutant mouse models. In this article, we review the literature suggesting the potential for developing therapies based on molecular characteristics and discuss several exciting themes that are emerging from studying Shank mutant mice at the molecular level and in terms of synaptic function.
It is well known that the neurologic manifestations of vitamin B12 deficiency can occur in the absence of anemia. The authors recently observed two elderly patients who presented to a chronic care institution with the diagnosis of dementia, and in both individuals low serum B12 levels were found in conjunction with abnormal Schilling tests. In neither of these two patients was there anemia or macrocytosis. After receiving parenteral B12 injections there was improvement noted in cognitive functions as well as in activities of daily living. The authors are reporting these patients to alert clinicians to the fact that pernicious anemia in the elderly can first present with low serum B12 levels and neurologic abnormalities in the absence of anemia or macrocytosis.
The Oca (Oligomeric coiled-coil adhesin) family is a subgroup of the bacterial trimeric autotransporter adhesins, which includes structurally related proteins, such as YadA of Yersinia enterocolitica and NadA of Neisseria meningitidis. In this study, we searched in silico for novel members of this family in bacterial genomes and identified HadA (Haemophilus adhesin A), a trimeric autotransporter expressed only by Haemophilus influenzae biogroup aegyptius causing Brazilian purpuric fever (BPF), a fulminant septicemic disease of children. By comparative genomics and sequence analysis we predicted that the hadA gene is harboured on a mobile genetic element unique to BPF isolates. Biological analysis of HadA in the native background was limited because this organism is not amenable to genetic manipulation. Alternatively, we demonstrated that expression of HadA confers to a non-invasive Escherichia coli strain the ability to adhere to human cells and to extracellular matrix proteins and to induce in vitro bacterial aggregation and microcolony formation. Intriguingly, HadA is predicted to lack the typical N-terminal head domain of Oca proteins generally associated with cellular receptor binding. We propose here a structural model of the HadA coiled-coil stalk and show that the N-terminal region is still responsible of the binding activity and a KGD motif plays a role. Interestingly, HadA promotes bacterial entry into mammalian cells. Our results show a cytoskeleton re-arrangement and an involvement of clathrin in the HadA-mediated internalization. These data give new insights on the structure-function relationship of oligomeric coiled-coil adhesins and suggest a potential role of this protein in the pathogenesis of BPF.
Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a neuropeptide that plays a key role in the pathophysiology of migraine headache. MK-0974 (telcagepant) is a potent and selective antagonist of the human and rhesus CGRP receptors and is currently in Phase III clinical studies for the acute treatment of migraine. The pharmacology of MK-0974 has been studied extensively, but there has not been a thorough characterization of its binding properties. Here, we characterize the binding of a tritiated analog of MK-0974 on human neuroblastoma (SK-N-MC) membranes and rhesus cerebellum. [(3)H]MK-0974 displayed reversible and saturable binding to both SK-N-MC membranes and rhesus cerebellum with a K(D) of 1.9 nM and 1.3 nM, respectively. Agonists and antagonists of the CGRP receptor displaced [(3)H]MK-0974 in a concentration-dependent manner in competition binding experiments. Both CGRP and adrenomedullin demonstrated biphasic competition while MK-0974 and the peptide antagonist CGRP(8-37) displaced [(3)H]MK-0974 in a monophasic fashion. In competitive binding studies with [(3)H]MK-0974 and CGRP, the fraction of high-affinity binding was reduced significantly by incubating the membranes with GTPgammaS. In kinetic binding experiments, the off-rate of [(3)H]MK-0974 was determined to be 0.51 min(-1) with a half-life of 1.3 min. In conclusion, the radioligand [(3)H]MK-0974 has proven to be a useful tool for studying the binding characteristics of MK-0974 and has broadened our understanding of this promising molecule.
Proteins are the primary effectors of function in biology, and thus, complete knowledge of their structure and properties is fundamental to deciphering function in basic and translational research. The chemical diversity of proteins is expressed in their many proteoforms, which result from combinations of genetic polymorphisms, RNA splice variants, and posttranslational modifications. This knowledge is foundational for the biological complexes and networks that control biology yet remains largely unknown. We propose here an ambitious initiative to define the human proteome, that is, to generate a definitive reference set of the proteoforms produced from the genome. Several examples of the power and importance of proteoform-level knowledge in disease-based research are presented along with a call for improved technologies in a two-pronged strategy to the Human Proteoform Project.
Ewing's sarcomas are characterized by recurrent chromosomal translocations expressing EWS-ETS fusion proteins, the most common of which is EWS-FLI.(1-5) EWS-FLI is an oncogenic transcription factor that regulates genes involved in tumorigenesis.(6,7) Because the Ewing's sarcoma cell of origin remains unknown, a variety of model systems have been developed to study EWS-FLI fusions,(8-14) and multiple microarray experiments describing potential EWS-FLI target genes have been reported.(8,10,11,13,15-21) Each model has potential benefits and drawbacks, but a large-scale comparison of these has not been reported. Herein we report a meta-analysis of the genes that are dysregulated by EWS-FLI in Ewing's sarcoma model systems. In general, EWS-FLI gain- and loss-of-function models in human cell types were well correlated to patient-derived tumor samples, while murine models were not. Using frequency analysis of dysregulated genes across multiple model systems, we identified a conserved "core" EWS-FLI transcriptional signature. This signature contained many of the genes known to be involved in the tumorigenic phenotype of Ewing's sarcoma, and also contained genes that have not been previously reported. Comparisons between the core EWS-FLI signature and published mesenchymal stem cell data support the recent assertion that mesenchymal stem cells are likely the Ewing's sarcoma precursor cell.(15) These results demonstrate the utility of using comparative analysis to validate model systems and emphasize the unique potential of this approach to identify both oncogenic and background cell signatures.
Rates of remission were examined in two controlled 12-week studies of sertraline and placebo for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The performance of three scales was evaluated: the self-rated Davidson Trauma Scale (DTS), and two interviewer scales: the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) and Clinical Global Impressions (CGI). Sertraline proved significantly superior to placebo with respect to remission on all three ratings. Rates of remission were very similar for all scales, ranging from 23.1-26.3% for sertraline and 13.9-14.9% for placebo. Traditional thresholds for the CAPS and DTS were tested relative to the CGI and to each other. The CAPS and DTS thresholds of < 20 and < 18 were found to be valid.
Nemaline myopathy (NM) is the most common congenital myopathy and is caused by mutations in various genes including NEB (nebulin), TPM2 (beta-tropomyosin), TPM3 (gamma-tropomyosin), and ACTA1 (skeletal alpha-actin). 20-25% of NM cases carry ACTA1 defects and these particular mutations usually induce substitutions of single residues in the actin protein. Despite increasing clinical and scientific interest, the contractile consequences of these subtle amino acid substitutions remain obscure. To decipher them, in the present study, we originally recorded and analysed the mechanics as well as the X-ray diffraction patterns of human membrane-permeabilized single muscle fibres with a particular peptide substitution in actin, i.e. p.Phe352Ser. Results unravelled an unexpected cascade of molecular and cellular events. During contraction, p.Phe352Ser greatly enhances the strain of individual cross-bridges. Paradoxically, p.Phe352Ser also slightly lowers the number of cross-bridges by altering the rate of myosin head attachment to actin monomers. Overall, at the cell level, these divergent mechanisms conduct to an improved steady-state force production. Such results provide new surprising scientific insights and crucial information for future therapeutic strategies.
Mutations in ribosomal proteins RPS19, RPS24 and RPS17 have been reported in Diamond-Blackfan Anemia (DBA), an autosomal dominant disease characterised by pure red cell aplasia. DBA is the prototype of ribosomapathies: a protein synthesis defect in a tissue with a high cellular turnover is considered the cause of the erythroid progenitor failure. We have created the Diamond-Blackfan Anemia mutation database to curate and record DBA gene mutations, together with their functional consequences and clinical phenotypes. This locus-specific resource is open to future submissions and is available online (http://www.dbagenes.unito.it). It is founded on the Leiden Open (source) Variation Database (LOVD) system and includes data from sequence and structure analysis tools, genomic database resources and published reports. It lists all identified variants and background genomic information. Phenotypic data are accessed by selecting a particular mutation. The database includes 219 unique variants of which 86 are disease-causing mutations. The database will be supplemented with other DBA genes as soon as they are reported and their mutations are identified and it should be of assistance to clinicians and investigators involved in DBA research and care.
Adult-onset autosomal dominant leukodystrophy (ADLD) is a slowly progressive neurological disorder characterized by symmetrical widespread myelin loss in the central nervous system, with a phenotype similar to chronic progressive multiple sclerosis. In this study, we identify a genomic duplication that causes ADLD. Affected individuals carry an extra copy of the gene for the nuclear laminar protein lamin B1, resulting in increased gene dosage in brain tissue from individuals with ADLD. Increased expression of lamin B1 in Drosophila melanogaster resulted in a degenerative phenotype. In addition, an abnormal nuclear morphology was apparent when cultured cells overexpressed this protein. This is the first human disease attributable to mutations in the gene encoding lamin B1. Antibodies to lamin B are found in individuals with autoimmune diseases, and it is also an antigen recognized by a monoclonal antibody raised against plaques from brains of individuals with multiple sclerosis. This raises the possibility that lamin B may be a link to the autoimmune attack that occurs in multiple sclerosis.
We report a patient with severe bilateral leg ulceration that was resistant to treatment. A biopsy confirmed the cause as calciphylaxis. Calciphylaxis refers to a syndrome of calcium deposition in the small and intermediate dermal vasculature which can lead to epidermal ischaemia, ulceration and necrosis. Most cases occur in those with chronic renal failure and secondary hyperparathyroidism. We describe the rare presentation of calciphylaxis in a patient with normal renal function and primary hyperparathyroidism who had many classical features. Unfortunately she developed gangrene, sepsis and died.
We review here some recent data about Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), the housekeeping X-linked gene encoding the first enzyme of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), a NADPH-producing dehydrogenase. This enzyme has been popular among clinicians, biochemists, geneticists and molecular biologists because it is the most common form of red blood cell enzymopathy. G6PD deficient erythrocytes do not generate NADPH in any other way than through the PPP and for this reason they are more susceptible than any other cells to oxidative damage. Moreover, this enzyme has also been of crucial importance in many significant discoveries; indeed, G6PD polymorphisms have been instrumental in studying X-inactivation in the human species, as well as in establishing the clonal nature of certain tumors. G6PD deficiency, generally considered as a mild and benign condition, is significantly disadvantageous in certain environmental conditions like in presence of certain drugs. Nevertheless, G6PD deficiency has been positively selected by malaria, and recent knowledge seems to show that it also confers an advantage against the development of cancer, reduces the risk of coronary diseases and has a beneficial effect in terms of longevity.
Cardiac toxicity is a major adverse effect caused by doxorubicin (DOX) therapy. Many recent studies have shown that DOX toxicity involves generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Although protection or alleviation of DOX toxicity can be achieved by administration of antioxidant vitamins such as ascorbic acid and vitamin E, their cardioprotective effect remains controversial. Thus alternative naturally occurring antioxidants may potentially be candidates for antioxidant therapy. In this study, we investigated the antioxidative and cytoprotective effects of Phyllanthus urinaria (PU) against DOX toxicity using H9c2 cardiac myoblasts. The total antioxidant capacity of PU (1 mg/ml) was 5306.75+/-461.62 FRAP value (microM). DOX IC50 values were used to evaluate the cytoprotective effects of PU ethanolic extract (1 or 10 microg/ml) in comparison with those of ascorbic acid (VIT C, 100 microM) and N-acetylcysteine (NAC, 100 microM). PU treatments (1 or 10 microg/ml) dose dependently caused rightward DOX IC50 shifts of 2.8- and 8.5-fold, respectively while treatments with VIT C and NAC increased DOX IC50 by 3.3- and 4.2-fold, respectively. Additionally, lipid peroxidation and caspase-3 activity were parameters used to evaluate cytoprotective effect. All antioxidants completely inhibited cellular lipid peroxidation and caspase-3 activation induced by DOX (1 microM). Endogenous antioxidant defense such as total glutathione (tGSH), catalase and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was also modulated by the antioxidants. PU treatment alone dose dependently increased tGSH, and this effect was retained in the presence of DOX. Similar effect was observed in the assessment of catalase and SOD enzyme activity. The nuclear factor kappaB (NFkappaB) transcription factor assay demonstrated that all antioxidants significantly inhibited DOX-induced NFkappaB activation. Our results suggest that PU protection against DOX cardiotoxicity was mediated through multiple pathways and this plant may serve as an alternative source of antioxidants for prevention of DOX cardiotoxicity.
Conjugated estrogen/bazedoxifene (CE/BZA) therapy represents a new, progestin-free treatment in the management of postmenopausal health. CE/BZA pairs CE with the selective estrogen receptor modulator, BZA. The rationale for the development of CE/BZA was that BZA, acting primarily as a selective estrogen receptor degrader in uterine and breast tissue, would sufficiently inhibit the proliferative effects of CE on the endometrium. The absence of a progestin would reduce the incidence of uterine bleeding, breast pain and increased breast density associated with progestin-containing hormone therapy. CE/BZA has been evaluated in five multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, and active-controlled Phase III trials known as the SMART trials. CE/BZA has been shown to maintain the established benefits of estrogen therapy for treatment of vasomotor symptoms and prevention of a loss in bone mineral density (bone mass), while minimizing certain estrogenic effects, particularly in the uterine endometrium and breast.
Human adipocytes express high levels of two distinct lipid droplet proteins, fat specific protein 27 (FSP27; also called CIDEC), a member of the CIDE family, and perilipin1 (PLIN1), a member of the PAT family. Both proteins play a role in fat metabolism in adipocytes, but how they interact is not known. Our present study demonstrates that FSP27 and PLIN1 co-localize and interact in cultured human primary adipocytes. We also found that the C-terminal domain of FSP27, aa 120-220, interacts with PLIN1. Individual expression of exogenous FSP27 or PLIN1 increased triglyceride content and decreased glycerol release (a measure of lipolysis), but co-expression of both proteins did not further increase triglyceride content or decrease lipolysis in human adipocytes. However, the combination of PLIN1 and FSP27 increased the average size of lipid droplets or caused the formation of unilocular adipocytes. Our data suggest that FSP27 interacts with PLIN1 to regulate lipid droplet size in human adipocytes in a concerted manner.
BACKGROUND: High risk of recurrence/progression bladder tumours is treated with Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) immunotherapy after complete resection of the tumour. Approximately 75% of these tumours express the uncommon carbohydrate antigen sialyl-Tn (Tn), a surrogate biomarker of tumour aggressiveness. Such changes in the glycosylation of cell-surface proteins influence tumour microenvironment and immune responses that may modulate treatment outcome and the course of disease. The aim of this work is to determine the efficiency of BCG immunotherapy against tumours expressing sTn and sTn-related antigen sialyl-6-T (s6T).METHODS: In a retrospective design, 94 tumours from patients treated with BCG were screened for sTn and s6T expression. In vitro studies were conducted to determine the interaction of BCG with high-grade bladder cancer cell line overexpressing sTn.RESULTS: From the 94 cases evaluated, 36 had recurrence after BCG treatment (38.3%). Treatment outcome was influenced by age over 65 years (HR=2.668; (1.344-5.254); P=0.005), maintenance schedule (HR=0.480; (0.246-0.936); P=0.031) and multifocality (HR=2.065; (1.033-4.126); P=0.040). sTn or s6T expression was associated with BCG response (P=0.024; P<0.0001) and with increased recurrence-free survival (P=0.001). Multivariate analyses showed that sTn and/or s6T were independent predictive markers of recurrence after BCG immunotherapy (HR=0.296; (0.148-0.594); P=0.001). In vitro studies demonstrated higher adhesion and internalisation of the bacillus to cells expressing sTn, promoting cell death.CONCLUSION: s6T is described for the first time in bladder tumours. Our data strongly suggest that BCG immunotherapy is efficient against sTn- and s6T-positive tumours. Furthermore, sTn and s6T expression are independent predictive markers of BCG treatment response and may be useful in the identification of patients who could benefit more from this immunotherapy.
Publisher: Das Nephrotische Syndrom ist gekennzeichnet durch eine definierende Kombination an pathologischen Laborwerten und klinischen Symptomen, d. h. einer so genannten grossen Proteinurie (häufig mehr als 3 – 3,5 g Eiweissausscheidung im Urin pro 24 h), Hypalbuminämie, Ödemen und Hyperlipidämie. Die Ursachen des Nephrotischen Syndroms sind vielfältig und können entweder angeboren oder erworben, chronisch persistierend oder reversibel sein. Die Häufigkeit und Verteilung der Ursachen des Nephrotischen Syndroms unterscheiden sich zwischen Kindes- und Erwachsenenalter. Während im Erwachsenenalter vorrangig von erworbenen Formen ausgegangen wird, finden sich im Kindesalter sehr häufig genetisch determinierte Formen. Allen Erkrankungen, die mit einer nephrotischen Proteinurie einhergehen ist gemeinsam, dass der ursächliche Defekt primär oder sekundär die Fussfortsatzzellen (Podozyten) der Nierenglomerula betrifft. Der vorliegende Übersichtsartikel beschäftigt sich mit der Frage, wann aus heutiger Sicht eine genetische Abklärung beim Vorliegen eines nephrotischen Syndroms sinnvoll ist.
Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune neuromuscular disorder. There are several treatment options, including symptomatic treatment (acetylcholinesterase inhibitors), short-term immunosuppression (corticosteroids), long-term immunosuppression (azathioprine, cyclosporine, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, rituximab, tacrolimus), rapid acting short-term immunomodulation (intravenous immunoglobulin, plasma exchange), and long-term immunomodulation (thymectomy). This review explores in detail these different treatment options. Potential future treatments are also discussed.
Publisher: La quilomicronemia familiar es una condición en que una mutación genética altera la capacidad de metabolizar los triglicéridos que viajan en las lipoproteínas, causando elevación extrema de triglicéridos plasmáticos y complicaciones asociadas. La complicación más frecuente es la pancreatitis, que puede llevar a falla multiorgánica o insuficiencia pancreática. La quilomicronemia familiar también afecta la calidad de vida, las relaciones sociales y el desarrollo profesional. El gen más frecuentemente afectado en la quilomicronemia familiar es el de lipoproteína lipasa-1 (LPL), enzima que hidroliza triglicéridos circulantes para su captación tisular. Mutaciones en genes (como APOC2, APOAV, LMF-1, GPIHBP-1) que codifican para proteínas que regulan la maduración, transporte o polimerización de lipoproteína lipasa-1, también pueden estar involucradas. Sin embargo, en cerca del 30% de los pacientes no se encuentra la variante causal. La quilomicronemia familiar debe sospecharse en casos de hipertrigliceridemia extrema, resistente al tratamiento convencional, o que se acompaña de xantomas eruptivos, lipemia retinalis o dolor abdominal. La disponibilidad de escalas de riesgo y pruebas genéticas deben promover la detección oportuna. La nutrición se basa en una dieta muy baja en grasa con adecuada suplencia de vitaminas liposolubles y ácidos grasos esenciales, además de evitar el consumo de alcohol. Si bien el tratamiento farmacológico incluye fibratos y ácidos grasos omega 3, el enfoque actual privilegia agentes biotecnológicos dirigidos a los defectos moleculares propios de la enfermedad. Ello incluye un oligonucleótido antisentido dirigido contra apoC-III (volanesorsen), un anticuerpo monoclonal contra la proteína similar a angiopoietina tipo 3 (evinacumab), y otros compuestos en desarrollo.
We previously estimated that 42% of patients with severe developmental disorders carry pathogenic de novo mutations in coding sequences. The role of de novo mutations in regulatory elements affecting genes associated with developmental disorders, or other genes, has been essentially unexplored. We identified de novo mutations in three classes of putative regulatory elements in almost 8,000 patients with developmental disorders. Here we show that de novo mutations in highly evolutionarily conserved fetal brain-active elements are significantly and specifically enriched in neurodevelopmental disorders. We identified a significant twofold enrichment of recurrently mutated elements. We estimate that, genome-wide, 1-3% of patients without a diagnostic coding variant carry pathogenic de novo mutations in fetal brain-active regulatory elements and that only 0.15% of all possible mutations within highly conserved fetal brain-active elements cause neurodevelopmental disorders with a dominant mechanism. Our findings represent a robust estimate of the contribution of de novo mutations in regulatory elements to this genetically heterogeneous set of disorders, and emphasize the importance of combining functional and evolutionary evidence to identify regulatory causes of genetic disorders.
BACKGROUND: Obesity represents the second preventable mortality cause worldwide, and is very often associated with type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). The first line treatment is lifestyle modification to weight-loss, but for those who fail to achieve the goal or have difficulty in maintaining achieved results, pharmacological treatment is needed. Few drugs are available today, because of their side effects.OBJECTIVE: We aim to review actual pharmacological management of obese patients, highlighting differences between Food and Drug Administration - and European Medicine Agency-approved molecules, and pointing out self-medications readily obtainable and widely distributed.METHODS: Papers on obesity, weight loss, pharmacotherapy, self- medication and diet-aid products were selected using Medline. Research articles, systematic reviews, clinical trials and meta-analyses were screened.RESULTS: Anti-obesity drugs with central mechanisms, such as phentermine and lorcaserin, are available in USA, but not in Europe. Phentermine/topiramate and naltrexone/bupropion combinations are now available, even though the former is still under investigation from EMA. Orlistat, with peripheral mechanisms, represents the only drug approved for weight reduction in adolescents. Liraglutide has been approved at higher dose for obesity. Anti-obesity drugs, readily obtainable from the internet, include crude-drug products and supplements for which there is often a lack of compliance to national regulatory standards.CONCLUSIONS: Mechanisms of weight loss drugs include the reduction of energy intake or the increase in energy expenditure and sense of satiety as well as the decrease of hunger or the reduction in calories absorption. Few drugs are approved, and differences exist between USA and Europe. Moreover, herbal medicines and supplements often sold on the internet and widely used by obese patients, present a risk of adverse effects.
OBJECTIVE: The presence of deleterious mutations in breast cancer (BRCA)-1 or BRCA-2 gene has a decisive influence on the development of various types of neoplasms, such as breast, ovarian, tubal, and peritoneal cancers. Primary peritoneal cancer is an aggressive malignancy which, due to the absence of a specific screening test, cannot be diagnosed in its early stages. As a risk-reducing option, prophylactic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and mastectomy are often proposed in BRCA gene carriers. The effectiveness of a preventive surgical treatment is, however, unclear in the development of peritoneal cancer.MATERIAL AND METHODS: An extensive electronic search was performed in PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane databases.RESULTS: The total number of patients who underwent prophylactic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy was 1,830, of whom 28 presented with peritoneal cancer (1.53%). The age of the included patients ranged from 48 to 61 years. BRCA-1 was present in 9 out of 28 patients and BRCA-2 in 2 patients, while the type of BRCA was unclear in 17 patients. Salpingo-oophorectomy was performed in 23 out of 28 patients, while oophorectomy was carried out in 5 patients. The interval from initial risk-reducing surgical treatment to the presentation of peritoneal cancer ranged from 12 to 84 months.CONCLUSION: Modification of the follow-up guidelines and increase in healthcare providers' awareness may reduce the risk of peritoneal cancer.
AIMS: This population pharmacokinetic analysis of the investigational oral proteasome inhibitor ixazomib assessed the feasibility of switching from body surface area (BSA)-based to fixed dosing, and the impact of baseline covariates on ixazomib pharmacokinetics.METHODS: Data were pooled from 226 adult patients with multiple myeloma, lymphoma or solid tumours in four phase 1 studies, in which ixazomib dosing (oral/intravenous, once/twice weekly) was based on BSA. Population pharmacokinetic modelling was undertaken using nonmem version 7.2.RESULTS: Ixazomib pharmacokinetics were well described by a three compartment model with first order absorption and linear elimination. Ixazomib was absorbed rapidly (Ka 0.5 h(-1)), with dose- and time-independent pharmacokinetics. Estimated absolute bioavailability and clearance were 60% and 2l h(-1), respectively. Although a small effect of BSA (range 1.3-2.6 m(2)) was observed on the peripheral volume of distribution (V4), reducing the corresponding inter-individual variability by 12.9%, there was no relationship between BSA and ixazomib clearance (the parameter that dictates total systemic exposure following fixed dosing). Consistently, based on simulations (n = 1000), median AUCs (including interquartile range) were similar after BSA-based (2.23 mg m(-2)) and fixed (4 mg) oral dosing with no trend in simulated AUC vs. BSA for fixed dosing (P = 0.42). No other covariates, including creatinine clearance (22-213.7 ml min(-1)) and age (23-86 years), influenced ixazomib pharmacokinetics.CONCLUSIONS: This analysis supports a switch from BSA-based to fixed dosing, without dose modification for mild/moderate renal impairment or age, in future adult studies of ixazomib, simplifying dosing guidance and clinical development.
Ultraconserved elements (UCEs), stretches of DNA that are identical between distantly related species, are enigmatic genomic features whose function is not well understood. First identified and characterized in mammals, UCEs have been proposed to play important roles in gene regulation, RNA processing, and maintaining genome integrity. However, because all of these functions can tolerate some sequence variation, their ultraconserved and ultraselected nature is not explained. We investigated whether there are highly conserved DNA elements without genic function in distantly related plant genomes. We compared the genomes of Arabidopsis thaliana and Vitis vinifera; species that diverged ∼115 million years ago (Mya). We identified 36 highly conserved elements with at least 85% similarity that are longer than 55 bp. Interestingly, these elements exhibit properties similar to mammalian UCEs, such that we named them UCE-like elements (ULEs). ULEs are located in intergenic or intronic regions and are depleted from segmental duplications. Like UCEs, ULEs are under strong purifying selection, suggesting a functional role for these elements. As their mammalian counterparts, ULEs show a sharp drop of A+T content at their borders and are enriched close to genes encoding transcription factors and genes involved in development, the latter showing preferential expression in undifferentiated tissues. By comparing the genomes of Brachypodium distachyon and Oryza sativa, species that diverged ∼50 Mya, we identified a different set of ULEs with similar properties in monocots. The identification of ULEs in plant genomes offers new opportunities to study their possible roles in genome function, integrity, and regulation.
Skin is the most frequent target of drug reactions that are reported, may be because they are easily detected. Most (probably more than 90%) are related to drug hypersensitivity, i.e. an individually tailored, unexpected effect mediated by a drug specific activation of the immune response. The clinical presentation of "drug eruptions" is highly variable, from the most common transient and benign erythema that occurs 6-9 days after the introduction of a new drug in 1 to 3 % of users to the most severe forms, that fortunately affect less than 1/10,000 users. Even though there are some overlapping or unclassifiable cases, it is important for clinicians to recognize and categorize severe cutaneous adverse reactions/SCAR (bullous fixed drug eruptions/bFDE, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis/AGEP, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms/DRESS, Stevens-Johnson syndrome/SJS, toxic epidermal necrolysis/TEN). First they must suspect rapidly that an unusual eruption with high fever and severe constitutional symptoms is caused by a medication and not by an infection. Second they have to look for involvement of organs that differ according to the type of reaction. Third they can determine a prognosis, the mortality rate being virtually 0 for bFDE, 5% for AGEP, 10% for "hypersensitivity syndrome"/DRESS and 25% for SJS or TEN. In addition if some medications are "usual suspects" for all types (e.g. anticonvulsants), some other are more specific of a given pattern (pristinamycine, hydroxychloroquine, diltiazem for AGEP, minocycline for DRESS, anti-infectious sulfonamides, allopurinol for epidermal necrolysis). The "phenotypic" diversity of the final expression drug reactions can be explained by the engagement of a variety of cytokines and inflammatory cells and by regulatory mechanisms. For example, memory cytotoxic T-Cells are key effectors in both localized blisters of bFDE and in extensive blisters of epidermal necrolysis.
Epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS) is characterized by skin blistering due to basal keratinocyte fragility. In one family studied, inheritance of EBS is linked to the gene encoding keratin 14, and a thymine to cytosine mutation in exon 6 of keratin 14 has introduced a proline in the middle of an alpha-helical region. In a second family, inheritance of EBS is linked to loci that map near the keratin 5 gene. These data indicate that abnormalities of either of the components of the keratin intermediate filament heterodipolymer can impair the mechanical stability of these epithelial cells.
Background and Objectives: Belimumab (BEL) is a monoclonal antibody approved for the treatment of active systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) but not for lupus nephritis (LN) and neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus (NPSLE). We aimed to assess BEL's effects on these severe, potentially life-threatening manifestations. Methods: Retrospective observational cohort study using routine clinical data in a case series of patients with SLE receiving BEL. Results: Sixteen patients received BEL therapy for active SLE. Nine were excluded because they had no LN or NPSLE. Six suffered from LN, and one patient had NPSLE. All LN patients received BEL in addition to standard therapy including glucocorticoids, hydroxychloroquine, and mycophenolate mofetil in five cases, and tacrolimus in one case. Three patients with proteinuria >1,000 mg/g creatinine responded well (one complete, two partial renal responses); all other patients had decreasing proteinuria and a reduction in anti-dsDNA levels. The patient with NPSLE who had failed previous therapies had persistent clinical improvement of cutaneous and neuropsychiatric manifestations. There was one mild allergic reaction and one lower respiratory tract infection, but no other adverse events. One patient discontinued therapy due to a lack of improvement in clinical symptoms, another because of clinical remission. Conclusions: In our series, BEL led to a decrease of proteinuria in patients with proteinuria of more than 1,000 mg/g creatinine despite standard of care treatment, and led to a marked clinical improvement in one patient with NPSLE. No adverse events were observed. Routinely administered BEL shows clinical efficacy on non-approved manifestations, but careful patient selection is warranted.
BACKGROUND & AIMS: Recently, the SAVOR TIMI-53 (Saxagliptin Assessment of Vascular Outcomes Recorded in patients with diabetes mellitus--Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction-53) reported a significant increase in the risk of hospitalizations for heart failure in patients treated with saxagliptin in comparison with placebo. Aim of the present meta-analysis is the systematic collection and synthesis of information on treatment-emergent cases of acute heart failure described in randomized clinical trials with DPP4.DATA SOURCES: An extensive Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Database search for "vildagliptin", "sitagliptin", "saxagliptin", "alogliptin", "linagliptin", and "dutogliptin" was performed, collecting all randomized clinical trials on humans up to October 1st, 2013. Studies were included if they satisfied the following criteria: i) randomized trials, ii) duration ≥24 weeks; iii) on type 2 diabetes; iv) comparison of DPP4i with placebo or active drugs. The principal outcome was the effect of DPP4i on the incidence of acute heart failure. A total of 84 eligible trials was identified. The overall risk of acute heart failure was higher in patients treated with DPP4i in comparison with those treated with placebo/active comparators (MH-OR: 1.19[1.03; 1.37]; p = 0.015). When trials with non-cardiovascular outcomes were analysed separately no signal of risk was detectable.CONCLUSION: Available data from RCTs suggest that DPP4i could be associated with an increased risk of heart failure, without any clear evidence of differences among drugs of the class. Although it is plausible that the risk is greater in some sub-populations of patients, current evidence is not yet sufficient to identify susceptible patients.
Intraflagellar transport (IFT) depends on two evolutionarily conserved modules, subcomplexes A (IFT-A) and B (IFT-B), to drive ciliary assembly and maintenance. All six IFT-A components and their motor protein, DYNC2H1, have been linked to human skeletal ciliopathies, including asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy (ATD; also known as Jeune syndrome), Sensenbrenner syndrome, and Mainzer-Saldino syndrome (MZSDS). Conversely, the 14 subunits in the IFT-B module, with the exception of IFT80, have unknown roles in human disease. To identify additional IFT-B components defective in ciliopathies, we independently performed different mutation analyses: candidate-based sequencing of all IFT-B-encoding genes in 1,467 individuals with a nephronophthisis-related ciliopathy or whole-exome resequencing in 63 individuals with ATD. We thereby detected biallelic mutations in the IFT-B-encoding gene IFT172 in 12 families. All affected individuals displayed abnormalities of the thorax and/or long bones, as well as renal, hepatic, or retinal involvement, consistent with the diagnosis of ATD or MZSDS. Additionally, cerebellar aplasia or hypoplasia characteristic of Joubert syndrome was present in 2 out of 12 families. Fibroblasts from affected individuals showed disturbed ciliary composition, suggesting alteration of ciliary transport and signaling. Knockdown of ift172 in zebrafish recapitulated the human phenotype and demonstrated a genetic interaction between ift172 and ift80. In summary, we have identified defects in IFT172 as a cause of complex ATD and MZSDS. Our findings link the group of skeletal ciliopathies to an additional IFT-B component, IFT172, similar to what has been shown for IFT-A.
PURPOSE: To investigate which clinical and angioarchitectural features were associated with the occurrence of intracranial hemorrhage in patients with intracranial dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVFs).MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical and angioarchitectural features of 236 consecutive patients diagnosed with DAVF in our department from April 2009 to November 2013. Two groups of patients, with or without intracranial hemorrhage as clinical presentation at the initial diagnosis, were analysed to identify the differences in clinical and angioarchitectural features in univariate analysis. A multivariate logistic regression model was also developed to assess the independent contribution of the potential risk factors. Associations were considered significant for p<0.05.RESULTS: Fifty-six patients (23.7%) presented with intracranial hemorrhage at the initial diagnosis of DAVF. In univariate analysis, male patients (p = 0.002), patients with medical history of smoking (p<0.001) or alcohol consumption (p = 0.022), and DAVFs located at the tentorium (p = 0.010), frontalbasal (p = 0.007), foramen magnum (p = 0.043) or cerebral convexity (p<0.001) were associated with an increased risk of intracranial hemorrhage. A higher risk of hemorrhagic occurrence was also observed in DAVFs with superficial cortical venous drainage (p<0.001), deep venous drainage (p = 0.003), occluded venous sinus (p<0.032), or higher Borden type (p<0.001). A multivariate logistic regression model showed that intracranial hemorrhage in patients with DAVFs was correlated with higher Borden classification (OR 5.880; 95% CI, 3.370-10.257; p<0.001).CONCLUSION: Venous drainage pattern was the only independent risk factor of intracranial hemorrhage in our patients with intracranial DAVF. The other potential risk factors may be confounding factors in predicting intracranial hemorrhage.
Genome mapping in the dog is in its early stages. Here we illustrate an approach to combined physical and linkage mapping of type 1 anchor (gene) loci in the dog using information on syntenic homology from human and mouse, an interbreed cross/backcross, and a strategy for isolation of dog genomic clones containing both gene-specific sequences and simple sequence repeat polymorphisms. Eleven gene loci from human chromosome 17q (HSA17q) were mapped to the centromeric two-thirds of dog chromosome 9 (CFA9), an acrocentric chromosome of medium size: P4HB, GALK1, TK1, GH1, MYL4, BRCA1, RARA, THRA1, MPO, NF1, and CRYBA1. Eight of these were also positioned on a linkage map spanning 38.6 cM. Based on combined fluorescence in situ hybridization and linkage mapping, the gene order on CFA9 is similar to that of the homologous genes on HSA17q and mouse chromosome 11 (MMU11), but in the dog the gene order is inverted with respect to the centromere. Canine loci, GALK1, TK1, GH1, MYL4, THRA1, and RARA constitute a closely linked group near the centromeric end of CFA9, spanning a genetic distance of only 4.7 cM. Canine NF1 and CRYBA1 lie distally, near the lower border of the Giemsa band adjacent to the distal one-third of CFA9. NF1 and CRYBA1 are loosely linked to the more centromeric group (31.2 cM). No HSA17 genes were found on the telomeric one-third of CFA9. Painting of dog chromosomes with a human whole chromosome 17 probe showed hybridization with only the proximal two-thirds of CFA9, consistent with the conclusion that the distal one-third corresponds to a segment or segments of other human chromosomes. Two loci, GLUT4 and PMP22, located on HSA17p, were mapped by FISH to dog chromosome 5 in a region also identified by the whole human chromosome 17 paint, indicating disruption of HSA17 syntenic homology at the centromere.
Erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) have revolutionized the management of anemia of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Peginesatide is an investigational pegylated, peptide-based, once-monthly ESA for increasing and maintaining hemoglobin (Hb). In phase 2 studies, peginesatide increases and maintains target Hb levels in patients with CKD, both those on hemodialysis and those not on hemodialysis; phase 3 trials have recently been completed. This article discusses unmet needs in the management of anemia of CKD, presents peginesatide attributes, reviews the results of select peginesatide clinical studies, and discusses the potential value of peginesatide as an alternative anemia management option.
Magnolol, a small-molecule hydroxylated biphenol, isolated from the root and stem bark of Magnolia officinalis, has been shown to possess antiproliferative effect on various cancer cell lines. In the current study, we found that magnolol potently inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. Further mechanistic studies revealed that induction of apoptosis is associated with cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase, increased generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), reduced mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), release of cytochrome c (Cyto c) and apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) from mitochondria to cytosol, upregulation of Bax, p21 and p53, and down-regulation of Bcl-2, cyclin B1 and cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1). Our findings indicated that magnolol induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cells via the intrinsic pathway with release of AIF from mitochondrial and G2/M phase arrest pathway. Therefore, magnolol might be a potential lead compound in the therapy of breast cancer.
During DNA virus infections, detection of cytosolic DNA by the cGAS-STING pathway leads to activation of IFN-β. Kaposi's Sarcoma Herpesvirus (KSHV), an oncogenic DNA virus, is the etiological agent of Kaposi's Sarcoma, an endothelial cell (EC)-based tumor. To investigate the role of STING during KSHV infection of primary ECs we identified a primary lymphatic EC sample that is defective for STING activation and we also knocked out STING in blood ECs. Ablation of STING in EC does not increase susceptibility to KSHV latent infection nor does it increase KSHV spread after lytic reactivation indicating STING signaling does not restrict KSHV. In contrast, STING ablation increases Adenovirus spread at low MOI, but STING is dispensable for blocking replication. These experiments reveal that the importance of STING depends on the DNA virus and that STING appears more important for restricting spread to bystander cells than for inhibition of viral replication.
Cyclophilins (CyPs) are a large class of highly conserved ubiquitous peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerases. CyPs have also been identified as being a specific receptor for the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A and are involved in a variety of biological functions. CyPJ is a novel member of the CyP family and human CyPJ (hCyPJ) is the protein encoded by a cyclophilin-like gene from human foetal brain, which shows 50% sequence identity to human cyclophilin A (hCyPA). Recombinant hCyPJ was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified. The three-dimensional structure of hCyPJ has been determined by molecular replacement using the hCyPA structure as the search model and has been refined at 2.6 angstroms resolution. The hCyPJ molecule contains four helices and one beta-barrel composed of eight antiparallel beta-strands. The overall secondary and tertiary structures of hCyPJ are similar to those of hCyPA, but hCyPJ contains an additional disulfide bridge and four segments with conformations that are strikingly different from those of hCyPA. His43 and Gln52 of hCyPJ are expected to be the active sites based on sequence alignment with hCyPA. The hCyPJ structure shows a conserved water molecule close to His43 and Gln52 which appears to support the solvent-assisted mechanism.
Human MED26 was originally purified in the cofactor required for the Sp1 activation complex (CRSP) as a 70-kDa component named CRSP70. This polypeptide was specific to metazoans and the “small” form of the Mediator complex. We report here that a Drosophila melanogaster homologue of MED26 similarly interacts with other components of the core Drosophila Mediator complex but not with the kinase module and is recruited to genes upon activation. Using a null allele of Med26, we show that Med26 is required for organismal viability but not for cell proliferation or survival. Clones lacking Med26 in the wing disc lead to loss of the adult wing margin and reduced expression of genes involved in wing margin formation. Surprisingly, when polytene chromosomes from the salivary gland were examined using antibodies to Med26, it was apparent that a fraction of the protein was associated with the chromocenter, which contains pericentric heterochromatin. This staining colocalizes with heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1). Immunoprecipitation experiments show that Med26 interacts with HP1. The interaction is mediated through the chromoshadow domain of HP1 and through the conserved motif in the carboxy terminus of the Med26 protein. This work is the first characterization of the metazoan-specific Mediator subunit in an animal model.
We identified more than 30 studies on the association between exposure to maternal tobacco smoke during pregnancy and cancer in childhood. We combined their results in meta-analyses based on a random effects model. The results of the meta-analyses suggest a small increase in risk of all neoplasms [relative risk (RR) 1.10; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03-1.19; based on 12 studies], but not of specific neoplasms such as leukemia (RR 1.05; CI, 0.82-1.34; 8 studies) and central nervous system tumors (RR 1.04; CI, 0.92-1. 18; 12 studies). Results for other specific neoplasms were sparse, but the available data did not suggest a strong association for any type of tumor. No clear evidence of dose response was present in the studies that addressed this issue. The results on exposure to maternal tobacco smoke before or after pregnancy are too sparse to allow a conclusion. The results on exposure to paternal tobacco smoke suggest an association with brain tumors (RR 1.22; CI, 1.05-1. 40; based on 10 studies) and lymphomas (RR 2.08; CI, 1.08-3.98; 4 studies). The data are too sparse for the other neoplasms, although the results of a few recent large studies are compatible with a weak carcinogenic effect of paternal smoke. For exposure from either maternal or paternal smoke, bias and confounding cannot yet be ruled out. Further studies are needed to confirm the hypothesis that parental tobacco smoke, from the father in particular, is a risk factor of childhood cancer. Results on the risk of lung cancer in adulthood and childhood passive smoking exposure are available from 11 studies: they do not provide evidence of an increased risk (summary RR 0.91; CI, 0.80-1.05).
Neuromedin U (NMU) is a brain-gut peptide, which peripherally stimulates smooth muscle, increases of blood pressure, alters ion transport in the gut, controls local blood flow, and regulates adrenocortical function. Although intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of NMU is known to decrease food intake and body weight, little is known about its effect on other physiological functions. We examined the effects of i.c.v. administration of NMU on mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), and plasma norepinephrine in conscious rats. Neuromedin U (0.05 and 0.5 nmol) provoked an increase in MAP (93.8 +/- 0.5 to 123.5 +/- 1.7 and 94.7 +/- 0.8 to 132.7 +/- 3.0 mm Hg, respectively) and HR (334.9 +/- 6.0 to 494.1 +/- 6.9 and 346.3 +/- 3.3 to 475.1 +/- 8.9 beats/min, respectively). In contrast, plasma norepinephrine increased only with a high dose of neuromedin U. Intravenously administered NMU (0.5 nmol) elicited a small and short lasting increase in MAP, compared to that by i.c.v. NMU. These results indicate that central neuromedin U regulates sympathetic nervous system activity and affects cardiovascular function.
Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a crucial regulator of energy metabolic homeostasis and thus a major survival factor in a variety of metabolic stresses and also in the aging process. Metabolic syndrome is associated with a low-grade, chronic inflammation, primarily in adipose tissue. A low-level of inflammation is also present in the aging process. There are emerging results indicating that AMPK signaling can inhibit the inflammatory responses induced by the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) system. The NF-κB subunits are not direct phosphorylation targets of AMPK, but the inhibition of NF-κB signaling is mediated by several downstream targets of AMPK, e.g., SIRT1, PGC-1α, p53, and Forkhead box O (FoxO) factors. AMPK signaling seems to enhance energy metabolism while it can repress inflammatory responses linked to chronic stress, e.g., in nutritional overload and during the aging process. AMPK can inhibit endoplasmic reticulum and oxidative stresses which are involved in metabolic disorders and the aging process. Interestingly, many target proteins of AMPK are so-called longevity factors, e.g., SIRT1, p53, and FoxOs, which not only can increase the stress resistance and extend the lifespan of many organisms but also inhibit the inflammatory responses. The activation capacity of AMPK declines in metabolic stress and with aging which could augment the metabolic diseases and accelerate the aging process. We will review the AMPK pathways involved in the inhibition of NF-κB signaling and suppression of inflammation. We also emphasize that the capacity of AMPK to repress inflammatory responses can have a significant impact on both healthspan and lifespan.
BACKGROUND: The genes for the long QT syndrome (LQTS) linked to chromosomes 3 (LQT3) and 7 (LQT2) were identified as SCN5A, the cardiac Na+ channel gene, and as HERG, a K+ channel gene. These findings opened the possibility of attempting gene-specific control of ventricular repolarization. We tested the hypothesis that the QT interval would shorten more in LQT3 than in LQT2 patients in response to mexiletine and also in response to increases in heart rate.METHODS AND RESULTS: Fifteen LQTS patients were studied. Six LQT3 and 7 LQT2 patients were treated with mexiletine, and its effects on QT and QTc were measured. Mexiletine significantly shortened the QT interval among LQT3 patients (QTc from 535 +/- 32 to 445 +/- 31 ms, P < .005) but not among LQT2 patients (QTc from 530 +/- 79 to 503 +/- 60 ms, P = NS). LQT3 patients (n = 7) shortened their QT interval in response to increases in heart rate much more than LQT2 patients (n = 4) and also more than 18 healthy control subjects (9.45 +/- 3.3 versus 3.95 +/- 1.97 and 2.83 +/- 1.33, P < .05; data expressed as percent reduction in QT per 100-ms shortening in RR). Among these patients, there is also a trend for LQT2 patients to have syncope or cardiac arrest under emotional or physical stress and for LQT3 patients to have cardiac events either at rest or during sleep.CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to demonstrate differential responses of LQTS patients to interventions targeted to their specific genetic defect. These findings also suggest that LQT3 patients may be more likely to benefit from Na+ channel blockers and from cardiac pacing because they would be at higher risk of arrhythmia at slow heart rates. Conversely, LQT2 patients may be at higher risk to develop syncope under stressful conditions because of the combined arrhythmogenic effect of catecholamines with the insufficient adaptation of their QT interval when heart rate increases.
The compaction of chromatin that occurs when cells enter mitosis is probably the most iconic process of dividing cells. Mitotic chromosomal compaction or 'condensation' is functionally linked to resolution of chromosomal intertwines, transcriptional shut-off and complete segregation of chromosomes. At present, understanding of the molecular events required to convert interphase chromatin into mitotic chromosomes is limited. Here, we review recent advances in the field, focusing on potential chromosomal compaction mechanisms and their importance to chromosome segregation. We propose a model of how metaphase chromosomes could be shaped based on the enzymatic activities of condensin and topoisomerase II in overwinding and relaxation of the DNA fiber during mitosis. We suggest that condensin overwinding is an important requirement for intertwine resolution by topoisomerase II and, together with the inhibition of transcription, contributes to cytological mitotic chromosome appearance or 'condensation'.
Limited behavioural repertoire impacts quality of life in chronic schizophrenia. We have previously shown that the amount of movement exhibited by patients with schizophrenia is positively correlated with the volume of left anterior cingulate cortex and that this quantity of movement can be increased by modafinil. However, increased movement in itself may be of limited clinical significance. Hence, we sought to analyse the 'structure' of spontaneous movement in patients with schizophrenia and to examine whether the chunking of spontaneous activity has a neuroanatomical basis. 'Actiwatches' were used to record spontaneous motor activity over a 20 hour period in sixteen male patients with schizophrenia. Time-series data were analysed for the number of discrete spontaneous activities, which might indicate a degree of structure to ongoing activity. Subjects underwent a whole-brain structural MRI scan. The 'number of discrete movement epochs' correlated with volumes of regions within bilateral rostro-ventral putamen and temporal poles. These data suggest that in people with schizophrenia the volume of bilateral putamen may influence the complexity of their behaviours, as distinct from the overall amount of behaviour. The results are presented in the context of a large body of previous research examining the role of the basal ganglia in motor and cognitive pattern generation.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate mutation of COL1A1 gene and analyze the relationship between genotype and clinical phenotype in a family with osteogenesis imperfecta (OI).METHODS: The family history of an OI pedigree, along with clinical data, was collected. Blood samples from the proband and his families, as well as 50 normal controls, were collected. Mutation of COL1A1 gene was screened using PCR-high resolution melting (PCR-HRM) and validated by sequencing.RESULTS: PCR HRM method showed an abnormal result in proband COL1A133_34 exons, which Tm was 87.7℃, in contrast to the normal control (wt) Tm of 87.9±0.06℃. There was a significant difference between the proband and the normal control with the standardization curve and the difference curves. DNA sequencing showed that Y9COL1A1 gene exons 33_34 has lost a C base (c.2321delC), which resulted in a frameshift mutation and caused an premature termination codon (UAA) at amino acid 334, i.e., p.Pro774LeufsX334 The father and grandfather of the proband, both suffered from OI, were verified to be heterozygous for the same mutation. The same mutation was not found in 50 normal controls. Database search confirmed this to be a novel mutation. Pedigree analysis suggested that it has an autosomal dominant inheritance. The proband and patients from the family were clinically diagnosed as OI type I.CONCLUSION: The study has identified a novel mutation of COL1A1 gene, c.2321delC. This frameshift mutation has caused a premature stop codon and reduced collagen type synthesis, characterized by a lighter OI clinical phenotype.
CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: POLR3-related leukodystrophy, a hypomyelinating leukodystrophy with specific features on brain MRI, is characterized by varying combinations of four major clinical findings: Neurologic dysfunction, typically predominated by motor dysfunction (progressive cerebellar dysfunction, and to a lesser extent extrapyramidal [i.e., dystonia], pyramidal [i.e., spasticity] and cognitive dysfunctions). Abnormal dentition (delayed dentition, hypodontia, oligodontia, and abnormally placed or shaped teeth). Endocrine abnormalities such as short stature (in ~50% of individuals) with or without growth hormone deficiency, and more commonly, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism manifesting as delayed, arrested, or absent puberty. Ocular abnormality in the form of myopia, typically progressing over several years and becoming severe. POLR3-related leukodystrophy and 4H leukodystrophy are the two recognized terms for five previously described overlapping clinical phenotypes (initially described as distinct entities before their molecular basis was known). These include: Hypomyelination, hypodontia, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (4H syndrome); Ataxia, delayed dentition, and hypomyelination (ADDH); Tremor-ataxia with central hypomyelination (TACH); Leukodystrophy with oligodontia (LO); Hypomyelination with cerebellar atrophy and hypoplasia of the corpus callosum (HCAHC). Age of onset is typically in early childhood but later-onset cases have also been reported. An infant with Wiedemann-Rautenstrauch syndrome (neonatal progeroid syndrome) was recently reported to have pathogenic variants in POLR3A on exome sequencing. Confirmation of this as a very severe form of POLR3-related leukodystrophy awaits replication in other individuals with a clinical diagnosis of Wiedemann-Rautenstrauch syndrome.DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: POLR3-related leukodystrophy is diagnosed by the combination of classic clinical findings, typical brain MRI features, and the presence of biallelic pathogenic variants in POLR3A, POLR3B, or POLR1C.MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Individualized care by a multidisciplinary team including a pediatric neurologist, clinical geneticist, physiotherapist, occupational therapist, speech and language pathologist, neuropsychologist, rehabilitation physician, dentist, endocrinologist, ophthalmologist, ear-nose-and-throat specialist, and primary care physician is recommended. Special caution needs to be taken when managing dysphagia in this disorder as it is known to vary widely, even in a single day. Swallowing difficulties will progress over time and dystonia should be monitored and treated to prevent complications and improve the quality of life.GENETIC COUNSELING: POLR3-related leukodystrophy is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal diagnosis for pregnancies at increased risk are possible if both pathogenic variants in the family are known.
BACKGROUND: Pomegranate seed oil has been shown to protect against diet induced obesity and insulin resistance.OBJECTIVE: To characterize the metabolic effects of punicic acid on high fat diet induced obesity and insulin resistance.DESIGN: High-fat diet or high-fat diet with 1% Pomegranate seed oil (PUA) was fed for 12 weeks to induce obesity and insulin resistance. We assessed body weight and composition (pSABRE DEXA-scan), energy expenditure (Columbus Instruments) and insulin sensitivity at the end of the 12 weeks.RESULTS: PSO intake resulted in a lower body weight, 30.5±2.9 vs 33.8±3.2 g PSO vs HFD respectively, p=0.02, without affecting food intake or energy expenditure. The lower body weight was fully explained by a decreased body fat mass, 3.3±2.3 vs 6.7±2.7 g for PSO and HFD fed mice, respectively, p=0.02. Insulin clamps showed that PSO did not affect liver insulin sensitivity but clearly improved peripheral insulin sensitivity, 164±52% vs 92±24% for PSO and HFD fed mice respectively, p=0.01.CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that dietary PSO ameliorates high-fat diet induced obesity and insulin resistance in mice, independent of changes in food intake or energy expenditure.
PURPOSE: We retrospectively report objective and subjective outcomes in 40 male patients who underwent bone anchored suburethral synthetic sling positioning for stress urinary incontinence due to intrinsic sphincter deficiency.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with stress urinary incontinence due to radical retropubic prostatectomy (32), robot assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (3) and transurethral prostate resection (5) underwent bone anchored suburethral synthetic sling positioning between December 2002 and December 2007. Mean followup was 35.2 months (range 2 to 62). Previous anti-incontinence procedures, radiotherapy and transurethral procedures due to urethral stricture were performed in 5, 11 and 5 patients, respectively. Before and after surgery patients were evaluated by physical examination, urethral cystoscopy, urodynamics, a 1-hour pad test and a quality of life questionnaire. Patients were stratified into 3 groups, including group 1-cured (dry with a pad weight of 0 to 1 gm), group 2-improved (mild to moderate incontinence with a pad weight of 2 to 50 gm) and group 3-failed (patient condition unchanged with a pad weight of greater than 50 gm).RESULTS: At the final followup visit 22 (55%), 5 (12.5%) and 13 patients (32.5%) were cured, improved and failed, respectively. Mean pad weight significantly decreased to 51.3 gm in 54% of cases, while the mean total questionnaire score significantly increased to 72.9 in 65% and abdominal leak point pressure significantly increased to 92.5 cm H(2)O in 52%. Statistical analysis showed a significant association between preoperative radiotherapy and treatment failure (85% of patients). Complications were perineal pain in 73% of cases, detrusor overactivity in 5% and sling infection in 15%.CONCLUSIONS: The bone anchored suburethral synthetic sling is a simple and attractive procedure that can produce immediate good results with low morbidity, especially when strictly selected patients are treated. Radiotherapy remains a strong predictor of failure.
We conducted a review of patient medical records to assess treatment response patterns and prognostic indicators of response among chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients in the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Japan. All 1,063 patients selected met the following inclusion criteria: aged 18 or older and in chronic phase at the time of diagnosis, Philadelphia chromosome and/or BCR-ABL positive, received first-line treatment with imatinib, and not enrolled in a randomized clinical trial during the period of retrospective review. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to evaluate prognostic indicators of complete hematological response (CHR), complete cytogenetic response (CCyR), and complete or major molecular response (C/MMR). Among patients treated with first-line imatinib, CHR at three months, CCyR at 12 months, and C/MMR at 18 months were observed in 53, 53.1, and 57.8 % of patients, respectively. Among patients treated with second-line dasatinib or nilotinib, CHR was achieved at three months in 49 and 42 %, CCyR at 12 months in 32 and 23 %, and MMR at 18 months in 30.5 and 26.1 % of patients, respectively. Prognostic indicators of first-line response included age, race, and Sokal score. For second-line treatment, duration of first-line hematological response and choice of drug used were also significant.
Nitric oxide serves various roles in mammalian cells, including intracellular signaling and cell killing. To recognize the dynamic molecular changes in response to NO, microarray analysis was applied to human fibroblasts (IMR-90) exposed to sublethal levels of NO. Among the > 300 transcripts induced by NO, we focused on the mRNA encoded by the transforming growth factor-beta- (TGF-beta-) inducible early response 1 gene (TIEG1), which plays a pivotal role in TGF-beta-regulated cell growth control and apoptosis. Northern blotting analysis demonstrated that NO upregulates TIEG1 mRNA in a dose-dependent manner. Anti-TGF-beta antibodies prevented TIEG1 mRNA induction by TGF-beta, but not the induction by NO. Conversely, NO had no effect on the amounts of total TGF-beta or its active form in culture supernatants. However, the half-life of the TIEG1 transcript was strongly increased (6-fold) upon exposure of the cells to NO. Thus, NO upregulates TIEG1 mRNA by stabilization independently of TGF-beta. The TIEG1 mRNA now joins heme oxygenase-1 mRNA in displaying regulation by NO-mediated stabilization. It remains to be determined whether the same control mechanism operates on these and perhaps other messages.
Matrix metalloproteinases are involved in leucocyte invasion into the central nervous system (CNS) during meningitis. The aim of the study was to determine whether there are differences in the expression patterns of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with meningitis caused by one of two known distinct viral agents. Concentrations were measured by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in 16 children with mumps meningitis, in 25 children with echovirus type 30 meningitis and in a control group of 23 children without any CNS infection. Increased levels of MMP-9 were found in children with mumps (median 0.48 ng/ml; P < 0.001) and enteroviral meningitis (median 2.76 ng/ml; P < 0.001) compared with that in controls (median: 0.01 ng/ml). Concentrations of TIMP-1 greatly exceeded concentrations of MMP-9 and were elevated in children with mumps (median: 56 ng/ml) and echovirus type 30 meningitis (median: 55 ng/ml) compared to controls (median: 17 ng/ml). No significant differences in MMP-9 or TIMP-1 levels were detected between the two meningitis groups. The MMP-9/TIMP-1 ratio was greater in children with echovirus type 30 than in those with mumps meningitis. There was no correlation between MMP-9 levels and total CSF cell count. MMP-9 correlated with CSF absolute neutrophil count in children with echovirus type 30 meningitis (r = 0.431; P < 0.05). The concentration of MMP-9 is higher in children with viral meningitis, possibly because of infiltrating polymorphonuclear cells present in the initial phase of the disease.
The endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidases (ERAP)1 and ERAP2 play a critical role in the production of final epitopes presented by MHC class I molecules. Formation of heterodimers by ERAP1 and ERAP2 has been proposed to facilitate trimming of epitope precursor peptides, but the effects of dimerization on ERAP function remain unknown. In this study, we produced stabilized ERAP1-ERAP2 heterodimers and found that they produced several mature epitopes more efficiently than a mix of the two enzymes unable to dimerize. Physical interaction with ERAP2 changes basic enzymatic parameters of ERAP1 and improves its substrate-binding affinity. Thus, by bringing the two enzymes in proximity and by producing allosteric effects on ERAP1, dimerization of ERAP1/2 creates complexes with superior peptide-trimming efficacy. Such complexes are likely to enhance Ag presentation by cells displaying coordinated expression of the two enzymes.
BACKGROUND: The role and impact of systemic inflammatory response after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage remain to be elucidated.OBJECTIVE: To assess the time course and correlation of systemic inflammatory parameters with outcome and the occurrence of delayed ischemic neurological deficits (DINDs) after subarachnoid hemorrhage.METHODS: Besides the baseline characteristics, daily interleukin-6 (IL-6), procalcitonin, C-reactive protein levels, and leukocyte counts were prospectively measured until day 14 after subarachnoid hemorrhage. Occurrence of infectious complications and application of therapeutic hypothermia were assessed as confounding factors. The primary end point was outcome after 3 months, assessed by Glasgow outcome scale; the secondary end point was the occurrence of DINDs.RESULTS: During a 3-year period, a total of 138 patients were included. All inflammatory parameters measured were higher in patients with unfavorable outcome (Glasgow outcome scale score, 1-3). After adjustment for confounding factors, elevated IL-6 and leukocyte counts remained significant risk factors for unfavorable outcome. The odds ratio for log IL-6 was 4.07 (95% confidence interval, 1.18 to 14.03; P = .03) and for leukocyte counts was 1.24 (95% confidence interval, 1.06-1.46, P = .008). The analysis of the time course established that IL-6 was the only significantly elevated parameter in the early phase in patients with unfavorable outcome. Higher IL-6 levels in the early phase (days 3-7) were associated with the occurrence of DINDs. The adjusted odds ratio for log IL-6 was 4.03 (95% confidence interval, 1.21-13.40; P = .02).CONCLUSION: Higher IL-6 levels are associated with worse clinical outcome and the occurrence of DINDs. Because IL-6 levels were significantly elevated in the early phase, they might be a useful parameter to monitor.
Expression of Cyp1a1 and its related enzyme activity have long been used as a biomarker for aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) activation and a warning of dioxin-like toxicity. As a result, induction of Cyp1a1 by pharmaceutical drug candidates or environmental contaminants raises significant concern in risk assessment. The current study evaluates the specificity of Cyp1a1 induction as a marker for AhR affinity and activation and provides context to assess the relevancy of AhR activation to risk assessment. In vivo experiments examined the expression of Cyp1a1 and other AhR-regulated genes in liver, kidney, and heart in response to 596 compounds. From this data set, a subset of 147 compounds was then evaluated for their ability to activate or bind to the AhR using a combination of gel shift, reporter gene, and competitive receptor binding assays. Whereas in vivo Cyp1a1 mRNA expression is a sensitive marker for AhR activation, it lacks specificity, because 81 (59%) of 137 compounds were found to significantly induce Cyp1a1 in vivo but were not verified to bind or activate the AhR in vitro. Combining in vivo and in vitro findings, we identified nine AhR agonists, six of which are marketed therapeutics and have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, including leflunomide, flutamide, and nimodipine. These drugs do not produce dioxin-like toxicity in rats or in humans. These data demonstrate that induction of Cyp1a1 is a nonspecific biomarker of direct AhR affinity and activation and lend further support to the hypothesis that Cyp1a1 induction and/or AhR activation is not synonymous with dioxin-like toxicity.
A wide range of phenotypes have been reported in autosomal recessive (AR) Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) patients carrying mutations in the ganglioside-induced differentiation-associated protein 1 (GDAP1) gene, such as axonal, demyelinating, and intermediate forms of AR CMT. There have been very few reports of GDAP1 mutations in autosomal dominant (AD) CMT. Here, we report an AD CMT family with a novel Q218E mutation in the GDAP1 gene. The mutation was located within the well-conserved glutathione S-transferase (GST) core region and co-segregated with the affected members in the pedigree. The affected AD CMT individuals had a later disease onset and much milder phenotypes than the AR CMT patients, and the histopathologic examination revealed both axonal degeneration and demyelination.
INTRODUCTION: Monoclonal antibodies play an important role in the therapy of different autoimmune diseases. With the introduction of natalizumab, the importance of monoclonal antibodies in the therapy of multiple sclerosis (MS) has dramatically increased during the past years.AREAS COVERED: In this review, we will focus on newly approved and emerging antibodies for MS therapy. Based on published original articles and citable meeting abstracts, we will discuss their mode of action as well as data on efficacy and safety.EXPERT OPINION: Natalizumab was a breakthrough in MS therapy. However, side effects of this monoclonal antibody limit its use. The risk/benefit ratios of new biologicals in MS therapy are not yet clear. High-yield process daclizumab might qualify as first-line MS therapy, unless hepatotoxicity becomes a relevant safety concern. Alemtuzumab has been approved for MS therapy in Europe but will be reserved for selected patients with highly active disease due to frequent induction of potentially dangerous secondary autoimmune phenomena. Ocrelizumab will likely also be licensed as a second-line therapy in highly active MS. Neutralizing antibodies to interleukin (IL)-17A and blocking antibodies to leucine rich repeat and Ig domain containing 1 might be the most interesting upcoming new antibodies as both offer a new and pathophysiologically relevant approach in MS therapy.
Warfarin is a commonly used oral anticoagulant with a narrow therapeutic range and large interindividual variability in daily dose. Compared with Caucasians, Chinese are known to require lower doses of warfarin. Differences between Caucasians and Chinese in the allelic frequencies of two genes, CYP2C9 and VKORC1, largely explain the difference in dose requirement. There are other genetic polymorphisms that may further explain the response to warfarin. The VKORC1 genotype is an important determinant of response to warfarin in Chinese, but some genetic variants found in other ethnic groups that have a large effect on warfarin response and dosing are not commonly found in Chinese. Therefore, it is important to recognize and beware of ethnic differences in the pharmacogenetics of the response to warfarin, especially in the design of algorithms to aid dosing in clinical practice.
Thyroid hormones have relevant activity at cardiac and vascular level, by influencing heart rate, myocardial excitability as well as inotropic and lusitropic status, systemic vascular resistance and blood pressure. Moreover, they interact with neuro-hormonal systems such as sympathetic nervous system and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system thus also indirectly influencing cardiovascular function. Due to these effects, both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, either in their overt or subclinical forms, can have an unfavourable impact in the setting of cardiovascular diseases. The aim of this review is to focus on the prognostic consequences of thyroid disorders in heart failure patients. Moreover, the therapeutical approach and the possible beneficial effects of restoring euthyroidism are reviewed.
PURPOSE: Ranolazine is a novel antianginal medication that acts by ameliorating disturbed sodium and calcium homeostasis. By preventing myocyte sodium and calcium overload, ranolazine also have potential beneficial effects on myocardial function. Experimental models support this concept, as do 2 small studies in human participants receiving ranolazine intravenously. We evaluated changes in parameters of left ventricular function in stable angina patients treated with oral ranolazine.METHODS: Twenty-two participants were enrolled with Doppler echocardiography performed at baseline and a mean of 2 months after initiation of treatment.RESULTS: Global left ventricular function, as assessed by the myocardial performance index, was significantly improved on drug therapy (P < .0001). This was due to improvement in both diastolic and systolic parameters. Of 21 patients, 17 reported less angina and 8 patients reported an increase in activity level.CONCLUSIONS: We report improved parameters of left ventricular function in response to ranolazine as used in the clinical setting.
BACKGROUND & AIMS: Celiac disease (CD) patients often complain of symptoms consistent with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). We aimed to assess the prevalence of GERD symptoms at diagnosis and to determine the impact of the gluten-free diet (GFD).METHODS: We evaluated 133 adult CD patients at diagnosis and 70 healthy controls. Fifty-three patients completed questionnaires every 3 months during the first year and more than 4 years after diagnosis. GERD symptoms were evaluated using a subdimension of the Gastrointestinal Symptoms Rating Scale for heartburn and regurgitation domains.RESULTS: At diagnosis, celiac patients had a significantly higher reflux symptom mean score than healthy controls (P < .001). At baseline, 30.1% of CD patients had moderate to severe GERD (score >3) compared with 5.7% of controls (P < .01). Moderate to severe symptoms were significantly associated with the classical clinical presentation of CD (35.0%) compared with atypical/silent cases (15.2%; P < .03). A rapid improvement was evidenced at 3 months after initial treatment with a GFD (P < .0001) with reflux scores comparable to healthy controls from this time point onward.CONCLUSIONS: GERD symptoms are common in classically symptomatic untreated CD patients. The GFD is associated with a rapid and persistent improvement in reflux symptoms that resembles the healthy population.
Many tumor suppressors play an important role in the DNA damage pathway. Zinc finger protein 668 (ZNF668) has recently been identified as one of the potential tumor suppressors in breast cancer, but its function in DNA damage response is unknown. Herein, we report that ZNF668 is a regulator of DNA repair. ZNF668 knockdown impairs cell survival after DNA damage without affecting the ATM/ATR DNA-damage signaling cascade. However, recruitment of repair proteins to DNA lesions is decreased. In response to IR, ZNF668 knockdown reduces Tip60-H2AX interaction and impairs IR-induced histone H2AX hyperacetylation, thus impairing chromatin relaxation. Impaired chromatin relaxation causes decreased recruitment of repair proteins to DNA lesions, defective homologous recombination (HR) repair and impaired cell survival after IR. In addition, ZNF668 knockdown decreased RPA phosphorylation and its recruitment to DNA damage foci in response to UV. In both IR and UV damage responses, chromatin relaxation counteracted the impaired loading of repair proteins and DNA repair defects in ZNF668-deficient U2OS cells, indicating that impeded chromatin accessibility at sites of DNA breaks caused the DNA repair defects observed in the absence of ZNF668. Our findings suggest that ZNF668 is a key molecule that links chromatin relaxation with DNA damage response in DNA repair control.
Acute kidney injury induced by ischemia/reperfusion (IR) is a frequent complication in hospitalized patients. Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonism has shown to be helpful against renal IR consequences; however, the potential benefit of novel nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists such as finerenone has to be further explored. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of finerenone to prevent the acute and chronic consequences of ischemic acute kidney injury. For the acute study (24 hours), 18 rats were divided into sham, bilateral renal ischemia of 25 minutes, and rats that received 3 doses of finerenone at 48, 24, and 1 hour before the ischemia. For the chronic study (4 months), 23 rats were divided into sham, rats that underwent 45 minutes of bilateral ischemia, and rats treated with finerenone at days 2 and 1 and 1 hour before IR. We found that after 24 hours of reperfusion, the untreated IR rats presented kidney dysfunction and tubular injury. Kidney injury molecule-1 and neutrophil gelatinase associated to lipolacin mRNA levels were increased. In contrast, the rats treated with finerenone displayed normal kidney function and significantly lesser tubular injury and kidney injury molecule-1 and neutrophil gelatinase associated to lipolacin levels. After 4 months, the IR rats developed chronic kidney disease, evidenced by kidney dysfunction, increased proteinuria and renal vascular resistance, tubular dilation, extensive tubule-interstitial fibrosis, and an increase in kidney transforming growth factor-β and collagen-I mRNA. The transition from acute kidney injury to chronic kidney disease was fully prevented by finerenone. Altogether, our data show that in the rat, finerenone is able to prevent acute kidney injury induced by IR and the chronic and progressive deterioration of kidney function and structure.
The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway is critical for embryonic development. In adult tissues, Hh signaling is relatively quiescent with the exception of roles in tissue maintenance and repair. Aberrant activation of Hh signaling is implicated in multiple aspects of transformation, including the maintenance of the cancer stem cell (CSC) phenotype. Preclinical studies indicate that CSCs from many tumor types are sensitive to Hh pathway inhibition and that Hh-targeted therapeutics block many aspects of transformation attributed to CSCs, including drug resistance, relapse, and metastasis. However, to date, Hh inhibitors, specifically those targeting Smoothened [such as vismodegib, BMS-833923, saridegib (IPI-926), sonidegib/erismodegib (LDE225), PF-04449913, LY2940680, LEQ 506, and TAK-441], have demonstrated good efficacy as monotherapy in patients with basal cell carcinoma and medulloblastoma, but have shown limited activity in other tumor types. This lack of success is likely due to many factors, including a lack of patient stratification in early trials, cross-talk between Hh and other oncogenic signaling pathways that can modulate therapeutic response, and a limited knowledge of Hh pathway activation mechanisms in CSCs from most tumor types. Here, we discuss Hh signaling mechanisms in the context of human cancer, particularly in the maintenance of the CSC phenotype, and consider new therapeutic strategies that hold the potential to expand considerably the scope and therapeutic efficacy of Hh-directed anticancer therapy.
The protein of the gustavus (gus) gene has a typical SOCS box domain and repeats in the splA and RyR (SPRY) domains. GUS can interact with Vasa and is necessary for the specification of germ cells. We cloned two zebrafish genes, SSB-1 and SSB-4 (SPRY domain SOCS box proteins). Phylogenetic analysis shows that zebrafish SSB-1 and SSB-4 are clustered into clades of SSB-1-like and SSB-4-like genes from other species. RT-PCR analysis of tissues revealed that zebrafish SSB-1 and -4 are expressed in the ovary and testis. We investigated the spatial expression patterns of zebrafish SSB-1 and -4 in embryos from the two-cell stage to 72 h postfertilization (hpf) using whole-mount in situ hybridization. SSB-1 and -4 transcripts were present in all blastomeres during the early embryonic stages, but the genes differ in their expression pattern. SSB-4 mRNA was located in the region of the primordial germ cells in 24 and 72 hpf embryos, but SSB-1 mRNA was not detected at these stages. We hypothesize that SSB-4 plays a role in the early development of germ cells.
The myotoxicity of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine has been known for decades. Limb-girdle weakness due to a vacuolar myopathy may occur occasionally in a dose-dependent manner during the first 24 months on chloroquine. However, we report on a case in which muscular weakness developed after a daily intake of 250 chloroquine phosphate (= 155 mg chloroquine base) for a period of 7 years. Even after long-term and apparently well-tolerated chloroquine treatment, the occurrence of severe side-effects is possible.
Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) is a rare disease characterized by progressive ossification of soft tissues, for which there is no effective treatment. Mutations in the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) type I receptor activin receptor-like kinase 2 (ACVR1/ALK2) are the main cause of FOP. We generated human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) from FOP patients with the ALK2 R206H mutation. The mutant ALK2 gene changed differentiation efficiencies of hiPSCs into FOP bone-forming progenitors: endothelial cells (ECs) and pericytes. ECs from FOP hiPSCs showed reduced expression of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 and could transform into mesenchymal cells through endothelial-mesenchymal transition. Increased mineralization of pericytes from FOP hiPSCs could be partly inhibited by the ALK2 kinase inhibitor LDN-212854. Thus, differentiated FOP hiPSCs recapitulate some aspects of the disease phenotype in vitro, and they could be instrumental in further elucidating underlying mechanisms of FOP and development of therapeutic drug candidates.
The aim of these studies was to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics of elagolix, an oral nonpeptide gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist following oral administration in women with renal or hepatic impairment. Two phase 1 studies were conducted in adult women with normal renal function versus renal impairment (reduced study), and normal hepatic function versus hepatic impairment (full study design). All women received a single dose of elagolix 200 mg (renal) or 150 mg (hepatic). Intensive pharmacokinetic blood samples were collected. Elagolix exposures were comparable in women with normal renal function and those with moderate/severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease. Elagolix exposures also appeared to be similar in women with normal hepatic function and women with mild hepatic impairment. Elagolix area under the curve in women with moderate hepatic impairment and with severe hepatic impairment was approximately 3-fold and 7-fold higher than in women with normal hepatic function. The adverse event incidence was low, with the main events being mild nausea and headache. No dosage adjustment was needed in women with renal impairment or women with mild hepatic impairment. Although an elagolix dose of 150 mg once daily may be used in women with moderate hepatic impairment for up to 6 months, this elagolix dose should not be used in women with severe hepatic impairment.
Complex enzymes with multiple catalytic activities are hypothesized to have evolved from more primitive precursors. Global analysis of the Phytophthora sojae genome using conservative criteria for evaluation of complex proteins identified 273 novel multifunctional proteins that were also conserved in P. ramorum. Each of these proteins contains combinations of protein motifs that are not present in bacterial, plant, animal, or fungal genomes. A subset of these proteins were also identified in the two diatom genomes, but the majority of these proteins have formed after the split between diatoms and oomycetes. Documentation of multiple cases of domain fusions that are common to both oomycetes and diatom genomes lends additional support for the hypothesis that oomycetes and diatoms are monophyletic. Bifunctional proteins that catalyze two steps in a metabolic pathway can be used to infer the interaction of orthologous proteins that exist as separate entities in other genomes. We postulated that the novel multifunctional proteins of oomycetes could function as potential Rosetta Stones to identify interacting proteins of conserved metabolic and regulatory networks in other eukaryotic genomes. However ortholog analysis of each domain within our set of 273 multifunctional proteins against 39 sequenced bacterial and eukaryotic genomes, identified only 18 candidate Rosetta Stone proteins. Thus the majority of multifunctional proteins are not Rosetta Stones, but they may nonetheless be useful in identifying novel metabolic and regulatory networks in oomycetes. Phylogenetic analysis of all the enzymes in three pathways with one or more novel multifunctional proteins was conducted to determine the probable origins of individual enzymes. These analyses revealed multiple examples of horizontal transfer from both bacterial genomes and the photosynthetic endosymbiont in the ancestral genome of Stramenopiles. The complexity of the phylogenetic origins of these metabolic pathways and the paucity of Rosetta Stones relative to the total number of multifunctional proteins suggests that the proteome of oomycetes has few features in common with other Kingdoms.
Metabolic plasticity is an emerging hallmark of cancer, and increased glycolysis is often observed in transformed cells. Small molecule inhibitors that target driver oncogenes can potentially inhibit the glycolytic pathway. Osimertinib (AZD9291) is a novel EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that is potent and selective for sensitising (EGFRm) and T790M resistance mutations. Clinical studies have shown osimertinib to be efficacious in patients with EGFRm/ T790M advanced NSCLC who have progressed after EGFR-TKI treatment. However experience with targeted therapies suggests that acquired resistance may emerge. Thus there is a need to characterize resistance mechanisms and to devise ways to prevent, delay or overcome osimertinib resistance. We show here that osimertinib suppresses glycolysis in parental EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma lines, but has not in osimertinib-resistant cell lines. Critically, we show osimertinib treatment induces a strict dependence on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos), as OxPhos inhibitors significantly delay the long-term development of osimertinib resistance in osimertinib-sensitive lines. Accordingly, growth conditions which promote a less glycolytic phenotype confer a degree of osimertinib resistance. Our data support a model in which the combination of osimertinib and OxPhos inhibitors can delay or prevent resistance in osimertinib-naïve tumour cells, and represents a novel strategy that warrants further pre-clinical investigation.
In a phase 2 trial of once-weekly tirzepatide (1, 5, 10, or 15 mg), dulaglutide (1.5 mg), or placebo, the dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist tirzepatide dose-dependently reduced HbA1c and body weight in patients with type 2 diabetes. In this post hoc analysis, inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and cellular stress biomarkers were measured at baseline, 4, 12, and 26 weeks to evaluate the additional effects of tirzepatide on cardiovascular risk factors. At 26 weeks, tirzepatide 10 and 15 mg decreased YKL-40 (also known as chitinase-3 like-protein-1), intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), leptin, and growth differentiation factor 15 levels versus baseline, and YKL-40 and leptin levels versus placebo and dulaglutide. Tirzepatide 15 mg also decreased ICAM-1 levels versus placebo and dulaglutide, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels versus baseline and placebo, but not dulaglutide. GlycA, interleukin 6, vascular cell adhesion molecule 1, and N-terminal-pro hormone B-type natriuretic peptide levels were not significantly changed in any group. YKL-40, hsCRP, and ICAM-1 levels rapidly decreased within 4 weeks of treatment with tirzepatide 10 and 15 mg, whereas the decrease in leptin levels was more gradual and did not plateau by 26 weeks. In this hypothesis-generating exploratory analysis, tirzepatide decreased several biomarkers that have been associated with cardiovascular risk.
BACKGROUND: The mammalian circadian clock and its associated clock genes are increasingly been recognized as critical components for a number of physiological and disease processes that extend beyond hormone release, thermal regulation, and sleep-wake cycles. New evidence suggests that clinical behavior disruptions that involve prolonged shift work and even space travel may negatively impact circadian rhythm and lead to multi-system disease.METHODS: In light of the significant role circadian rhythm can hold over the body's normal physiology as well as disease processes, we examined and discussed the impact circadian rhythm and clock genes hold over lifespan, neurodegenerative disorders, and tumorigenesis.RESULTS: In experimental models, lifespan is significantly reduced with the introduction of arrhythmic mutants and leads to an increase in oxidative stress exposure. Interestingly, patients with Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease may suffer disease onset or progression as a result of alterations in the DNA methylation of clock genes as well as prolonged pharmacological treatment for these disorders that may lead to impairment of circadian rhythm function. Tumorigenesis also can occur with the loss of a maintained circadian rhythm and lead to an increased risk for nasopharyngeal carcinoma, breast cancer, and metastatic colorectal cancer. Interestingly, the circadian clock system relies upon the regulation of the critical pathways of autophagy, the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK), and silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog 1 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) (SIRT1) as well as proliferative mechanisms that involve the wingless pathway of Wnt/β-catenin pathway to foster cell survival during injury and block tumor cell growth.CONCLUSION: Future targeting of the pathways of autophagy, mTOR, SIRT1, and Wnt that control mammalian circadian rhythm may hold the key for the development of novel and effective therapies against aging- related disorders, neurodegenerative disease, and tumorigenesis.
The triple A syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disease that is characterised by the triad of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH)-resistant adrenal insufficiency, achalasia and alacrima. In most patients, neurological and dermatological abnormalities are associated features. We report on the first Bosnian patient with triple A syndrome. Endocrine investigation confirmed primary adrenal insufficiency at the age of 5.8 years. Two months later, achalasia was diagnosed, and in the presence of alacrima, the patient satisfies the diagnostic criteria of triple A syndrome. In addition, a large number of associated neurological and dermatological features were present in this patient. Moreover, he has dysmorphic facial features, which have not been previously described in triple A syndrome. Triple A syndrome was confirmed by molecular analysis, revealing a nonsense mutation p.W84X in the AAAS gene. The parents are both heterozygous carriers of the mutation. The affected twin brother unfortunately died from hypoglycaemic shock, despite a normal cortisol rise in an ACTH stimulation test. Further, triple A syndrome patients carrying the identical homozygous p.W84X mutation have to be studied to assess a genotype-phenotype relationship for this mutation.
Macrophages, dendritic cells, and neutrophils use phagocytosis to capture and clear off invading pathogens. The process is triggered by the interaction of ligands on the pathogens' surface with specific phagocytic receptors, including immunoglobulin (FcR) and complement C3bi (CR3) receptors (integrin alpha(M)beta2, Mac1) . Localized actin-filament assembly that acts as the driving force for particle engulfment is controlled by Rho-family small GTPases . RhoA regulates CR3-mediated phagocytosis through a mechanism that is still unclear . Mammalian Diaphanous-related (mDia) formins participate in the generation of a diverse set of actin-remodeling events downstream of RhoA , and mDia1 is recruited around fibronectin-coated beads in a RhoA-dependent manner in fibroblasts . Here, we set out to examine whether mDia proteins are involved in CR3-mediated phagocytosis in macrophages. We show that the RhoA effector mDia1 is recruited early during CR3-mediated phagocytosis and colocalizes with polymerized actin in the phagocytic cup. Interfering with mDia activity inhibits CR3-mediated phagocytosis while having no effect on FcR-mediated phagocytosis. These results indicate a new function for mDia proteins in the regulation of actin polymerization during CR3-mediated phagocytosis.
Ustekinumab, a human immunoglobulin G1 kappa (IgG1k) monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity to human interleukin-12 and interleukin-23, has demonstrated efficacy in patients with psoriasis. The objective of this study was to perform exposure-response modeling to increase the understanding of reduction in disease severity following treatment with ustekinumab in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis who participate in two phase III studies (PHOENIX 1 and PHOENIX 2). Patients were randomly assigned to receive ustekinumab 45 mg or 90 mg (n = 1312; 11,624 Psoriasis Area and Severity Index [PASI] scores) or placebo (n = 665; 3278 PASI scores). Disease severity was assessed using PASI scores. A population mechanism-based exposure-response model of ustekinumab using NONMEM was developed using serum ustekinumab concentrations and PASI scores. The pharmacodynamic response effect was the reduction in PASI score. The placebo effect, although minor, was also integrated into the model. None of the covariate factors evaluated (eg, demographics, baseline disease characteristics, comorbidities) significantly contributed to the between-subject variability in the pharmacodynamic parameters. The developed exposure-response model can serve as a basis to support future alternative dosing regimens for ustekinumab in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. A robust exposure-response relationship has been confirmed for ustekinumab in psoriasis.
Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM), also known as dimethyl sulfone and methyl sulfone, is an organic sulfur-containing compound that occurs naturally in a variety of fruits, vegetables, grains, and animals, including humans. In the present study, we demonstrated the anti-inflammatory effects of MSM in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated murine macrophages, RAW264.7 cells. MSM significantly inhibited the release of nitric oxide and prostaglandin E(2) by alleviating the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. Furthermore, the levels of interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha were decreased by MSM treatment in cell culture supernatants. Further study indicated that the translocation of the p65 subunit of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB to the nucleus was inhibited by MSM treatment in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells, in which it helped block degradation of inhibitor of NF-kappaB. In addition, in vivo studies demonstrated that topical administration of MSM at 500-1250 microg/ear resulted in similar inhibitory activities in 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate-induced mouse ear edema. Collectively, theses results indicate that MSM inhibits LPS-induced release of pro-inflammatory mediators in murine macrophages through downregulation of NF-kappaB signaling.
The small molecule drug omecamtiv mecarbil (OM) specifically targets cardiac muscle myosin and is known to enhance cardiac muscle performance, yet its impact on human cardiac myosin motor function is unclear. We expressed and purified human β-cardiac myosin subfragment 1 (M2β-S1) containing a C-terminal Avi tag. We demonstrate that the maximum actin-activated ATPase activity of M2β-S1 is slowed more than 4-fold in the presence of OM, whereas the actin concentration required for half-maximal ATPase was reduced dramatically (30-fold). We find OM does not change the overall actin affinity. Transient kinetic experiments suggest that there are two kinetic pathways in the presence of OM. The dominant pathway results in a slow transition between actomyosin·ADP states and increases the time myosin is strongly bound to actin. However, OM also traps a population of myosin heads in a weak actin affinity state with slow product release. We demonstrate that OM can reduce the actin sliding velocity more than 100-fold in the in vitro motility assay. The ionic strength dependence of in vitro motility suggests the inhibition may be at least partially due to drag forces from weakly attached myosin heads. OM causes an increase in duty ratio examined in the motility assay. Experiments with permeabilized human myocardium demonstrate that OM increases calcium sensitivity and slows force development (ktr) in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas the maximally activated force is unchanged. We propose that OM increases the myosin duty ratio, which results in enhanced calcium sensitivity but slower force development in human myocardium.
Arginine vasotocin (VT), and its mammalian homologue arginine vasopressin (VP), are neuropeptides involved in the regulation of social behaviors and stress responsiveness. Previous research has demonstrated opposing effects of VT/VP on aggression in different species. However, these divergent effects were obtained in different social contexts, leading to the hypothesis that different populations of VT/VP neurons regulate behaviors in a context-dependent manner. We here use VP antagonists to block endogenous VT function in male zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) within a semi-natural, mixed-sex colony setting. We examine the role of VT in the regulation of aggression and courtship, and in pair bond formation and maintenance, over the course of three days. Although our results confirm previous findings, in that antagonist treatment reduces aggressive mate competition during an initial behavioral session during which males encounter novel females, we find that the treatment effects are completely reversed within hours of colony establishment, and the antagonist treatment instead facilitates aggression in later sessions. This reversal occurs as aggression shifts from mate competition to nest defense, but is not causally associated with pairing status per se. Instead, we hypothesize that these divergent effects reflect context-specific activation of hypothalamic and amygdalar VT neurons that exert opposing influences on aggression. Across contexts, effects were highly specific to aggression and the antagonist treatment clearly failed to alter latency to pair bond formation, pair bond stability, and courtship. However, VT may still potentially influence these behaviors via promiscuous oxytocin-like receptors, which are widely distributed in the zebra finch brain.
Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is evidence of immunological control of tuberculosis. Dormancy survival regulator (DosR) regulon-encoded proteins may have a role in the maintenance of LTBI. T cell responses to Rv1733c, Rv0081, Rv1735c, and Rv1737c DosR regulon-encoded proteins were found to be most frequent among household contacts of TB cases from Uganda compared to other DosR proteins, but antibody responses were not described. We characterized antibody responses to these proteins in individuals from Uganda. Antibodies to Rv1733c, Rv0081, Rv1735c, and Rv1737c DosR regulon-encoded proteins were measured in 68 uninfected individuals, 62 with LTBI, and 107 with active pulmonary tuberculosis (APTB) cases. There were no differences in the concentrations of antibodies to Rv0081, Rv1735c, and Rv1737c DosR regulon-encoded proteins between individuals with LTBI and APTB and those who were uninfected. LTBI was associated with higher concentrations of antibodies to Rv1733c in female participants [adjusted geometric mean ratio: 1.812, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.105 2.973, and p = 0.019] but not in males (p value for interaction = 0.060). Antibodies to the four DosR regulon-encoded proteins investigated may not serve as good biomarkers of LTBI in the general population. More of the M.tb proteome needs to be screened to identify proteins that induce strong antibody responses in LTBI.
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common disabling neurological disease in young adults characterized by recurrent relapses and / or progression that are attributable to multifocal inflammation, demyelination and axonal pathology within the central nervous system. Currently approved disease-modifying treatments achieve their effects primarily by blocking the proinflammatory response in a nonspecific manner. Their limited clinical efficacy urges a more differentiated and specific therapeutic approach. Advances in understanding the pathophysiology of MS and appreciation of the contribution of neurodegenerative processes to disease pathology have led to promising therapeutic approaches at different points along the MS disease pathway: (i) monoclonal antibody therapy has provided the opportunity to rationally direct the therapeutic intervention by specifically targeting mechanisms of the immune system such as CD52 (alemtuzumab), CD25 (daclizumab), VLA-4 (natalizumab) and CD20 (rituximab); (ii) novel oral immunomodulating agents have shown to prevent lymphocyte recirculation from lymphoid organs such as fingolimod (FTY720); (iii) blocking of intracellular signaling cascades or ion channels at the cell-surface can protect axons from degeneration and restore axonal function in experimental settings; (iv) neuroprotective agents and stem cell therapy are able to promote remyelination and axonal regeneration in vitro. Despite the tremendous efforts undertaken, a better understanding of the sequential evolution of the MS lesion and the development of clinical surrogate markers, which allow to define subsets of patients with different forms of underlying pathogenesis, is necessary. This will pave the way for an optimized treatment approach, which will likely need both to target inflammation and to focus on promotion of neuroprotection and repair.
Diphtheria toxin (tox) and its regulatory element (dtxR) from 72 Corynebacterium diphtheriae strains isolated in Russia and Ukraine before and during the current diphtheria epidemic were studied by PCR-single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis (PCR-SSCP). Twelve sets of primers were constructed (eight for tox and four for dtxR), and three regions within tox and all four regions of dtxR showed significant variations in the number and/or sizes of the amplicons. Two to four different SSCP patterns were identified in each of the variable regions; subsequently, tox and dtxR could be classified into 6 and 12 different types, respectively. The great majority of epidemic strains from both Russia and Ukraine had tox types 3 and 4, and only in a single preepidemic strain isolated in Russia were all eight tox regions identical to those of C. diphtheriae Park-Williams No. 8 (tox type 1). Epidemic strains from Ukraine can easily be identified by dtxR type 5, while the majority of the Russian epidemic strains have dtxR of types 2 and 8. No differences in the tox regions between mitis and gravis biotype strains were observed. However, dtxR types 2, 5, and 8 were identified only in the gravis biotype, and dtxR type 1 was characteristic for the mitis biotype strains. PCR-SSCP is a simple and rapid method for the identification of variable tox and dtxR regions that allows for the clear association of tox and dtxR types with strains of distinct temporal and/or geographic origins.
Prior studies have suggested a common etiology involved in Tourette's syndrome and several comorbid conditions and symptomatology. Reportedly, current medications used in Tourette's syndrome have intolerable side-effects or are ineffective for many patients. After thoroughly researching the literature, I hypothesize that magnesium deficiency may be the central precipitating event and common pathway for the subsequent biochemical effects on substance P, kynurenine, NMDA receptors, and vitamin B6 that may result in the symptomatology of Tourette's syndrome and several reported comorbid conditions. These comorbid conditions and symptomatology include allergy, asthma, autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, coprolalia, copropraxia, anxiety, depression, restless leg syndrome, migraine, self-injurious behavior, autoimmunity, rage, bruxism, seizure, heart arrhythmia, heightened sensitivity to sensory stimuli, and an exaggerated startle response. Common possible environmental and genetic factors are discussed, as well as biochemical mechanisms. Clinical studies to determine the medical efficacy for a comprehensive magnesium treatment option for Tourette's syndrome need to be conducted to make this relatively safe, low side-effect treatment option available to doctors and their patients.
BACKGROUND: An increase in the incidence of intraoperative aortic dissection has been reported recently, attributed to the increasingly elderly patient population undergoing cardiac surgery and more off-pump coronary artery bypass. We performed this study to examine current trends, identify risk factors for iatrogenic dissection, and compare iatrogenic intraoperative aortic dissection with spontaneous aortic dissection.METHODS: The 15,144 consecutive patients who underwent cardiac surgery from April 1999 to April 2011 were studied retrospectively on data collected prospectively.RESULTS: Iatrogenic type A aortic dissection following cardiac surgery was diagnosed intraoperatively in 7 (0.04%) patients. Of the 4784 patients who had off-pump coronary artery bypass, only 2 (0.04%) developed iatrogenic intraoperative aortic dissection. Patients in the iatrogenic aortic dissection group were older by a decade (median age 72 vs. 62 years, p = 0.01). The cannulation site in conventional coronary artery bypass grafting and injury by the side-biting clamp in off-pump coronary artery bypass were the most common causes of dissection. Atheromatous disease was identified at the site of cannulation in 5 (71.4%) of the 7 cases.CONCLUSIONS: Intraoperative aortic dissection remains a rare and unpredictable complication of cardiac surgery, with worse outcomes than spontaneous aortic dissection. Increased age and atheromatous disease at the site of cannulation are significant risk factors for iatrogenic dissection. In this series, off-pump coronary artery bypass did not appear to be a risk factor for iatrogenic aortic dissection.
In growing cells, apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites generated spontaneously or resulting from the enzymatic elimination of oxidized bases must be processed by AP endonucleases before they compromise cell integrity. Here, we investigated how AP sites and the processing of these noncoding lesions by the AP endonucleases Nfo, ExoA, and Nth contribute to the production of mutations (hisC952, metB5, and leuC427) in starved cells of the Bacillus subtilis YB955 strain. Interestingly, cells from this strain that were deficient for Nfo, ExoA, and Nth accumulated a greater amount of AP sites in the stationary phase than during exponential growth. Moreover, under growth-limiting conditions, the triple nfo exoA nth knockout strain significantly increased the amounts of adaptive his, met, and leu revertants produced by the B. subtilis YB955 parental strain. Of note, the number of stationary-phase-associated reversions in the his, met, and leu alleles produced by the nfo exoA nth strain was significantly decreased following disruption of polX. In contrast, during growth, the reversion rates in the three alleles tested were significantly increased in cells of the nfo exoA nth knockout strain deficient for polymerase X (PolX). Therefore, we postulate that adaptive mutations in B. subtilis can be generated through a novel mechanism mediated by error-prone processing of AP sites accumulated in the stationary phase by the PolX DNA polymerase.
INTRODUCTION: Metastatic melanoma is an aggressive disease resistant to chemotherapy. Recent clinical trials have reported improved survival for two novel agents; ipilimumab, a humanized, IgG1 monoclonal antibody that blocks cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and vemurafenib , a BRAF (v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1) inhibitor targeting an activating mutation in the serine-threonine-protein kinase BRAF gene.AREAS COVERED: The authors reviewed preclinical and clinical data examining the safety of vemurafenib in melanoma. MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched using the medical subject heading 'vemurafenib' and the following text terms: melanoma, BRAF inhibition, vemurafenib. This review provides the reader with an overview of current data examining the efficacy and safety of vemurafenib in metastatic melanoma.EXPERT OPINION: Vemurafenib is an oral agent licensed for patients with BRAF V600E mutation-positive inoperable and metastatic melanoma. The most common adverse effects observed in Phase III clinical trials were dermatological events, arthralgia and fatigue. Specific dermatological toxicities included development of cutaneous squamous cell cancers and keratoacanthomas. Prolongation of the QT interval was also reported. Regular dermatological assessments and electrocardiograms are recommended. Ongoing trials are examining vemurafenib in both the adjuvant setting and metastatic setting in combination with ipilimumab and MEK inhibitors (mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase). Understanding and overcoming mechanisms of resistance to BRAF inhibitors is the focus of ongoing research.
Repression of excessive increase and enlargement of adipocytes that is closely associated with obesity is effective in the prevention and treatment of metabolic syndrome. Generally, apoptosis is induced in cells via a wide variety of intracellular or extracellular substances, and recently, it has been suggested that the FoxO subfamily is involved in the induction of apoptosis. We aimed to elucidate the mechanism of FoxO-mediated apoptosis-induction in the adipocytes under the reactive oxygen species (ROS) stimulus. The treatment of differentiated and undifferentiated 3T3-L1 cells with glucose oxidase (GOD), an enzyme that generates H(2)O(2), induced apoptosis and led to the accumulation of 8-OHdG. Apoptosis analysis revealed that GOD treatment induced apoptosis in differentiated 3T3-L1 cells less efficiently than in undifferentiated preadipocytes. GOD remarkably increased the levels of Bad, Bax, and Bim-the genes that are actively involved in cell apoptosis. GOD treatment also increased the expression of FoxO3a mRNA and protein. The introduction of FoxO3a-siRNA into 3T3-L1 cells suppressed the oxidative stress-induced expression of Bim mRNA, as well as the GOD-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, the expression of MnSOD, Cu/ZnSOD, and catalase, as well as of FoxO, increased significantly along with the progression of adipocyte differentiation. These results indicated that ROS-induced apoptosis in undifferentiated 3T3-L1 cells via the expression of FoxO3a, whereas FoxO expression suppressed the ROS-induced apoptosis in differentiated 3T3-L1 cells via the expression of ROS-scavenging enzymes.
Although most medicines have historically been small molecules, many newly approved drugs are derived from proteins. Protein therapies have been developed for treatment of diseases in almost every organ system, including the heart. Great excitement has now arisen in the field of regenerative medicine, particularly for cardiac regeneration after myocardial infarction. Every year, millions of people suffer from acute myocardial infarction, but the adult mammalian myocardium has limited regeneration potential. Regeneration of the heart after myocardium infarction is therefore an exciting target for protein therapeutics. In this review, we discuss different classes of proteins that have therapeutic potential to regenerate the heart after myocardial infarction. Protein candidates have been described that induce angiogenesis, including fibroblast growth factors and vascular endothelial growth factors, although thus far clinical development has been disappointing. Chemotactic factors that attract stem cells, e.g., hepatocyte growth factor and stromal cell-derived factor-1, may also be useful. Finally, neuregulins and periostin are proteins that induce cell-cycle reentry of cardiomyocytes, and growth factors like IGF-1 can induce growth and differentiation of stem cells. As our knowledge of the biology of regenerative processes and the role of specific proteins in these processes increases, the use of proteins as regenerative drugs could develop as a cardiac therapy.
The effects on growth, body composition, and metabolism of a protein-restricted diet supplemented with essential aminoacids, the calcium-ketoacids of valine, leucine, isoleucine, and phenylalanine, and the calcium-hydroxyacid of methionine, were investigated in seven growth-retarded children with chronic renal failure. During 0.4 to 1.0 years of treatment there were significant increases in growth velocity and upper arm circumference SD scores, body cell mass (intracellular water calculated as tritium space minus corrected sodium bromide space) and serum transferrin. Blood urea and urea:creatinine ratio fell in all children. Renal function assessed from plasma creatinine and 51Cr EDTA clearance did not change significantly. During treatment there was an increase in plasma calcium, high levels necessitating brief interruption of therapy in two children, and a decrease in plasma phosphate. Levels of serum parathormone fell in all children, and were correlated inversely with plasma calcium and positively with plasma phosphate. Abnormalities compared to control children in blood aminoacid and branched-chain ketoacid levels were unaffected by treatment. These results suggest that a protein-restricted diet supplemented with essential aminoacids and calcium-keto and hydroxyacids may be useful to improve linear growth and nutritional status in children with chronic renal failure, and that a reduction in hyperparathyroidism may be partly responsible for some of the beneficial effects observed.
The hepatic expression of the cell death-inducing DNA fragmentation factor A-like effector family (CIDEA, CIDEB, and CIDEC) genes is markedly upregulated in mouse models of obesity. We evaluated the expression of CIDE genes in liver of obese human subjects undergoing gastric bypass surgery (GBS), at the time of surgery and again 1 year later when subjects had lost 37.6 +/- 1.4% of their initial body weight. At the time of GBS, the expression of CIDEA (r(2) = 0.20, P = 0.04) and CIDEC (r(2) = 0.32, P = 0.01) was strongly correlated with BMI, whereas CIDEB was not (r(2) = 0.01, P = 0.81). One year after surgery, CIDEC expression had declined over 60% (P = 0.02), whereas CIDEA expression did not change (P = 0.20). These data demonstrate that, consistent with previous studies conducted in rodents, hepatic expression of CIDEA and CIDEC, but not CIDEB, is increased in obese humans. Moreover, the hepatic expression of CIDEC is downregulated by marked weight loss.
The paper describes a case of a patient with refractory hairy cell leukemia. In spite of the absence of CD25 expression, the disease was classified as a classical form according to the WHO classification (2008), as also confirmed by the detection of BRAFV600E mutation. The disease was characterized by resistance to all lines of therapy (interferon-a, splenectomy, cladribin). Clinical and hematological remission was achieved within 2 months of administration of the BRAF kinase inhibitor vemurafenib.
BACKGROUND: Treatment of advanced-stage idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) is a demanding challenge, and in Germany, medication regimen adjustments are often made during inpatient stays. Admissions often follow an acute worsening of symptoms and functioning. In order to reduce long and expensive inpatient stays, and to provide more frequent consultations, a 24/7 live stream telemedicine home treatment service was established.METHODS: A pilot study was conducted in which laptops were distributed to 50 patients for 1 year to see whether such a service was feasible (in terms of patient participation and compliance) and whether this intervention affected the patient's condition, measured in UPDRS, Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE), 39-item Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ39), and H & Y Scale.RESULTS: Seventy-two percent (36) of the patients were compliant and did not experience technical issues. Patients lived, on average, 198 ± 183 km away from the specialist clinic. In total, 264 video conversations took place with 6.9 ± 7.2 (0-29) calls per patient. We found a significant improvement in PDQ39 scores, but not in UPDRS, MMSE, or H & Y scores, at 1 year.CONCLUSIONS: Our data shows that 24/7 live stream telemedicine is feasible and can help to improve quality of life. However, a detailed preliminary review of the patient's willingness to use such a service should be made to obtain the best results. Improvement of the technical setup and network coverage would facilitate an improved service and increase efficiency.
Balancer chromosomes are genetic reagents that are used in Drosophila melanogaster for stock maintenance and mutagenesis screens. Despite their utility, balancer chromosomes are rarely used in mice because they are difficult to generate using conventional methods. Here we describe the engineering of a mouse balancer chromosome with the Cre-loxP recombination system. The chromosome features a 24-centiMorgan (cM) inversion between Trp53 (also known as p53) and Wnt3 on mouse chromosome 11 that is recessive lethal and dominantly marked with a K14-Agouti transgene. When allelic to a wild-type chromosome, the inversion suppresses crossing over in the inversion interval, accompanied by elevated recombination in the flanking regions. The inversion functions as a balancer chromosome because it can be used to maintain a lethal mutation in the inversion interval as a self-sustaining trans-heterozygous stock. This strategy can be used to generate similar genetic reagents throughout the mouse genome. Engineering of visibly marked inversions and deficiencies is an important step toward functional analyses of the mouse genome and will facilitate large-scale mutagenesis programs.
Neurofibromatosis type 1 and Noonan syndrome are both common genetic disorders with autosomal dominant inheritance. Similarities between neurofibromatosis type 1 and Noonan syndrome have been noted for over 20 years and patients who share symptoms of both conditions are often given the diagnosis of neurofibromatosis-Noonan syndrome (NFNS). The molecular basis of these combined phenotypes was poorly understood and controversially discussed over several decades until the discovery that the syndromes are related through disturbances of the Ras pathway. We present an infant male with coarse facial features, severe supravalvar pulmonic stenosis, automated atrial tachycardia, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, airway compression, severe neurological involvement, and multiple complications that lead to death during early infancy. The severity of clinical presentation and significant dysmorphic features suggested the possibility of a double genetic disorder in the Ras pathway instead of NFNS. Molecular analysis showed a missense mutation in exon 25 of the NF1 gene (4288A>G, p.N1430D) and a pathogenic mutation on exon 8 (922A>G, p.N308D) of the PTPN11 gene. Cardiovascular disease has been well described in patients with Noonan syndrome with PTPN11 mutations but the role of haploinsufficiency for neurofibromin in the heart development and function is not yet well understood. Our case suggests that a double genetic defect resulting in the hypersignaling of the Ras pathway may lead to complex cardiovascular abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, refractory arrhythmia, severe neurological phenotype, and early death.
BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects up to 16% of the adult population and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. People at highest risk from progressive CKD are defined by a sustained decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and/or the presence of significant albuminuria/proteinuria and/or more advanced CKD. Accurate mapping of the bio-clinical determinants of this group will enable improved risk stratification and direct the development of better targeted management for people with CKD.METHODS/DESIGN: The Renal Impairment In Secondary Care study is a prospective, observational cohort study, patients with CKD 4 and 5 or CKD 3 and either accelerated progression and/or proteinuria who are managed in secondary care are eligible to participate. Participants undergo a detailed bio-clinical assessment that includes measures of vascular health, periodontal health, quality of life and socio-economic status, clinical assessment and collection of samples for biomarker analysis. The assessments take place at baseline, and at six, 18, 36, 60 and 120 months; the outcomes of interest include cardiovascular events, progression to end stage kidney disease and death.DISCUSSION: The determinants of progression of chronic kidney disease are not fully understood though there are a number of proposed risk factors for progression (both traditional and novel). This study will provide a detailed bio-clinical phenotype of patients with high-risk chronic kidney disease (high risk of both progression and cardiovascular events) and will repeatedly assess them over a prolonged follow up period. Recruitment commenced in Autumn 2010 and will provide many outputs that will add to the evidence base for progressive chronic kidney disease.
Osteoporosis is an adverse effect of prednisolone therapy, although no study has been conducted on myasthenia gravis patients receiving high-dose prednisolone. We measured bone density in 36 patients (26 females and 10 males) who had undergone long-term prednisolone administration, and found a decrease in bone density in 31% of female patients and osteoporosis in only 11.5% (three cases). This frequency is lower than the presumptive rate of the general population in Japan (22.6%). No osteoporosis was detected in male patients. In conclusion, prednisolone-treated patients with myasthenia gravis have an acceptable risk of bone loss if prophylactic medication is administered.
The human calcitonin receptor (CTR) is a transmembrane peptide with dual action as a receptor for the hormone calcitonin and as an extracellular calcium sensor. Therefore, CTR dysfunction could lead to disorders of calcium metabolism associated with hypercalcemia, such as the Williams syndrome (WS). WS is a developmental disorder caused by a deletion at chromosome 7q11.23 that includes the elastin locus (ELN). We have mapped the CTR gene (CALCR) to chromosome band 7q21.3 by polymerase chain reaction and single-strand conformation analysis of somatic cell hybrids as well as fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to metaphase chromosome spreads. Two-color FISH cohybridizing CTR and ELN probes confirmed that CALCR maps telomeric to ELN. Subsequent analysis of chromosome spreads from four WS patients revealed deletion of the ELN locus in all of them and normal hybridization of CTR probes to both chromosome 7 homologues, indicating that CALCR lies outside the deleted region.
In this phase II trial, 105 eligible patients with no prior chemotherapy and advanced sarcoma received doxorubicin, ifosfamide, and dacarbazine (DTIC) with mesna uroprotection (MAID). Starting doses of these drugs were 60, 7,500, and 900 mg/m2 divided over 72 hours by continuous infusion, respectively. Mesna was given for 84 to 96 hours at 2,500 mg/m2/d. Myelosuppression was dose limiting, causing the only toxic death (sepsis). Nonhematologic toxicity consisted predominantly of anorexia and vomiting. Severe mucositis, macroscopic hematuria, renal tubular acidosis, renal failure, and CNS toxicity occurred in less than 5% of cycles. No cardiotoxicity was detected. The overall response rate (10% complete response [CR]) was 47% (95% confidence intervals, 5% to 18% and 37% to 57%, respectively). Most responses (approximately 70%) were observed within two cycles. Median times to progression were 10 and 9 months, respectively. Histologic high tumor grade, lesions less than 5 cm, and less than 1 year from diagnosis to study entry correlated with the probability of response. The median survival was 16 months. Time from diagnosis to study entry, performance status, and extent of disease, but not histologic grade, correlated with survival. Following CR, two patients remain disease-free at 32 and 16 months. Of the 15 additional patients rendered disease-free with surgery, two remain disease-free at 30 and 18 months with no further therapy. While most relapses occurred in sites of prior involvement, death from CNS metastases occurred in 11 of the 80 patients with high-grade sarcomas, of whom seven were still responding systematically (three complete responders). Because of its substantial response in this phase II trial, the MAID regimen is being compared with doxorubicin and DTIC alone in advanced sarcomas and to observation in the adjuvant treatment of high-grade sarcomas in randomized trials.
Translocator protein (18 kDa, TSPO), previously known as the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor, is an outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) protein necessary for cholesterol import and steroid production. We reconstituted the mitochondrial targeting and insertion of TSPO into the OMM to analyze the signals and mechanisms required for this process. Initial studies indicated the formation of a mitochondrial 66 kDa complex through Blue Native-PAGE analysis. The formation of this complex was found to be dependent on the presence of ATP and the cytosolic chaperone Hsp90. Through mutational analysis we identified two areas necessary for TSPO targeting, import, and function: amino acids 103-108 (Schellman motif), which provide the necessary structural orientation for import, and the cholesterol-binding C-terminus required for insertion. Although the translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane (TOM) complex proteins Tom22 and Tom40 were present in the OMM, the TOM complex did not interact with TSPO. In search of proteins involved in TSPO import, we analyzed complexes known to interact with TSPO by mass spectrometry. Formation of the 66 kDa complex was found to be dependent on an identified protein, Metaxin 1, for formation and TSPO import. The level of import of TSPO into steroidogenic cell mitochondria was increased following treatment of the cells with cAMP. These findings suggest that the initial targeting of TSPO to mitochondria is dependent upon the presence of cytosolic chaperones interacting with the import receptor Tom70. The C-terminus plays an important role in targeting TSPO to mitochondria, whereas its import into the OMM is dependent upon the presence of the Schellman motif. Final integration of TSPO into the OMM occurs via its interaction with Metaxin 1. Import of TSPO into steroidogenic cell mitochondria is regulated by cAMP.
Intoxications due to organophosphate insecticides are common in our country, since agriculture has an important place. Besides the well known acute cholinergic toxicity, these compounds may cause late-onset distal polyneuropathy occurring two to three weeks after the acute exposure. An eight-year-old boy and a 13-year-old girl admitted to the hospital with gait disturbances. Beginning 15 and 20 days, respectively, after organophosphate ingestion. Neurologic examination revealed bilateral dropped foot, absent Achilles tendon reflexes and peripheral sensory loss. Electromyography demonstrated motor weighed sensory-motor polyneuropathy with axonal degeneration significant in the distal parts of bilateral lower extremities. Biochemical, radiological findings and magnetic resonance imagings were normal. The two cases were taken under a physiotherapy program. The two cases are presented here since organophosphate poisonings are common in our country, and since late-onset polyneuropathy is not a well known clinical presentation as acute toxicity.
More than 20 human diseases are related to protein misfolding which causes formation of amyloids, fibrillar aggregates of normally soluble proteins. Such diseases are called amyloid diseases or amyloidoses. Of them only prion diseases are transmissible. Amyloids of the prion type are described in lower eukaryotes. However, in contrast to mammalian prions, which cause incurable neurodegenerative diseases, prions of lower eukaryotes are related to some non-chromosomally inherited phenotypic traits. Here we summarize the results of studies of prions of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and of the use of yeast model for investigation of some human amyloidoses, such as prion diseases, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's diseases.
To investigate the specific contribution of select MHC class II genes on the development of murine lupus, H-2 congenic (NZB x BXSB)F1 hybrid mice bearing either H-2b/b, H-2d/b, or H-2d/d haplotypes were generated. We compared the clinical development (autoantibody production and glomerulonephritis) of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in these three F1 hybrids in the presence or absence of the mutant gene, Yaa (Y chromosome-linked autoimmune acceleration), which normally accelerates the progression of murine SLE. (NZB x BXSB)F1 hybrid female mice bearing either the H-2b/b or H-2d/b haplotype developed a rapid course of severe SLE, while the appearance of disease was markedly delayed in H-2d/d hybrid females. However, in the presence of the Yaa gene, H-2d/d F1 males developed SLE as severe as H-2b/b and H-2d/b F1 males. These data indicate that (a) the conventional H-2b is a haplotype leading to susceptibility for murine SLE, while H-2d is a relatively resistant haplotype; (b) the H-2b haplotype exhibits a dominant effect on autoimmune responses, similar to the classical MHC-linked Ir gene effect; and (c) most strikingly, the Yaa gene totally abrogates the MHC effect on murine lupus in (NZB x BXSB)F1 hybrid mice.
HLA-A*31:01 was reported to be associated with carbamazepine (CBZ)-induced severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR), including drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). We conducted an international study using consensus diagnosis criteria to enroll a total of 93 patients with CBZ-SCAR from Europe or Asia. We found that HLA-A*31:01 showed a significant association with CBZ-DRESS in Europeans (P<0.001; odds ratio (OR) (95% confidence interval (CI))=57.6 (11.0-340)), and the strong association was also found in Chinese (P<0.001; OR (95% CI)=23.0 (4.2-125)). However, HLA-A*31:01 had no association with CBZ-SJS/TEN in neither Chinese nor Europeans. By comparison, HLA-B*15:02 showed a strong association with CBZ-SJS/TEN in Chinese (P<0.001, OR (95% CI)=58.1 (17.6-192)). A meta-analysis of this and other published studies confirmed that in all populations, HLA-A*31:01 had an extremely strong association with CBZ-DRESS (P<0.001, a pooled OR (95% CI)=13.2 (8.4-20.8)), but a much weaker association with CBZ-SJS/TEN (P=0.01, OR (95% CI)=3.94 (1.4-11.5)). Our data revealed that HLA-A*31:01 is a specific predictor for CBZ-DRESS but not for CBZ-SJS/TEN. More studies are needed to investigate the genetic determinant of CBZ-SJS/TEN in Europeans. Considering the potential clinical utility, the cost-effectiveness of the combined HLA-A*31:01 and HLA-B*15:02 genetic test to prevent CBZ-SCAR in Chinese needs further investigation.
Among yeasts that underwent whole-genome duplication (WGD), Kluyveromyces polysporus represents the lineage most distant from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. By sequencing the K. polysporus genome and comparing it with the S. cerevisiae genome using a likelihood model of gene loss, we show that these species diverged very soon after the WGD, when their common ancestor contained >9,000 genes. The two genomes subsequently converged onto similar current sizes (5,600 protein-coding genes each) and independently retained sets of duplicated genes that are strikingly similar. Almost half of their surviving single-copy genes are not orthologs but paralogs formed by WGD, as would be expected if most gene pairs were resolved independently. In addition, by comparing the pattern of gene loss among K. polysporus, S. cerevisiae, and three other yeasts that diverged after the WGD, we show that the patterns of gene loss changed over time. Initially, both members of a duplicate pair were equally likely to be lost, but loss of the same gene copy in independent lineages was increasingly favored at later time points. This trend parallels an increasing restriction of reciprocal gene loss to more slowly evolving gene pairs over time and suggests that, as duplicate genes diverged, one gene copy became favored over the other. The apparent low initial sequence divergence of the gene pairs leads us to propose that the yeast WGD was probably an autopolyploidization.
Treatment of childhood uveitis associated with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is a challenge for both, ophthalmologists and pediatricians. In this study, we use the tools of evidence based medicine (EBM) to analyse studies concerning disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARD)/ immunosuppressive drugs and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) blocking agents. Most experience among DMARD's/ immunosuppressive drugs has been obtained with methotrexate (MTX) in juvenile idiopathic arthritis. However, controlled studies in uveitis are still missing, so that treatment with MTX and all other immunosuppressive drugs (ciclosporine A, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil) only reaches an evidence level III (expert opinion, clinical experience or descriptive study). Studies on TNFalpha-blocking agents reach an evidence level II-III, depending on the substance. In future, MTX will have to be examined in comparison to the new biological substance classes (e.g., tumor necrosis factor-alpha-blockers) for the treatment of uveitis in juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Controlled studies which have led to the approval of drugs for JIA are needed for uveitis in order to have the most effective and safe therapy for children with uveitis, who do not respond to conventional therapy with local and systemic steroids.
Study of structure/function relationships constitutes an important field of research, especially for modification of protein function and drug design. However, the fact that rational design (i.e. the modification of amino acid sequences by means of directed mutagenesis, based on knowledge of the three-dimensional structure) appears to be much less efficient than irrational design (i.e. random mutagenesis followed by in vitro selection) clearly indicates that we understand little about the relationships between primary sequence, three-dimensional structure and function. The use of evolutionary approaches and concepts will bring insights to this difficult question. The increasing availability of multigene family sequences that has resulted from genome projects has inspired the creation of novel in silico evolutionary methods to predict details of protein function in duplicated (paralogous) proteins. The underlying principle of all such approaches is to compare the evolutionary properties of homologous sequence positions in paralogs. It has been proposed that the positions that show switches in substitution rate over time--i.e., 'heterotachous sites'--are good indicators of functional divergence. However, it appears that heterotachy is a much more general process, since most variable sites of homologous proteins with no evidence of functional shift are heterotachous. Similarly, it appears that switches in substitution rate are as frequent when paralogous sequences are compared as when orthologous sequences are compared. Heterotachy, instead of being indicative of functional shift, may more generally reflect a less specific process related to the many intra- and inter-molecular interactions compatible with a range of more or less equally viable protein conformations. These interactions will lead to different constraints on the nature of the primary sequences, consistently with theories suggesting the non-independence of substitutions in proteins. However, a specific type of amino acid variation might constitute a good indicator of functional divergence: substitutions occurring at positions that are generally slowly evolving. Such substitutions at constrained sites are indeed much more frequent soon after gene duplication. The identification and analysis of these sites by complementing structural information with evolutionary data may represent a promising direction to future studies dealing with the functional characterization of an ever increasing number of multi-gene families identified by complete genome analysis.
Tamoxifen is the standard first-line hormonal therapy for premenopausal women with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive metastatic breast cancer (BC). One of the crucial mechanisms underlying hormonal therapy resistance is the collateral activation of the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway. We explored whether PI3K inhibitors, buparlisib and alpelisib, enhance the efficacy of tamoxifen against ER-positive BC cells. We have observed a synergism between alpelisib or buparlisib and tamoxifen in the treatment for ER-positive BC cell lines harboring different PI3K alterations. Immunoblotting analysis showed alpelisib, buparlisib, or either drug in combination with tamoxifen downregulated the PI3K downstream targets in the MCF-7 and ZR75-1 cells. In the MCF-7 cells transfected with a constitutive active (myristoylated) AKT1 construct or mutant ER, the synergistic effect between alpelisib and tamoxifen was markedly attenuated, indicating that synergism depends on AKT inhibition or normally functioning ER. Combining alpelisib or buparlisib with tamoxifen also attenuated MCF-7 tumor growth in Balb/c nude mice. Our data suggest that additional PI3K blockade might be effective in enhancing the therapeutic effect of tamoxifen in ER-positive BC and support the rationale combination in clinical trials.
Imaging the cerebral serotonin 2A (5-HT2A ) receptors with positron emission tomography (PET) has been carried out in humans with [(11) C]MDL 100907 and [(18) F]altanserin. Recently, the MDL 100907 analogue [(18) F]MH.MZ was developed combining the selectivity profile of MDL 100907 and the favourable radiophysical properties of fluorine-18. Here, we present a direct comparison of [(18) F]altanserin and [(18) F]MH.MZ. 5-HT2A receptor binding in pig cortex and cerebellum was investigated by autoradiography with [(3) H]MDL 100907, [(18) F]MH.MZ, and [(18) F]altanserin. [(18) F]MH.MZ and [(18) F]altanserin were investigated in Danish Landrace pigs by brain PET scanning at baseline and after i.v. administration of blocking doses of ketanserin. Full arterial input function and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis allowed for tissue-compartment kinetic modeling of PET data. In vitro autoradiography showed high binding in cortical regions with both [(18) F]MH.MZ and [(18) F]altanserin. Significant 5-HT2A receptor binding was also found in the pig cerebellum, thus making this region unsuitable as a reference region for in vivo data analysis in this species. The cortical binding of [(18) F]MH.MZ and [(18) F]altanserin was blocked by ketanserin supporting that both radioligands bind to 5-HT2A receptors in the pig brain. In the HPLC analysis of pig plasma, [(18) F]MH.MZ displayed a fast and reproducible metabolism resulting in hydrophilic radiometabolites only whereas the metabolic profile of [(18) F]altanserin as expected showed lipophilic radiometabolites. Due to the slow kinetics of [(18) F]MH.MZ in high-binding regions in vivo, we suggest that [(18) F]MH.MZ will be an appropriate tracer for low binding regions where kinetics will be faster, whereas [(18) F]altanserin is a suitable tracer for high-binding regions.
Transplantation of human cardiomyoblast-like cells (hCLCs) from human adipose tissue-derived multi-lineage progenitor cells improved left ventricular function and survival of rats with myocardial infarction. Here we examined the effect of intracoronary artery transplantation of human CLCs in a swine model of chronic heart failure. Twenty-four pigs underwent balloon-occlusion of the first diagonal branch followed by reperfusion, with a second balloon-occlusion of the left ascending coronary artery 1 week later followed by reperfusion. Four weeks after the second occlusion/reperfusion, 17 of the 18 surviving animals with severe chronic MI (ejection fraction <35% by echocardiography) were immunosuppressed then randomly assigned to receive either intracoronary artery transplantation of hCLCs hADMPCs or placebo lactic Ringer's solution with heparin. Intracoronary artery transplantation was followed by the distribution of DiI-stained hCLCs into the scarred myocardial milieu. Echocardiography at post-transplant days 4 and 8 weeks showed rescue and maintenance of cardiac function in the hCLCs transplanted group, but not in the control animals, indicating myocardial functional recovery by hCLCs intracoronary transplantation. At 8 week post-transplantation, 7 of 8 hCLCs transplanted animals were still alive compared with only 1 of the 5 control (p=0.0147). Histological studies at week 12 post-transplantation demonstrated engraftment of the pre DiI-stained hCLCs into the scarred myocardium and their expression of human specific alpha-cardiac actin. Human alpha cardiac actin-positive cells also expressed cardiac nuclear factors; nkx2.5 and GATA-4. Our results suggest that intracoronary artery transplantation of hCLCs is a potentially effective therapeutic strategy for future cardiac tissue regeneration.
Sodium channels are principal molecular determinants responsible for myocardial conduction and maintenance of the cardiac rhythm. Calcium ions (Ca2+) have a fundamental role in the coupling of cardiac myocyte excitation and contraction, yet mechanisms whereby intracellular Ca2+ may directly modulate Na channel function have yet to be identified. Here we show that calmodulin (CaM), a ubiquitous Ca2+-sensing protein, binds to the carboxy-terminal 'IQ' domain of the human cardiac Na channel (hH1) in a Ca2+-dependent manner. This binding interaction significantly enhances slow inactivation-a channel-gating process linked to life-threatening idiopathic ventricular arrhythmias. Mutations targeted to the IQ domain disrupted CaM binding and eliminated Ca2+/CaM-dependent slow inactivation, whereas the gating effects of Ca2+/CaM were restored by intracellular application of a peptide modelled after the IQ domain. A naturally occurring mutation (A1924T) in the IQ domain altered hH1 function in a manner characteristic of the Brugada arrhythmia syndrome, but at the same time inhibited slow inactivation induced by Ca2+/CaM, yielding a clinically benign (arrhythmia free) phenotype.
Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare disorder characterized by recurrent attacks of swelling that may involve multiple anatomical locations. In the majority of patients, it is caused by a functional or quantitative defect in the C1 inhibitor (C1-INH), which is an important regulator of the complement, fibrinolytic, kallikrein-kinin and coagulation systems. Standard treatments used for other types of angioedema are ineffective for HAE. Traditional therapies for HAE, including fresh frozen plasma, epsilon-aminocaproic acid and danazol, may be well tolerated and effective in some patients; however, there are limitations both in their safety and efficacy. Several novel therapies have completed phase III trials in the US, including: (i) plasma-derived C1-INH replacement therapies (Berinert P and Cinryze); (ii) a recombinant C1-INH replacement therapy (conestat alfa; Rhucin); (iii) a kallikrein inhibitor (ecallantide [DX-88]); and (iv) a bradykinin-2-receptor antagonist (icatibant). Both Berinert P and Cinryze are reported to have excellent efficacy and safety data from phase III trials. Currently, only Cinryze has been approved for prophylactic use in the US. US FDA approval for other novel agents to treat HAE and for the use of Cinryze in the treatment of acute attacks is pending.
Favipiravir, an influenza virus RNA polymerase inhibitor, and peramivir, an influenza virus neuraminidase inhibitor, were evaluated alone and in combination against pandemic influenza A/California/04/2009 (H1N1) virus infections in mice. Infected mice were treated twice daily for 5 d starting 4 h after virus challenge. Favipiravir was 40%, 70%, and 100% protective at 20, 40, and 100 mg/kg/d. Peramivir was 30% protective at 0.5 mg/kg/d, but ineffective at lower doses when used as monotherapy. Combinations of favipiravir and peramivir increased the numbers of survivors by 10-50% when the 0.025, 0.05, and 0.1 mg/kg/d doses of peramivir were combined with 20 mg/kg/d favipiravir and when all doses of peramivir were combined with 40 mg/kg/d favipiravir. Three-dimensional analysis of drug interactions using the MacSynergy method indicates strong synergy for these drug combinations. In addition, an increase in lifespan for groups of mice treated with drug combinations, compared to the most effective monotherapy group, was observed for the 0.025, 0.05, and 0.1 mg/kg/d doses of peramivir combined with favipiravir at the 20 mg dose level. Therefore, the 20 mg/kg/d dose of favipiravir was selected for further combination studies. Increased survival was exhibited when this dose was combined with peramivir doses of 0.1, 0.25 and 0.5 mg/kg/d (1 mg/kg/d of peramivir alone was 100% protective in this experiment). Improved body weight relative to either compound alone was evident using 0.25, 0.5, and 1 mg/kg/d of peramivir. Significant reductions in lung hemorrhage score and lung weight were evident on day 6 post-infection. In addition, virus titers were reduced significantly on day 4 post-infection by combination therapy containing favipiravir combined with peramivir at 0.25 and 0.5 mg/kg/d. These data demonstrate that combinations of favipiravir and peramivir perform better than suboptimal doses of each compound alone for the treatment of influenza virus infections in mice.
BACKGROUND: The mammalian otoconial membrane is a dense extracellular matrix containing bio-mineralized otoconia. This structure provides the mechanical stimulus necessary for hair cells of the vestibular maculae to respond to linear accelerations and gravity. In teleosts, Otolin is required for the proper anchoring of otolith crystals to the sensory maculae. Otoconia detachment and subsequent entrapment in the semicircular canals can result in benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), a common form of vertigo for which the molecular basis is unknown. Several cDNAs encoding protein components of the mammalian otoconia and otoconial membrane have recently been identified, and mutations in these genes result in abnormal otoconia formation and balance deficits.PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we describe the cloning and characterization of mammalian Otolin, a protein constituent of otoconia and the otoconial membrane. Otolin is a secreted glycoprotein of ∼70 kDa, with a C-terminal globular domain that is homologous to the immune complement C1q, and contains extensive posttranslational modifications including hydroxylated prolines and glycosylated lysines. Like all C1q/TNF family members, Otolin multimerizes into higher order oligomeric complexes. The expression of otolin mRNA is restricted to the inner ear, and immunohistochemical analysis identified Otolin protein in support cells of the vestibular maculae and semi-circular canal cristae. Additionally, Otolin forms protein complexes with Cerebellin-1 and Otoconin-90, two protein constituents of the otoconia, when expressed in vitro. Otolin was also found in subsets of support cells and non-sensory cells of the cochlea, suggesting that Otolin is also a component of the tectorial membrane.CONCLUSION: Given the importance of Otolin in lower organisms, the molecular cloning and biochemical characterization of the mammalian Otolin protein may lead to a better understanding of otoconial development and vestibular dysfunction.
BACKGROUND INFORMATION: STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) is an important transcription factor involved in many biological events, including apoptosis, tumorigenesis, angiogenesis and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. However, no direct evidence for a role of STAT3 in 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation has been reported.RESULTS: In the present study, we found that rapid activation of STAT3, lasting for more than 48 h, was elicited upon induction of adipogenesis. Both the STAT3-selective inhibitor stattic and the JAK2 (Janus kinase 2)/STAT3-selective inhibitors AG490 and Gö6976 inhibited STAT3 activation, leading to the suppression of adipocyte differentiation. Adipocyte differentiation was also suppressed by STAT3 siRNA (small interfering RNA) or dominant-negative STAT3. Interestingly, the PPARgamma (peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor gamma) agonist TAZ (troglitazone) abolished the STAT3-inhibitor- and RNAi (RNA interference)-mediated suppression of adipogenesis. However, TAZ treatment had no effect on the stattic- and AG490-mediated down-regulation of STAT3 activation, suggesting that STAT3 regulates adipocyte differentiation through signalling that occurs upstream of PPARgamma.CONCLUSION: These data indicate that STAT3 functions as a critical factor for adipogenesis via a mechanism involving the PPARgamma activation pathway.
Epilepsy is among the most frequent findings in many, especially autosomal, chromosome aberrations. Its incidence, however, is very variable, and there are very few aberrations in which epilepsy is a constant finding. Even siblings and monozygotic twins with the same aberration are often discordant for seizure disorders. Similar observations can be made for congenital (major) malformations in chromosome aberrations. The common explanation is that in these instances epilepsy is not caused by the action of a single gene in single or triple dose, but is influenced by the combined action of a number of genes within and outside of the aneuploid segment. The situation is comparable to a polygenic model of inheritance. Gene mutations associated with epilepsy are known, to date, only for two disorders: the lissencephaly 1 gene in Miller-Dieker syndrome and mutations in the UBE3A gene in Angelman syndrome. Chromosome aberrations in which epilepsy is a major and consistent finding include Angelman syndrome due to loss of the maternal 15q11.2-q12 segment, tetrasomy of the maternal segment 15pter-q13 due to an additional inv dup chromosome, Miller-Dieker syndrome due to deletion of the 17p13.3 segment including the lissencephaly1 gene, ring chromosome 20, and Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome due to deletion of at least the 4p16.3 segment.
OBJECTIVE: Previous studies have suggested a link between heart rate (HR) following trauma and the development of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This study expands on previous work by evaluating HR in burn patients followed longitudinally for symptoms of acute stress disorder (ASD) and PTSD.METHOD: Data were collected from consecutive patients admitted to the Johns Hopkins Burn Center, Baltimore, Maryland, between 1997 and 2002. Patients completed the Stanford Acute Stress Reaction Questionnaire (n = 157) to assess symptoms of ASD. The Davidson Trauma Scale was completed at 1 (n = 145), 6 (n = 106), 12 (n = 94), and 24 (n = 66) months postdischarge to assess symptoms of PTSD. Heart rate in the ambulance, emergency room, and burn unit were obtained by retrospective medical chart review.RESULTS: Pearson correlations revealed a significant relationship between HR in the ambulance (r = 0.32, P = .016) and burn unit (r = 0.30, P = .001) and ASD scores at baseline. Heart rate in the ambulance was related to PTSD avoidance cluster scores at 1, 6, 12, and 24 months. In women, HR in the ambulance was correlated with PTSD scores at 6 (r = 0.65, P = .005) and 12 (r = 0.78, P = .005) months. When covariates (gender, β-blockers, Brief Symptom Inventory Global Severity Index score) were included in multivariate linear regression analyses, ambulance HR was associated with ASD and PTSD scores at baseline and 1 month, and the interaction of ambulance HR and gender was associated with PTSD scores at 6 and 12 months. Multivariate logistic regression results were similar at baseline and 12 months, which included an HR association yet no interaction at 6 months and a marginal interaction at 1 month.CONCLUSIONS: While peritraumatic HR is most robustly associated with PTSD symptom severity, HR on admission to burn unit also predicts the development of ASD. Gender and avoidance symptoms appear particularly salient in this relationship, and these factors may aid in the identification of subgroups for which HR serves as a biomarker for PTSD. Future work may identify endophenotypic measures of increased risk for PTSD, targeting subgroups for early intervention.
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Voltage-sensitive calcium channel conductance is essential for the nervous system to signal a painful event. However, intrathecal administration of L-type calcium channel blockers does not provide analgesia. The present investigation was designed to assess the safety and analgesic efficacy of ziconotide, a new N-type calcium channel blocker, when administered intrathecally to patients with acute postoperative pain.METHODS: This randomized, double-blind, pilot study included patients undergoing elective total abdominal hysterectomy, radical prostatectomy, or total hip replacement. After intrathecal injection of local anesthetic and before surgical incision, a continuous intrathecal infusion of either placebo or 1 of 2 doses of ziconotide (0.7 microg/h or 7.0 microg/h) was started and continued for 48 to 72 hours postoperatively. Primary and secondary efficacy variables were the mean daily patient controlled analgesia (PCA) morphine equivalent consumption and visual analog pain intensity (VASPI) scores, respectively.RESULTS: Thirty patients received study drug; 26 were evaluable for efficacy. Mean daily PCA morphine equivalent consumption was less in patients receiving ziconotide than in placebo-treated patients, and the difference was statistically significant between 24 and 48 hours (P = .040). VASPI scores during the first 8 hours postoperatively were markedly lower in ziconotide-treated than in placebo-treated patients. In 4 of 6 patients receiving the high-dose of ziconotide (7 microg/h), adverse events, such as dizziness, blurred vision, nystagmus, and sedation contributed to study drug being discontinued after 24 hours. After ziconotide discontinuation, these symptoms resolved.CONCLUSIONS: Ziconotide showed analgesic activity, as shown by decreased PCA morphine equivalent consumption and lower VASPI scores. Because of a favorable trend of decreased morphine consumption with an acceptable side-effect profile in the low-dose ziconotide group, 0.7 microg/h may be closer to the ideal dose than 7 microg/h. Large-scale studies are required to clarify this issue.
NRAMP2 (natural resistance-associated macrophage protein 2)/DMT1 (divalent metal transporter 1) is a divalent metal transporter conserved from prokaryotes to higher eukaryotes that exhibits an unusually broad substrate range, including Fe(2+), Zn(2+), Mn(2+), Cu(2+), Cd(2+), Co(2+), Ni(2+), and Pb(2+), and mediates active proton-coupled transport. Recently, it has been shown that the microcytic anemia (mk) mouse and the Belgrade (b) rat, which have inherited defects in iron transport that result in iron deficiency anemia, have the same missense mutation (G185R) in Nramp2. These findings strongly suggested that NRAMP2 is the apical membrane iron transporter in intestinal epithelial cells and the endosomal iron transporter in transferrin cycle endosomes of other cells. To investigate the cellular functions of NRAMP2, we generated a polyclonal antibody against the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain of human NRAMP2. The affinity-purified anti-NRAMP2 N-terminal antibody recognized a 90-116-kDa membrane-associated protein, and this band was shifted to 50 kDa by deglycosylation with peptide N-glycosidase F. Subcellular fractionation revealed that NRAMP2 co-sedimented with the late endosomal and lysosomal membrane proteins and LAMP-1 (lysosome-associated membrane protein 1), but not with the transferrin receptor in early endosomes. The intracellular localization of endogenous NRAMP2 and recombinant green fluorescent protein (GFP)-NRAMP2 was examined by immunofluorescence staining and by native fluorescence of GFP, respectively. Both endogenous and GFP-NRAMP2 were detected in vesicular structures and were colocalized with LAMP-2, but not with EEA1 (early endosome antigen 1) or the transferrin receptor. These results indicated that NRAMP2 is localized to the late endosomes and lysosomes, where NRAMP2 may function to transfer the endosomal free Fe(2+) into the cytoplasm in the transferrin cycle.
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death in the world. Prior to the era of targeted therapy, platinum-based doublet chemotherapy was the first-line therapy of choice for patients with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The availability of agents that target epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-tyrosine kinase, as well as inhibitors against anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene rearrangement or ROS-1 gene rearrangement product, has provided promising clinical benefits in specific subpopulations of NSCLC. At present, only first-generation EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) (erlotinib and gefitinib) are available for clinical use. Second-generation irreversible EGFR-TKIs, such as afatinib, are still in clinical trials. In current clinical practice, EGFR-TKI is the first-line treatment of choice for metastatic NSCLC patients with tumor EGFR mutation or as salvage therapy in NSCLC patients who received systemic chemotherapy previously. Platinum-based doublet chemotherapy continues to be the standard of care for those treatment-naïve patients with EGFR wild -type tumor or unknown EGFR status. Even though all investigators agree with the use of EGFR-TKI as the first-line treatment in tumor EGFR-mutated patients, only 10-30% of NSCLC patients have mutated EGFR, and there was no obvious survival difference when EGFR-TKIs were used in a second-line setting versus a first-line treatment in EGFR-mutated patients. Thus, the molecular complexity of lung cancer emphasizes the need for optimizing treatment by seeking a more personalized approach to care, including searching for driver oncogenes, managing the emergence of resistance and overcoming that resistance, and optimizing the sequence of treatment. Numerous other novel targeted agents are now in clinical development, including new agents targeting novel pathways and those that may have the potential to overcome the limitations or resistance associated with currently available EGFR-TKIs. In this report, we review the clinical data of EGFR-TKIs as molecular-targeted therapies in NSCLC.
BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Molluscum contagiosum is caused by the molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV) and is a very common skin disorder mainly involving young children Cryotherapy, curettage or some topical therapies have been applied for MC, but all of these treatments need several sessions, can be somewhat ineffective, and very painful. The present study assessed the impact of a single session of pulsed dye laser treatment of MC lesions which had proved resistant to other approaches Subjects and methods: Fifteen children comprised the study subjects, 11 boys and 4 girls, 3-5 years of age (mean 4.2 yr) with recalcitrant MC. Lesions were counted at baseline, and a single shot from a 585 nm pulsed dye laser was applied to each lesion (3 mm, 300 ms, 8.0 J/cm(2)). Lesions were counted again at 1 week post-treatment and followed for up to 3 months thereafter.RESULTS: All patients completed the study and no patient dropped out through pain or discomfort. Purpura was seen at each treated lesion immediately after irradiation, but at 1 week after treatment, lesion clearance was virtually complete which was maintained for 1 month, and no recurrence was seen at 3 months in 8 of the 15 patients who remained available for followup.CONCLUSIONS: A single treatment of MC lesions with the pulsed dye laser successfully cured even recalcitrant lesions with no recurrence on follow up, and was well tolerated by the young subjects.
BACKGROUND: The use of stent-assisted coiling (SAC) has been shown to be a treatment option for complex aneurysms. We reviewed systematically the immediate and mid-term angiographic results following treatment of wide-necked aneurysms with self-expanding stents and coils, as well as the peri- and postprocedural rate of complications.METHODS: A computerized database search was conducted from 01/2000 to 04/2011 using appropriate indexed terms on Pubmed. Inclusion criteria were: (1) homogeneous populations of ≥10 patients with wide-necked aneurysms; (2) use of a self-expandable neurovascular stent and coils for aneurysm treatment; (3) immediate and follow-up angiographic results; and (4) periprocedural and delayed thrombotic complications.RESULTS: Seventeen studies were included, containing retrospectively collected data on 656 patients/702 aneurysms. The target aneurysm was located on the anterior circulation in 78.4% of patients. The immediate rate of complete occlusion was 46.3%, (19.3-98.1%). The intra- and postprocedural rate of intrastent thrombosis or thromboembolic event was 4.6% and 4.3%, respectively. Complete occlusion was documented in 71.9% at last angiographic follow-up. The rate of recanalization was 13.2% of aneurysms (0-28.8%). Delayed in-stent stenosis occurred in 5.3% cases (0-20.6%).CONCLUSION: SAC has been considered a treatment option for selected wide-necked aneurysms in some institutions. The use of intracranial stents should take into consideration the risk of ischemic complications, recanalization, delayed in-stent stenosis; and the currently unknown lifetime risks for stenosis, vascular injury, device failure, and aneurysm recurrence related to intracranial stenting. There is an evident need for a prospective multicenter registry for all treated patients with SAC.
Malaria is a severe infectious disease with relatively high mortality, thus having been a scourge of humanity. There are a few candidate malaria vaccines that have shown a protective efficacy in humans against malaria. One of the candidate human malaria vaccines, which is based on human malaria sporozoites and called PfSPZ Vaccine, has been shown to protect a significant proportion of vaccine recipients from getting malaria. PfSPZ Vaccine elicits a potent response of hepatic CD8+ T cells that are specific for malaria antigens in non-human primates. To further characterize hepatic CD8+ T cells induced by the sporozoite-based malaria vaccine in a mouse model, we have used a cutting-edge Single-cell Barcode (SCBC) assay, a recently emerged approach/method for investigating the nature of T-cells responses during infection or cancer. Using the SCBC technology, we have identified a population of hepatic CD8+ T cells that are polyfunctional at a single cell level only in a group of vaccinated mice upon malaria challenge. The cytokines/chemokines secreted by these polyfunctional CD8+ T-cell subsets include MIP-1α, RANTES, IFN-γ, and/or IL-17A, which have shown to be associated with protective T-cell responses against certain pathogens. Therefore, a successful induction of such polyfunctional hepatic CD8+ T cells may be a key to the development of effective human malaria vaccine. In addition, the SCBC technology could provide a new level of diagnostic that will allow for a more accurate determination of vaccine efficacy.
To determine the association of tetracycline resistance determinants with tigecycline sensitivity, tetracycline-resistant Salmonella spp. isolated from clinical and food samples were tested for the presence of tetracycline resistance determinants, tigecycline sensitivity, and the impact of tetA on tigecycline resistance. In addition, the impacts of multiple resistance mechanisms on tigecycline resistance were determined using an isolate with ramR mutation. Of the 49 tetracycline-resistant Salmonella isolates screened, 32 were positive for tetA, 13 were positive for tetB, 2 were positive for tetC and 1 isolate was positive for both tetA and tetB. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of tigecycline for tetA-carrying isolates ranged from 0.19 mg/L to 3mg/L (mode 0.75 mg/L), whereas the MIC of tigecycline for tetB-carrying isolates ranged from 0.064 mg/L to 0.5mg/L (modes 0.25mg/L and 0.38 mg/L, excluding the isolate with both tetA and tetB). Double frameshift mutations in codons 201, 202 and 203 were observed in partial sequences of the tetA genes in these strains and the majority of published tetA gene sequences. Curing of the tetA genes from three isolates reduced the tigecycline MICs, whilst deletion of ramR increased tigecycline MICs. This study indicates that the tetA gene decreases sensitivity to tigecycline in Salmonella spp. at a low level. With additional resistance mechanisms, tetA-carrying strains can reach the breakpoint for tigecycline resistance.
BACKGROUND: The International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) is currently undergoing a revision process to develop the Eleventh Revision (ICD-11), but substantial modification of chapter 19 has not been proposed despite its known problems in describing injury severity and multiple injuries. Many facilities treating trauma patients perform duplicate coding for trauma diagnoses using two different classification systems, the ICD for administrative purposes and the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) for trauma registry, because unambiguous conversion of codes between the ICD and AIS is not always possible due to structural differences.AIM: We developed a new bridging classification system which can be unambiguously converted to both ICD and AIS.METHODS AND RESULTS: The bridging classification adopted multidimensional coding and addressed differences in granularity and classification boundaries by adopting the more detailed categorizations whenever the granularity and classification boundaries differed between the ICD and AIS. Then we showed that the bridging classification codes could unambiguously converted to both ICD and AIS.CONCLUSION: Once injuries are coded using the bridging classification, the ICD and AIS codes are readily available. Integrating the new bridging classification into the ICD-11, possibly as a clinical modification, would eliminate the necessity of complicated procedures for code conversion and duplicate coding, and benefit users by building on the strengths of both the ICD and AIS.
OBJECTIVES: This study sought to explore the potential role of noncontrast myocardial T1 mapping for detection of cardiac involvement in patients with primary amyloid light-chain (AL) amyloidosis.BACKGROUND: Cardiac involvement carries a poor prognosis in systemic AL amyloidosis. Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is useful for the detection of cardiac amyloid, but characteristic LGE patterns do not always occur or they appear late in the disease. Noncontrast characterization of amyloidotic myocardium with T1 mapping may improve disease detection. Furthermore, quantitative assessment of myocardial amyloid load would be of great value.METHODS: Fifty-three AL amyloidosis patients (14 with no cardiac involvement, 11 with possible involvement, and 28 with definite cardiac involvement based on standard biomarker and echocardiographic criteria) underwent CMR (1.5-T) including noncontrast T1 mapping (shortened modified look-locker inversion recovery [ShMOLLI] sequence) and LGE imaging. These were compared with 36 healthy volunteers and 17 patients with aortic stenosis and a comparable degree of left ventricular hypertrophy as the cardiac amyloid patients.RESULTS: Myocardial T1 was significantly elevated in cardiac AL amyloidosis patients (1,140 ± 61 ms) compared to normal subjects (958 ± 20 ms, p < 0.001) and patients with aortic stenosis (979 ± 51 ms, p < 0.001). Myocardial T1 was increased in AL amyloid even when cardiac involvement was uncertain (1,048 ± 48 ms) or thought absent (1,009 ± 31 ms). A noncontrast myocardial T1 cutoff of 1,020 ms yielded 92% accuracy for identifying amyloid patients with possible or definite cardiac involvement. In the AL amyloidosis cohort, there were significant correlations between myocardial T1 time and indices of systolic and diastolic dysfunction.CONCLUSIONS: Noncontrast T1 mapping has high diagnostic accuracy for detecting cardiac AL amyloidosis, correlates well with markers of systolic and diastolic dysfunction, and is potentially more sensitive for detecting early disease than LGE imaging. Elevated myocardial T1 may represent a direct marker of cardiac amyloid load. Further studies are needed to assess the prognostic significance of T1 elevation.
Over the last few years, several genes for monogenic forms of Parkinson's disease (PD) have been mapped and/or cloned. Mutations have been identified in the gene for alpha-synuclein in rare families with dominant PD, indicating that aggregation of this protein in Lewy bodies is probably a crucial step in the molecular pathogenesis of the disorder. A much more common cause for dominant PD, mutations in the gene for leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), has recently been identified. Mutations in the parkin gene, in DJ-1 and PINK1 all cause autosomal recessive parkinsonism of early onset. These genes have been implicated in the proteasomal protein degradation pathway, in the oxidative stress response and mitochondrial function. Mutations in recessive genes probably are pathogenic through loss-of-function mechanisms, suggesting that their wildtype products protect dopaminergic cells against a variety of insults. Evidence is emerging that at least some of these genes may play a direct role in the etiology of the common sporadic form of PD. Further, it is likely that the cellular pathways identified in rare monogenic variants of the disease also shed light on the molecular pathogenesis in typical sporadic PD.
We report the case of a Japanese boy whose dysmorphic features were consistent with those of Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome. The radiological features were characterized by late-onset craniosynostosis, arachnodactyly, undermodeling of short tubular bones, mildly undermodeled and slightly bowed long bones, twisted ribs and tall vertebral bodies with elongated neural arches. Apart from the craniosynostosis, these skeletal changes resembled those of frontometaphyseal dysplasia, a well-known craniotubular dysplasia. Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome also shares many clinical features with frontometaphyseal dysplasia.
OBJECTIVES: Preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) is defined as a rupture of the amniotic membranes occurring before 37 weeks of gestation and before the onset of labor. Extreme PPROM occurs prior to 26 weeks gestation and contributes to an increased risk of prematurity, leading to maternal and fetal complications. This study aims to estimate the risk factors associated with various maternal complications and to determine the worst outcomes in Omani females with extreme PPROM.METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted on 44 women with extreme PPROM, who delivered at Sultan Qaboos University Hospital (SQUH) from January 2006 to December 2011. Women with incomplete information, multiple gestations, or a preterm delivery resulting from medical intervention, as well as women who delivered elsewhere were excluded from the study.RESULTS: Forty-four women with extreme PPROM were included in our study. The results revealed the most important risk factor to be history of infection, which was noted in 24 study participants. The mean maternal age was 30 years. The mean gestational age at PPROM and at delivery were 20.7±3.2 (range: 16-26 weeks) and 29.7±7.6 weeks (range: 17-40 weeks), respectively. The maternal complications observed in this study included; infection which was seen in 20 (45%) patients, antepartum hemorrhage in 11 (25%) patients, and cesarean section which was required in 12 (27%) patients. There was no significant association between risk factors such as gestational age at delivery, parity, maternal age at PPROM, or maternal Body Mass Index (BMI) and cesarean section rate. Infection played a major role, both as a risk factor and in causing extreme PPROM, which in turn increased in 12 patients (27%). In the multivariable model for predicting the need for cesarean section (gestational age at delivery, parity, maternal age at PPROM in years and maternal BMI), none of the factors were statistically significant.CONCLUSION: Overall, concurrent infection rate was high among patients presenting with extreme PPROM. None of the baseline maternal factors predicted the need for cesarean section. This is likely due to the small sample size; hence, larger prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings.
We studied the role of the L-arginine-nitric oxide (NO) pathway in non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic (NANC) relaxation of the rabbit sphincter of Oddi by recording changes in isometric tension in response to electrical field stimulation in two series of experiments. In a first set of experiments, biliary sphincters of Oddi removed from New Zealand white rabbits were placed horizontally in an organ bath containing oxygenized, buffered (pH 7.4) Krebs solution. Contractile responses of the whole sphincter to field stimulation were determined. In the second set of experiments, sphincter of Oddi was divided into two parts and the effects of field stimulation were studied separately on areas close to the duodenal papilla (area I) and areas close to the common bile duct (area II). In the whole sphincter of Oddi, field stimulation induced an initial twitch-like contraction followed by relaxation proportional to the number of stimuli (3 and 10 stimuli at 20 Hz, 50 V, 0.1 ms). The magnitude of the contractile responses was considerably reduced by 1 microM atropine, phentolamine and oxprenolol (NANC solution). Field stimulation produced dose-dependent contractions of both segments of sphincter of Oddi in response to the same protocol as used with whole sphincter of Oddi. However, preincubation with NANC solution produced monophasic relaxations in response to field stimulation in area I, whereas area II preparations such as the whole sphincter of Oddi responded with contractions followed by minimal relaxations. Field stimulation failed to induce either contractions or relaxations in the presence of 1 microM tetrodotoxin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
A 32-year-old woman presented with low pressure headache 3 days after delivery of her baby. An assessment of postdural puncture headache was made. This was initially treated with analgesia, caffeine, and fluids for the presumed cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak. The woman was readmitted two days after her hospital discharge with generalised seizures. A brain scan showed features of intracranial hypotension, and she was treated for CSF leak using an epidural blood patch. Her symptoms worsened and three days later, she developed a left homonymous quadrantanopia. An MRI scan confirmed a right parietal haematoma with evidence of isolated cortical vein thrombosis (ICVT).

X-linked hydrocephalus (XLH) has an incidence of 1/30,000 male births and is characterized by intellectual disability, spastic paraplegia, adducted thumbs, and agenesis of corpus callosum, and/or corticospinal tract. The great proportion of cases is ascribed to loss of function mutations of L1CAM gene. Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) is characterized by the absence of ganglion cells in the submucosal and myenteric plexuses along a variable portion of the intestinal tract and has incidence of about 1/5,000. Although with several genes involved in its pathogenesis, the major HSCR gene is the RET proto-oncogene. To date only a few patients have been reported with both phenotypes and mutations in the L1CAM gene. In this report, we describe a new patient with concurrent XLH and HSCR. L1CAM mutational screening showed the presence of the G698R hemizygous mutation, which is a deleterious substitution affecting a key residue necessary for the correct folding of the protein. Moreover, the patient also carried the transcriptional enhancer RET mutation (c.73 + 9277T > C) in heterozygosis. We speculate that both the RET enhancer variant, and the L1CAM mutation may act in combination to produce the enteric phenotype, probably with the participation of other still unidentified molecular events. While it is obvious that additional studies are necessary to further delineate the association between XLH and HSCR in the presence of L1CAM mutations, the documentation of this new patient reinforces the role of this gene acting either in a direct or indirect way in the pathogenesis of Hirschsprung disease.
OBJECTIVE: Evaluate ustekinumab, an anti-interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-23 antibody, effects on radiographic progression in psoriatic arthritis (PsA).METHODS: We conducted preplanned integrated analyses of combined radiographic data from PSUMMIT-1 and PSUMMIT-2 phase 3, randomised, controlled trials. Patients had active PsA despite prior conventional and/or biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (≥5/66 swollen, ≥5/68 tender joints, C-reactive protein ≥3.0 mg/L, documented plaque psoriasis). Patients (PSUMMIT-1, n=615; PSUMMIT-2, n=312) were randomised to ustekinumab 45 mg, 90 mg, or placebo, at weeks (wk) 0, 4 and every (q) 12 wks. At wk 16, patients with <5% improvement in tender/swollen joint counts entered blinded early escape. All other placebo patients received ustekinumab 45 mg at wk 24 and wk 28, then q 12 wks. Radiographs of hands/feet at wks 0/24/52 were assessed using PsA-modified van der Heijde-Sharp (vdH-S) scores; combined PSUMMIT-1 and PSUMMIT-2 changes in total vdH-S scores from wk 0 to wk 24 comprised the prespecified primary radiographic analysis. Treatment effects were assessed using analysis of variance on van der Waerden normal scores (factors=treatment, baseline methotrexate usage, and study).RESULTS: Integrated data analysis results indicated that ustekinumab-treated patients (regardless of dose) demonstrated significantly less radiographic progression at wk 24 than did placebo recipients (wk 0-24 total vdH-S score mean changes: 0.4-combined/individual ustekinumab dose groups, 1.0-placebo; all p<0.02). From wk 24 to wk 52, inhibition of radiographic progression was maintained for ustekinumab-treated patients, and progression was substantially reduced among initial placebo recipients who started ustekinumab at wk 16 or wk 24 (wk 24 - wk 52, total vdH-S score mean change: 0.08).CONCLUSIONS: Ustekinumab 45 and 90 mg treatments significantly inhibited radiographic progression of joint damage in patients with active PsA.
Erythropoietin (EPO) and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents possess a high misuse potential in elite sport due to their ability to increase the oxygen transport capacity, which plays a vital role in enhancing endurance performance. Currently, a new generation of EPO-mimetic peptides is under development from which peginesatide (also referred to as Hematide™), a pegylated homodimeric peptide of approximately 45 kDa with no structural relationship to erythropoietin, is the most advanced drug candidate undergoing phase-III clinical trials. Since preventive doping research aims at the development of detection methods before a drug receives clinical approval, a selective and sensitive assay has to be established knowing that conventional doping control assays for EPO will not succeed in detecting peginesatide. Thus, a pegylated EPO-mimetic peptide simulating the structure and properties of the lead drug candidate peginesatide was synthesised as a model compound for this new class of emerging drugs and characterised by means of gel electrophoresis, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation (MALDI) mass spectrometry, as well as liquid chromatography/electrospray ionisation tandem mass spectrometry (LC/ESI-MS/MS) after proteolytic digestion. Based on these results, a mass spectrometric detection method of the product in plasma was developed targeting a pentapeptide fragment after protein precipitation and subtilisin digestion. Its fitness for purpose was evaluated by the determination of selected method characteristics focusing particularly on specificity, recovery (ca. 60%), and limit of detection (1 ng/mL).
Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) are important biological markers and regulators of cardiac function. The natriuretic peptide receptor A (NPRA), also known as NPR1 or guanylyl cyclase A, binds ANP and BNP to initiate transmembrane signal transduction by elevating the intracellular levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate. However, the effects and mechanisms downstream of NPRA are largely unknown. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the changes in the global pattern of mRNA and circular RNA (circRNA) expression in NPRA‑/‑ and NPRA+/+ myocardium. Differentially expressed mRNA molecules were characterised using Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis and were found to be primarily related to metabolic processes. Moreover, circRNA expression was also examined, and a possible competing endogenous RNA network consisting of circRNA, microRNA (miRNA), and mRNA molecules was constructed. The results of this study indicated that NPRA may play a role in cardiac metabolism, which could be mediated by circRNA through endogenous competition mechanisms. These findings may provide insight into future characterisation of various ceRNA network pathways.
OBJECTIVE: The monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8; SLC16A2) has a pivotal role in neuronal triiodothyronine (T(3)) uptake. Mutations of this transporter determine a distinct X-linked psychomotor retardation syndrome (Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome (AHDS)) that is attributed to disturbed thyroid hormone levels, especially elevated T(3) levels. We describe the genetic analysis of the MCT8 gene in a patient suspected for AHDS and the clinical and endocrine effects of L-thyroxine (LT(4)) or liothyronine (LT(3)) treatment intending to overcome the T(3) uptake resistance through alternative transporters.METHODS: The six exons of the MCT8 gene were amplified individually by PCR. As multiple exons were missing, the length of the X-chromosomal deletion was determined by a dense SNP array, followed by PCR-based fine mapping to define the exact borders of the deleted segment. The clinical and endocrine data of the patient during 6.5 years of LT(4) treatment and two periods (3 months each) of low- and high-dose LT(3) were evaluated.RESULTS: A partial deletion of the MCT8 gene (comprising five of six exons) was detected, confirming the suspected AHDS. MCT8 dysfunction was associated with partial resistance to T(3) at the hypothalamus and pituitary level, with normal responsiveness at the peripheral organs (liver and cardiovascular system). Thyroid hormone administration had no beneficial effect on the neurological status of the patient.CONCLUSION: We identified a 70 kb deletion encompassing exons 2-6 of the MCT8 gene in our AHDS patient. Both LT(4) and LT(3) administration had no therapeutic effect. Alternatively, treatment of AHDS patients with thyroid hormone analogs should be considered.
IMPORTANCE: Although levodopa remains the most effective oral pharmacotherapy for Parkinson disease (PD), its use is often limited by wearing off effect and dyskinesias. Management of such complications continues to be a significant challenge.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy and safety of safinamide (an oral aminoamide derivative with dopaminergic and nondopaminergic actions) in levodopa-treated patients with motor fluctuations.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: From March 5, 2009, through February 23, 2012, patients from academic PD care centers were randomized (1:1 ratio) to receive double-blind adjunctive safinamide or placebo for 24 weeks. All patients had idiopathic PD with "off" time (time when medication effect has worn off and parkinsonian features, including bradykinesia and rigidity, return) of greater than 1.5 hours per day (excluding morning akinesia). Their pharmacotherapy included oral levodopa plus benserazide or carbidopa in a regimen that had been stable for 4 weeks or longer. During screening, each patient's regimen was optimized to minimize motor fluctuations. Study eligibility required that after 4 weeks of optimized treatment, the patients still have more than 1.5 hours per day of off time. Adverse events caused the premature study discontinuation of 12 individuals (4.4%) in the safinamide group and 10 individuals (3.6%) in the placebo group.INTERVENTIONS: Patients took safinamide or placebo as 1 tablet daily with breakfast. If no tolerability issues arose by day 14, the starting dose, 50 mg, was increased to 100 mg.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The prespecified primary outcome was each treatment group's mean change from baseline to week 24 (or last "on" treatment value) in daily "on" time (relief of parkinsonian motor features) without troublesome dyskinesia, as assessed from diary data.RESULTS: At 119 centers, 549 patients were randomized (mean [SD] age, 61.9 [9.0] years; 334 male [60.8%] and 371 white [67.6%]): 274 to safinamide and 275 to placebo. Among them, 245 (89.4%) receiving safinamide and 241 (87.6%) receiving placebo completed the study. Mean (SD) change in daily on time without troublesome dyskinesia was +1.42 (2.80) hours for safinamide, from a baseline of 9.30 (2.41) hours, vs +0.57 (2.47) hours for placebo, from a baseline of 9.06 (2.50) hours (least-squares mean difference, 0.96 hour; 95% CI, 0.56-1.37 hours; P < .001, analysis of covariance). The most frequently reported adverse event was dyskinesia (in 40 [14.6%] vs 15 [5.5%] and as a severe event in 5 [1.8%] vs 1 [0.4%]).CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The outcomes of this trial support safinamide as an effective adjunct to levodopa in patients with PD and motor fluctuations to improve on time without troublesome dyskinesia and reduce wearing off.TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier NCT00627640.
We here described a 39-year-old woman with a severe chronic mood disorder, refractory to antidepressive therapy who showed a significant improvement after a self-prescription of high doses of liothyronine (T(3)). A modified Refetoff protocol was carried out to study the role of thyroid hormones on her clinical and biochemical responses. Depression severity was assessed by the HAM-D and MADRS Depression Rating Scales. Sequencing of Thyroid Receptors (TR) alpha1 and beta1 genes was done. At the final stage of the study, plasma T3 and free T3 were >800 ng/dl (80-180) and 1409 pg/dl (230-420), respectively. No changes in the cardiovascular parameters, alkaline phosphatase isoenzymes, creatinine kinase, or ferritin were observed. However, an improvement in mood was detected by specific scores (HAM-D 24 to 8; MADRS 40 to 11). No mutations in DNA- and hormone-binding-domains of TRbeta1 and TRalpha1 genes were found in proband, suggesting that the defect could be due to an unknown mutation in either the TR gene or a post receptor abnormality. These results support the existence of a peripheral RTH manifestation as a refractory chronic depression reverted by high doses of T(3). Screening for RTH in refractory chronic depression may provide an alternative treatment for this psychiatric condition.
AIM OF STUDY: An analysis of incidences of selected birth defects in the Czech Republic in 2000 - 2008 period.TYPE OF STUDY: Retrospective epidemiological analysis of birth defects incidences in births and total birth defects incidences (including prenatally diagnosed cases) from the Czech National Birth Defects Register database.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data from the National Birth Defects Register (Institute for Health Information and Statistics) in the Czech Republic in the 2000 - 2008 period were used along with data on prenatally diagnosed defects from particular departments of medical genetics. Sixteen selected defects (anencephaly, spina bifida, encephalocele, congenital hydrocephalus, coarctation of aorta, transposition of great vessels, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, Fallot tetralogy, omphalocele, gastroschisis, diaphragmatic hernia, oesophageal atresia and stenosis, anorectal malformations, Down syndrome, Edwards syndrome and Patau syndrome) were analyzed in detail.RESULTS: There were 119 570 live births (61 326 boys and 58 244 girls) in 2008. In the same period, 4664 live births with a birth defect (under the age of one year) were reported, out of which 2754 boys and 1910 girls. Mean incidence was 390.06 (449.08 in boys and 327.93 in girls) per 10 000 live births. In 1994 - 2006, totally 1 238 398 children were born, out of which more than 42 000 with a birth defect. In the 2000 - 2006 period, absolute numbers of diagnosed live births with birth defect varied between 3600 - 3800 cases per year while in 2007 and 2008 years absolute numbers raised over 4600 cases per year. During 2000 - 2008 period following mean incidences (per 10 000 live births) of selected defects were ascertained (total incidences including prenatal diagnostics in brackets): anencephaly 0 - 0.3 (1.9 - 3.7), spina bifida 0.7 - 2.3 (3.2 - 5.2), encephalocele 0.1 - 0.4 (0.9 - 2.4), congenital hydrocephalus 1.6 - 3.5 (5.3 - 7.0), coarctation of aorta 3.9 - 5.2 (4.8 - 6.1), transposition of great vessels 2.9 - 4.5 (3.2 - 5.0), hypoplastic left heart syndrome 0.7 - 2.3 (2.2 - 4.3), Fallot tetralogy 2.6 - 4.0 (3.2 - 4.4), omphalocele 1.0 - 1.7 (1.8 - 3.8), gastroschisis 0.2 - 1.2 (2.4 - 3.4), diaphragmatic hernia 1.3 - 2.9 (1.5 - 3.9), Down syndrome 3.3 - 6.5 (15.8 - 22.2), Edwards syndrome 0.2 - 1.0 (3.5 - 5.8) and Patau syndrome 0.2 - 1.0 (1.2 - 2.6).CONCLUSIONS: There has been no major change in birth defect incidences in live births in the Czech Republic in last years. Number of non-viable defects has decreased in stillbirths and in perinatal mortality in the Czech Republic. An incidence of some defects has decreased mostly due to a nation-wide system of prenatal diagnostics; some incidences remain stable in live-birth population in others incidences have increased. A total incidence has mostly increased (anencephaly being an exception) mostly due to an earlier prenatal diagnostics. In chromosomal syndromes, an increasing maternal age as well as a growing number of mothers of 35 years of age and over has contributed to the increased incidences.
Among people with epilepsy, there is a 20-fold higher risk of dying suddenly and unexpectedly compared with the general population. This phenomenon is called sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) and the term is used when sudden death occurs in an otherwise reasonably healthy person with epilepsy and the autopsy is unrevealing. In most cases, SUDEP occurs during sleep and is unwitnessed. Risk factors for SUDEP include the presence or number of generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS), nocturnal seizures, young age at epilepsy onset, longer duration of epilepsy, dementia, absence of cerebrovascular disease, asthma, male gender, symptomatic aetiology of epilepsy and alcohol abuse. Suggested factors predisposing to SUDEP have included long-QT-related mutations, impaired serotonergic brain stem control of respiration, altered autonomic control and seizures with a pronounced postictal suppression and respiratory compromise. Final events that may lead up to SUDEP are a postictal CNS shutdown with pronounced EEG suppression, ictal or postictal apnoea, and ictal cardiac arrhythmia. It is unknown whether antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) modify the risk for SUDEP. Studies have consistently found that the presence or number of GTCS is associated with an increased risk for SUDEP. Since continued presence of GTCS clearly necessitates the use of AEDs, both factors must be taken into account to determine whether one or both increases the risk for SUDEP. Some studies suggest that AEDs, such as lamotrigine and carbamazepine, may increase the risk of SUDEP, but rarely adjust for GTCS. Other studies, which have found that AEDs are associated with a decreased SUDEP risk, either adjust for the number of GTCS or are meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials. Studies assessing the impact of AEDs on the risk for SUDEP are limited because SUDEP is a rare event, making randomized clinical trials impossible to conduct. Observational studies focus on whether or not an AED was prescribed. When postmortem AED concentrations are assessed they are usually low or absent, perhaps due to sampling in deceased individuals, making it difficult to fully resolve whether AEDs increase or decrease SUDEP risk. Despite these caveats, the evidence suggests that AEDs are not associated with an increased risk for SUDEP on a population level, although some individuals may be susceptible to effects of AEDs. Recent evidence from a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials of adjunctive AEDs at efficacious doses provides strong support for AED treatment as mono- or polytherapy to increase seizure control and protect against SUDEP in patients with refractory epilepsy. For patients for whom seizure control is unattainable, supervision or monitoring may prevent SUDEP, though this has never been formally tested.
A 45-year-old man developed chorea, behavioural changes, moderate amyotrophy and polyneuropathy. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and increased serum lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase (CK) were found. Acanthocytes were not detected. The absence of XK protein and faintly expressed Kell antigens on erythrocytes were found. Genetic test revealed a R133X mutation of the XK gene, confirming the McLeod syndrome. After 7 years he suddenly developed delirium followed by severe hypoglycaemia, hyperthermia, rhabdomyolysis, hepatic and renal failure. Malignant arrhythmia caused death.
Transient diplopia, blepharoptosis, or both conditions are rare postoperative complications of blepharoplasty performed with the patient under local anesthesia. It has been hypothesized that some cases of postoperative diplopia and blepharoptosis could be attributed to the myotoxic effects of local anesthetics to the extraocular muscles and the levator muscle or to the neurotoxic effects of lidocaine. In 30 cadavers, the superior division of the oculomotor nerve was severed en bloc 1.5 cm anterior to the annulus of Zinn with the levator palpebrae superioris (LPS) and the superior rectus muscles. These muscles were detached from their origins, and their attachments to the scleral and tarsal plates were divided respectively. The specimens were treated in guanidine-hydrochloride and Alizarin Red solution, and were dissected under an operating microscope. The nerve branches of the superior division of the oculomotor nerve innervated the proximal third (type I) in 2 of 30 LPS muscles (6.7%), in 8 of 30 muscles (26.7%) extended to the middle third (type II), and reached the distal third (type III) in 20 of 30 muscles (66.7%). The terminal branches ran through the medial third (type IIIa) in 6 of 20 type III LPS muscles (30%), the central third (type IIIb) in 8 muscles(40%), and the lateral third (type IIIc) in 6 muscles (30%). The oculomotor nerve ends that extend forward to the distal third of the LPS muscle (type III) are exposed and vulnerable to local anesthetics and may be numbed during blepharoplasty. If this is so, postoperative blepharoptosis may be caused by transient paralysis of the LPS muscle, and great care should be taken during the injection of local anesthetics near the LPS.

The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) has a central function in the regulation of blood pressure. Aliskiren, the first direct renin inhibitor to be approved for the treatment of hypertension, blocks the RAAS at its point of activation. As renin inhibition acts at the top of the RAAS cascade, this mechanism has been proposed to offer advantages over existing modes of RAAS blockade. The RAAS is also considered to be a major factor in the pathogenesis of many renal diseases, especially diabetic nephropathy (DN), the main cause of end-stage renal disease. Existing therapies to block the RAAS slow the progression of DN, but they do not halt the disease. Therefore, more effective modes of interventions are needed. Studies to determine the efficacy of aliskiren in human renal disease are in progress. This review summarizes in vivo studies in which the efficacy of aliskiren was tested in experimental models of renal disease, and presents in vitro studies that provide insights into the possible mechanisms by which aliskiren confers renoprotection in animals. These works are discussed in the framework of the intrarenal RAAS and suggest that aliskiren may act by unique renoprotective mechanisms.
Cancer-testis antigens (CTA), such as NY-ESO-1, MAGE-A1, and MAGE-A3, are immunogenic proteins encoded by genes, which are normally expressed only in male germ cells but are activated by ill-defined epigenetic mechanisms in human tumors, including lung cancers. Previously, we reported induction of these CTAs in cancer cells, but not normal cells, by DNA-demethylating agents and histone deacetylase inhibitors using clinically achievable exposure conditions. In the present study, we evaluated chromatin alterations associated with repression/activation of cancer-testis genes in lung cancer cells to further develop gene-induction regimens for cancer immunotherapy. Repression of NY-ESO-1, MAGE-A1, and MAGE-A3 coincided with DNA hypermethylation, recruitment, and binding of polycomb-group proteins, and histone heterochromatin modifications within the promoters of these genes. Derepression coincided with DNA demethylation, dissociation of polycomb proteins, and presence of euchromatin marks within the respective promoters. Short hairpin RNAs were used to inhibit several histone methyltransferases (KMT) and histone demethylases (KDM) that mediate histone methylation and repress gene expression. Knockdown of KMT6, KDM1, or KDM5B markedly enhanced deoxyazacytidine (DAC)-mediated activation of these cancer-testis genes in lung cancer cells. DZNep, a pharmacologic inhibitor of KMT6 expression, recapitulated the effects of KMT6 knockdown. Following DAC-DZNep exposure, lung cancer cells were specifically recognized and lysed by allogeneic lymphocytes expressing recombinant T-cell receptors recognizing NY-ESO-1 and MAGE-A3. Combining DNA-demethylating agents with compounds, such as DZNep, that modulate histone lysine methylation may provide a novel epigenetic strategy to augment cancer-testis gene expression as an adjunct to adoptive cancer immunotherapy.
AIMS: Mirabegron, the first β3 -adrenoceptor agonist to enter clinical practice, has a different mechanism of action from antimuscarinic agents. This review presents data on the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of mirabegron in studies conducted to date.METHODS: All clinical data on mirabegron that are currently in the public domain are included, including some in-press manuscripts.RESULTS: In Phase III clinical trials in patients with overactive bladder (OAB), mirabegron at daily doses of 25, 50, and 100 mg demonstrated significant efficacy in treating the symptoms of OAB, including micturition frequency, urgency incontinence, and urgency. Significant improvements in micturition frequency, urgency incontinence, and mean volume voided/micturition were seen as early as the first assessment (week 4) for mirabegron 50 and 100 mg, and were maintained throughout treatment. Responder analyses showed a significant improvement with mirabegron 50 and 100 mg in terms of dry rates, ≥50% reduction in mean number of incontinence episodes/24 hr, and the proportion of patients with ≤8 micturitions/24 hr at final visit. The benefit of mirabegron 50 and 100 mg was also evident in patients ≥65 years of age, and in both treatment-naïve patients and those who previously discontinued antimuscarinic therapy. These data therefore demonstrate a clinically meaningful benefit with mirabegron in the objective endpoints of OAB. Assessment of measures of health-related quality of life and treatment satisfaction showed that patients perceived treatment with mirabegron as meaningful. In OAB clinical trials of up to 12 months mirabegron appeared to be well tolerated. The most common adverse events (AEs) observed with mirabegron in clinical trials of up to 12 months were hypertension, nasopharyngitis, and urinary tract infection. The incidence of dry mouth was similar to placebo, and was between three and fivefold less than for tolterodine extended release 4 mg. Since dry mouth is the most bothersome AE associated with antimuscarinic drugs and often a reason for treatment discontinuation, mirabegron may be a valuable treatment option for these patients.CONCLUSIONS: In Phase III clinical trials, mirabegron at daily doses of 25, 50, and 100 mg demonstrated significant efficacy in treating symptoms of OAB and, at doses of 50 and 100 mg, demonstrated significant improvements versus placebo on key secondary endpoints, as early as the first assessment (week 4), and these were maintained throughout treatment. In OAB clinical trials of up to 12 months, mirabegron appeared to be well tolerated.
The Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS) are a group of connective tissue disorders characterized by triad of joint hypermobility, skin extensibility, and tissue fragility. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV places patients at risk for life-threatening, spontaneous, vascular or visceral rupture due to reduced or abnormal secretion of type III collagen. We present an adolescent male who was found to have a perisigmoid abscess with a fistula connecting to adjacent sigmoid colon secondary to undiagnosed EDS type IV. Conservative management with antibiotics and bowel rest was pursued to allow for elective resection for his acute complicated diverticulitis at a safer time.
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating lung disease of unknown cause. The clinical course is unpredictable, but the disease is usually progressive with a median survival of 2-5 years as a result of advanced respiratory failure. The current hypothesis of the disease mechanism is recurrent injury to the respiratory epithelium which leads to an uncontrolled wound healing process resulting in fibrosis rather than repair. Despite better understanding of the pathogenesis, there is no effective therapy for the disease. In this review, we present the positive results of recently published clinical trials regarding therapy for IPF, with emphasis on pirfenidone and nintedanib.
Calciphylaxis is a disease in which metastatic calcification affects small- and medium-sized vessels resulting in significant dermatologic manifestations. Lesions typically occur over areas of high fat content and progress to black leathery eschars. Calciphylaxis is associated with intense pain and markedly increased risk of infection, often leading to sepsis requiring hospitalization. Diagnosis is made by clinical history and skin biopsy. Management of calciphylaxis is interdisciplinary, emphasizing factors such as primary prevention, proper wound care, pain control, and hormone and mineral balance. Although calciphylaxis carries a high mortality rate, symptomatic treatment has shown promise as a method for controlling disease progression.
During autophagy, cytosol, protein aggregates, and organelles are sequestered into double-membrane vesicles called autophagosomes and delivered to the lysosome/vacuole for breakdown and recycling of their basic components. In all eukaryotes this pathway is important for adaptation to stress conditions such as nutrient deprivation, as well as to regulate intracellular homeostasis by adjusting organelle number and clearing damaged structures. For a long time, starvation-induced autophagy has been viewed as a nonselective transport pathway; however, recent studies have revealed that autophagy is able to selectively engulf specific structures, ranging from proteins to entire organelles. In this paper, we discuss recent findings on the mechanisms and physiological implications of two selective types of autophagy: ribophagy, the specific degradation of ribosomes, and reticulophagy, the selective elimination of portions of the ER.
The histone H3-H4 chaperone Asf1 is involved in chromatin assembly (or disassembly), histone exchange, regulation of transcription, and chromatin silencing in several organisms. To investigate the essential functions of Asf1 in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, asf1-ts mutants were constructed by random mutagenesis using PCR. One mutant (asf1-33(ts)) was mated with mutants in 77 different kinase genes to identify synthetic lethal combinations. The asf1-33 mutant required the DNA damage checkpoint factors Chk1 and Rad3 for its survival at the restrictive temperature. Chk1, but not Cds1, was phosphorylated in the asf1-33 mutant at the restrictive temperature, indicating that the DNA damage checkpoint was activated in the asf1-33 mutant. DNA damage occured in the asf1-33 mutant, with degradation of the chromosomal DNA observed through pulse-field gel electrophoresis and the formation of Rad22 foci. Sensitivity to micrococcal nuclease in the asf1-33 mutant was increased compared to the asf1(+) strain at the restrictive temperature, suggesting that asf1 mutations also caused a defect in overall chromatin structure. The Asf1-33 mutant protein was mislocalized and incapable of binding histones. Furthermore, histone H3 levels at the centromeric outer repeat region were decreased in the asf1-33 mutant and heterochromatin structure was impaired. Finally, sim3, which encodes a CenH3 histone chaperone, was identified as a strong suppressor of the asf1-33 mutant. Taken together, these results clearly indicate that Asf1 plays an essential role in maintaining genomic stability in S. pombe.
Bax and Bak (Bax/Bak) are essential pro-apoptotic proteins of the Bcl-2 family that trigger mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) in a Bcl-2/Bcl-xL-inhibitable manner. We recently discovered a new stress-related function for Bax/Bak-regulation of nuclear protein redistribution (NPR) from the nucleus to cytoplasm. This effect was independent of Bax/Bak N-terminus exposure and not inhibited by Bcl-xL over-expression. Here, we studied the molecular mechanism governing this novel non-canonical response. Wild-type (WT) and mutant versions of Bax were re-expressed in Bax/Bak double-knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts and their ability to promote NPR, apoptotic events, and changes in lamin A mobility was examined. Our results show that, in this system, Bax expression was sufficient to restore NPR such as in WT cells undergoing apoptosis. This activity of Bax was uncoupled from cytochrome c release from the mitochondria (indicative of MOMP) and required its membrane localization, α helices 5/6, and the Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3) domain. Moreover, enrichment of Bax in the nuclear envelope by the so-called Klarsicht/ANC-1/Syne-1 homology domain effectively triggered NPR as in WT Bax, but without inducing MOMP or cell death. Bax-induced NPR was associated with impairment in lamin A mobility, implying a connection between these two nuclear envelope-associated events. Overall, the results indicate a new MOMP-independent, stress-induced Bax function on the nuclear envelope.
We have identified a region with characteristics of a paternal-specific methylation imprint at the human H19 locus. This region, extending from -2.0 kb upstream to the start of transcription, is heavily methylated in sperm and on the paternal allele in somatic cells. This methylation was preserved during pre-implantation. Structural analysis revealed the presence of CpG islands and a large direct repeat with a 400 bp sequence reiterated several times, but no significant sequence homology to the corresponding region of the mouse H19 gene. These findings could suggest a role for secondary DNA structure in genomic imprinting across the species, and they also present a puzzling aspect of the evolution of the H19 regulatory region in human and mouse.
AIM: The aim of this study is to establish the nature (urgent vs. non-urgent), demographics, presentation and management of Achenbach's syndrome and to formulate an algorithmic approach for their diagnosis and management.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic review and met-aggregation of literature from 1944 to 2015 in English language in MedLine, Embase and Cochrane database were conducted.RESULTS: Achenbach's syndrome is a female-dominant disease with median age of 49.5 years (range 22-76) (age ≤60, n = 11/12, 91 %). It presents with unilateral volar discoloration of a finger (100 %). It is associated with pain (n = 7/12, 58. %), edema (n = 7/12, 58 %), and paresthesia (n = 3/12, 25 %). The median time to resolution of symptoms without any intervention was 4 days (range 2-14).CONCLUSION: AS is self-limiting and a non-urgent surgical condition. It can be differentiated from other pathologies by clinical spectrum, patient demographics and in doubtful circumstances (acute limb ischemia) by Doppler sonography. An algorithmic approach can avoid hospital admissions, partially unnecessary investigation and assist in patient assurance.
Tremor and parkinsonism are recognized side effects of valproate; however, the relationship between rest tremor and other signs of parkinsonism has not been addressed in patients taking valproate. We studied a cohort of 125 consecutive patients treated with valproate due to epilepsy or migraine, evaluated with the Fahn-Tolosa-Marin Tremor Rating Scale (FTM-TRS). A total of 14 (11.2%) patients had rest tremor (bilateral n = 10, unilateral n = 4). Patients with rest tremor had significant higher scores in the FTM-TRS (P < 0.001), but only one was diagnosed with parkinsonism. Patients may have valproate-induced parkinsonism or exacerbated motor features of Parkinson's disease by valproate. The frequency of parkinsonism was 1.6% in this cohort and of 3% in the pooled data of 717 patients from previous reports. Rest tremor is observed in 11.2% of patients treated with valproate and is related to the burden of valproate-induced tremor, rather than the presence of parkinsonism.
The p16-cyclin D-pRB-E2F pathway is frequently deregulated in human tumors. This critical regulatory pathway controls the G1/S transition of the mammalian cell cycle by positive and negative regulation of E2F-responsive genes required for DNA replication. To assess the value of the transcription factors E2Fs as targets for antiproliferative strategies, we have initiated a program aiming to develop inhibitors targeting specifically these proteins in vitro and in vivo. The cellular activity of E2F is the result of the heterodimeric association of two families of proteins, E2Fs and DPs, which then bind DNA. Here, we use a two hybrid approach to isolate from combinatorial libraries peptide aptamers that specifically interact with E2Fs DNA binding and dimerization domains. One of these is a potent inhibitor of E2F binding activity in vitro and in mammalian fibroblasts, blocks cells in G1, and the free variable region from this aptamer has the same effect. Our experiments argue that the variable region of this aptamer is structured, and that it functions by binding E2F with a motif that resembles a DP heterodimerization region, and blocking E2F's association with DP. These results show that cell proliferation can be inhibited using genetically-selected synthetic peptides that specifically target protein-protein interaction motifs within cell cycle regulators. These results also emphasize the critical role of the E2F pathway for cell proliferation and might allow the design of novel antiproliferative agents targeting the cyclin/CDK-pRB-E2F pathway.
DNA replication, as with all macromolecular synthesis steps, is controlled in part at the level of initiation. Although the origin recognition complex (ORC) binds to origins of DNA replication, it does not solely determine their location. To initiate DNA replication ORC requires Cdc6 to target initiation to specific DNA sequences in chromosomes and with Cdt1 loads the ring-shaped mini-chromosome maintenance (MCM) 2-7 DNA helicase component onto DNA. ORC and Cdc6 combine to form a ring-shaped complex that contains six AAA+ subunits. ORC and Cdc6 ATPase mutants are defective in MCM loading, and ORC ATPase mutants have reduced activity in ORC x Cdc6 x DNA complex formation. Here we analyzed the role of the Cdc6 ATPase on ORC x Cdc6 complex stability in the presence or absence of specific DNA sequences. Cdc6 ATPase is activated by ORC, regulates ORC x Cdc6 complex stability, and is suppressed by origin DNA. Mutations in the conserved origin A element, and to a lesser extent mutations in the B1 and B2 elements, induce Cdc6 ATPase activity and prevent stable ORC x Cdc6 formation. By analyzing ORC x Cdc6 complex stability on various DNAs, we demonstrated that specific DNA sequences control the rate of Cdc6 ATPase, which in turn controls the rate of Cdc6 dissociation from the ORC x Cdc6 x DNA complex. We propose a mechanism explaining how Cdc6 ATPase activity promotes origin DNA sequence specificity; on DNA that lacks origin activity, Cdc6 ATPase promotes dissociation of Cdc6, whereas origin DNA down-regulates Cdc6 ATPase resulting in a stable ORC x Cdc6 x DNA complex, which can then promote MCM loading. This model has relevance for origin specificity in higher eukaryotes.
The coincidence of hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count (HELLP) syndrome and cortical blindness is an uncommon but very dramatic event. We describe a case of HELLP syndrome complicating with acute cortical blindness before delivery. A 27 year-old woman, gravida 1, para 0, with normal medical history, was referred to our emergency department at the 33th week of gestation due to headache, vomiting, and blurred vision. The ophthalmologic examination showed intact pupillary light reflexes and normal ophthalmoscopic findings, but no light perception in either eye. Brain computed tomography showed normal findings. HELLP syndrome and preeclampsia was diagnosed based on the findings of hypertension and proteinuria as well as laboratory data. Prompt delivery was performed in order to achieve good maternal and neonatal outcomes.
OBJECTIVE: 1) To assess the prevalence of stress urinary incontinence (SUI) and urge urinary incontinence (UTI) in elite women athletes versus the general female population, and 2) to analyze the conditions of occurrence of urine loss in search of etiological clues in elite athletes. DECISION: An anonymous self-questionnaire was collected transversally from women aged 18 to 35 years. The exposed group was composed of elite female athletes; the non-exposed group was made up of women in the same age range accepting to answer the questionnaire.RESULTS: A total of 157 answers from elite athletes and 426 from control subjects were available for analysis. Urinary incontinence prevalence was 28% for athletes and 9.8% for control subjects (p = .001). There was no significant difference in the relative prevalence of SUI between the athletes and control subjects. Athletes reported urine loss more frequently during the second part of the training session (p < 0.0003), and the second part of competition (p < 0.05). Urinary incontinence prevalence was 9.87% in physically-active control subjects versus 9.84% in sedentary control subjects (NS). Even a small quantity of urine loss was felt to be embarrassing. Most incontinent women did not dare to speak of their condition to anybody.CONCLUSIONS: There is a very high prevalence of urinary incontinence in women athletes. Detailed studies of the patho-physiology of this problem are necessary to formulate preventive recommendations.
We present a case of frontal sinusitis complicated with a subdural empyema, in which the identified microorganism was Gemella morbillorum, a frequent host of the aerodigestive tract and occasionally related to infections. The problem was resolved successfully using endoscopic surgery and an external approach of the sinus. Afterwards it was completed with a subdural drainage through craniotomy. Subdural empyema is a rare complication of sinusitis although very severe. We want to emphasize the importance of early diagnosis of intracranial complications, the need of a detailed microbiology test the method used to obtain samples, and the convenience of a combined approach by the otolaryngologists and the neurosurgeons for its complete drainage.
The McKusick-Dungy-Kaufman syndrome is characterized by hydrometrocolpos, polydactyly and congenital heart disease. Two of these 3 main symptoms should be present for the diagnosis. Associated anomalies are mainly found in the urogenital tract, the gastro-intestinal tract and the skeletal system. On the basis of 2 patients and the literature the clinical features and the genetic aspects of this syndrome are reviewed. The clinical variability and the severity of the syndrome are stressed. Evidence for an autosomal recessive inheritance is given. Because of the clinical variability it seems preferable to use the term complex rather than syndrome.
Cardiovascular diseases are still the most important cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide and anti-thrombotic treatment is widely used as a result. The currently used drugs include heparin and its derivatives, vitamin K antagonists, though efficacious, have their own set of limitations like unpredictable pharmacokinetic profile, parenteral route (with heparin and its derivatives only), narrow therapeutic window, and constant laboratory monitoring for their efficacy and safety. This lead to the development of novel factor Xa inhibitors which could be given orally, have predictable dose response relationship and are associated with lesser hemorrhagic complications. They include rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban among others. Apixaban has currently been approved for use in patients undergoing total knee or hip replacement surgery and to prevent stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. Many trials are ongoing for apixaban to firmly establish its place in future, among the anti-thrombotic drugs.
BACKGROUND: Bazex syndrome (acrokeratosis paraneoplastica) is a rare paraneoplastic syndrome that usually occurs in males over 40 years old and is particularly associated with squamous cell carcinoma of the upper aerodigestive tract and adenopathy above the diaphragm.OBJECTIVE: The objectives of our article are (1) to describe a unique case of acrokeratosis paraneoplastica and (2) to review the current literature regarding skin findings, commonly associated neoplasms, and treatment options relative to this condition.PATIENT: We describe a 68-year-old female with lobular breast carcinoma, complicated by local and distant recurrences, who presented with a 1-year history of prominent acral skin and nail changes.RESULTS: Our patient's clinical skin findings improved significantly following treatment and partial remission of her underlying malignancy.CONCLUSIONS: Our patient represents one of few females described with this syndrome, which is especially rare in association with lobular breast carcinoma. Further, the patient's presentation is unique as she was discovered to demonstrate laboratory findings consistent with coexistent porphyria cutanea tarda and relative zinc deficiency.
AIMS: Ca(2+) waves are thought to be important in the aetiology of ventricular tachyarrhythmias. There have been conflicting results regarding whether flecainide reduces Ca(2+) waves in isolated cardiomyocytes. We sought to confirm whether flecainide inhibits waves in the intact cardiomyocyte and to elucidate the mechanism.METHODS AND RESULTS: We imaged spontaneous sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+) release events in healthy adult rat cardiomyocytes. Variation in stimulation frequency was used to produce Ca(2+) sparks or waves. Spark frequency, wave frequency, and wave velocity were reduced by flecainide in the absence of a reduction of SR Ca(2+) content. Inhibition of I(Na) via alternative pharmacological agents (tetrodotoxin, propafenone, or lidocaine) produced similar changes. To assess the contribution of I(Na) to spark and wave production, voltage clamping was used to activate contraction from holding potentials of -80 or -40 mV. This confirmed that reducing Na(+) influx during myocyte stimulation is sufficient to reduce waves and that flecainide only causes Ca(2+) wave reduction when I(Na) is active. It was found that Na(+)/Ca(2+)-exchanger (NCX)-mediated Ca(2+) efflux was significantly enhanced by flecainide and that the effects of flecainide on wave frequency could be reversed by reducing [Na(+)](o), suggesting an important downstream role for NCX function.CONCLUSION: Flecainide reduces spark and wave frequency in the intact rat cardiomyocyte at therapeutically relevant concentrations but the mechanism involves I(Na) reduction rather than direct ryanodine receptor (RyR2) inhibition. Reduced I(Na) results in increased Ca(2+) efflux via NCX across the sarcolemma, reducing Ca(2+) concentration in the vicinity of the RyR2.
Fusobacterium necrophorum is a rare infection most notable for causing Lemierre's syndrome. This consists of a primary oropharyngeal infection and septic thrombophlebitis, and one or more metastatic focus. Prior to the widespread use of antibiotics, Lemierre's syndrome commonly followed a rapidly progressing course, with a high mortality. We describe a case of a previously well 18-month-old boy who presented to the emergency department with a 3-week history of progressive, right-sided, painful neck swelling and systemic sepsis. He was initially treated conservatively with intravenous antibiotics, but ultimately required surgical drainage. Lemierre's syndrome is a rare condition with increasing incidence which can have significant adverse outcomes including death. Early recognition and treatment are essential, but identifying Lemierre's disease is challenging.
Adequate bioavailability is one of the essential properties for an orally administered drug. Lipinski and others have formulated simplified rules in which compounds that satisfy selected physiochemical properties, for example, molecular weight (MW) ≤ 500 or the logarithm of the octanol-water partition coefficient, log P(o/w) < 5, are anticipated to likely have pharmacokinetic properties appropriate for oral administration. However, these schemes do not simultaneously consider the combination of the physiochemical properties, complicating their application in a more automated fashion. To overcome this, we present a novel method to select compounds with a combination of physicochemical properties that maximize bioavailability and druglikeness based on compounds in the World Drug Index database. In the study four properties, MW, log P(o/w), number of hydrogen bond donors, and number of hydrogen acceptors, were combined into a 4-dimensional (4D) histogram, from which a scoring function was defined on the basis of a 4D dependent multivariate Gaussian model. The resulting equation allows for assigning compounds a bioavailability score, termed 4D-BA, such that chemicals with higher 4D-BA scores are more likely to have oral druglike characteristics. The descriptor is validated by applying the function to drugs previously categorized in the Biopharmaceutics Classification System, and examples of application of the descriptor are given in the context of previously published studies targeting heme oxygenase and SHP2 phosphatase. The approach is anticipated to be useful in early lead identification studies in combination with clustering methods to maximize chemical and structural diversity when selecting compounds for biological assays from large database screens. It may also be applied to prioritize synthetically feasible chemical modifications during lead compound optimization.

SUMMARY: Here we introduce Lipid Mini-On, an open-source tool that performs lipid enrichment analyses and visualizations of lipidomics data. Lipid Mini-On uses a text-mining process to bin individual lipid names into multiple lipid ontology groups based on the classification (e.g. LipidMaps) and other characteristics, such as chain length. Lipid Mini-On provides users with the capability to conduct enrichment analysis of the lipid ontology terms using a Shiny app with options of five statistical approaches. Lipid classes can be added to customize the user's database and remain updated as new lipid classes are discovered. Visualization of results is available for all classification options (e.g. lipid subclass and individual fatty acid chains). Results are also visualized through an editable network of relationships between the individual lipids and their associated lipid ontology terms. The utility of the tool is demonstrated using biological (e.g. human lung endothelial cells) and environmental (e.g. peat soil) samples.AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Rodin (R package: https://github.com/PNNL-Comp-Mass-Spec/Rodin), Lipid Mini-On Shiny app (https://github.com/PNNL-Comp-Mass-Spec/LipidMiniOn) and Lipid Mini-On online tool (https://omicstools.pnnl.gov/shiny/lipid-mini-on/).SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
A decade after our discovery of the involvement of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) in cholesterol metabolism through the identification of the first mutations leading to hypercholesterolemia, PCSK9 has become one of the most promising targets in cholesterol and cardiovascular diseases. This challenging work in the genetics of hypercholesterolemia paved the way for a plethora of studies around the world allowing the characterization of PCSK9, its expression, its impact on reducing the abundance of LDL receptor, and the identification of loss-of-function mutations in hypocholesterolemia. We highlight the different steps of this adventure and review the published clinical trials especially those with the anti-PCSK9 antibodies evolocumab (AMG 145) and alirocumab (SAR236553/REGN727), which are in phase III trials. The promising results in lowering LDL cholesterol levels raise hope that the PCSK9 adventure will lead, after the large and long-term ongoing phase III studies evaluating efficacy and safety, to a new anticholesterol pharmacological class.
Posttranslational modification of histones is known to regulate chromatin structure and transcriptional activity, and the nuclear lamina is thought to serve as a site for heterochromatin maintenance and transcriptional silencing. In this report, we show that the nuclear lamina can also play a role in the downregulation of heterochromatin and in gene activation. Herpes simplex virus DNA initiates replication in replication compartments near the inner edge of the nucleus, and histones are excluded from these structures. To define the role of nuclear lamins in HSV replication, we examined HSV infection in wild-type and A-type lamin-deficient (Lmna-/-) murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). In Lmna-/- cells, viral replication compartments are reduced in size and fail to target to the nuclear periphery, as observed in WT cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence studies demonstrate that HSV DNA is associated with increased heterochromatin in Lmna-/- MEFs. These results argue for a functional role for A-type lamins as viral gene expression, DNA replication, and growth are reduced in Lmna-/- MEFs, with the greatest effect on viral replication at low multiplicity of infection. Thus, lamin A/C is required for targeting of the viral genome and the reduction of heterochromatin on viral promoters during lytic infection. The nuclear lamina can serve as a molecular scaffold for DNA genomes and the protein complexes that regulate both euchromatin and heterochromatin histone modifications.
Intracranial germinomas are considered one of the most radiosensitive tumors and are curable by radiotherapy alone. Although patients can expect long-term survival, the adverse effects of radiotherapy and late sequelae in survivors are a major concern. Radiation-induced secondary neoplasms are one of those sequelae and are a serious concern because they are often connected directly with life prognosis. We describe a case of radiation-induced glioblastoma after radiotherapy for germinoma. An 11-year-old boy with basal ganglia germinoma was successfully treated with postoperative cranial irradiation. At the age of 40 years, he was admitted to our hospital for aphasia and memory disturbance. CT and MRI revealed a tumor in the left parietal lobe with dissemination. The tumor of the parietal lobe was removed surgically, and pathohistologically, it was diagnosed as glioblastoma. Long-term survivors who receive radiotherapy for germinomas in childhood are at risk for late complications, including radiation-induced neoplasms. Therefore, careful follow-up neurological examinations are recommended in these patients, even 20-30 years after radiotherapy.
The clinical and laboratory features of COVID-19 are reviewed with attention to the immunologic manifestations of the disease. Recent COVID-19 publications describe a variety of clinical presentations including an asymptomatic state, pneumonia, a hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis like syndrome, Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) but, also called Pediatric Inflammatory Multisystem Syndrome-Toxic Shock (PIMS-TS), Kawasaki Disease, and myocarditis. A common theme amongst multiple reports suggests an overexuberant autoimmune component of the disease but a common pathophysiology to explain the variations in clinical presentation has been elusive. Review of the basic science of other viral induced autoimmune disorders may give clues as to why immunosuppressive and immunomodulating regimens now appear to have some efficacy in COVID-19. Review of the immunopathology also reveals other therapies that have yet to be explored. There is potential use of T cell depleting therapies and possibly anti-CD20 therapy for COVID-19 and clinical research using these medications is warranted.
Gamma-ray irradiation introduces single and/or double strand breaks into the DNA molecule of the cells. In the case of mammalian cells, these breaks are being repaired in general during the first hr following exposure to ionizing radiation. The article reports on the results obtained from testing the ability of cultured lymphocytes from patients with Down's syndrome to repair radiation-induced DNA single-strand breaks. The ability to repair was deduced from the study of the DNA sedimentation profiles in alkaline sucrose gradients. It was found that lymphocytes from Down's syndrome patients are less efficient in repairing single-strand DNA breaks than are lymphocytes from normal individuals. This significantly increased fraction of unrepaired DNA strand breaks might be associated with the unusually high level of radiation-induced chromosome aberrations as compared with normals.
OBJECTIVE: Isotretinoin (13-cis-retinoic acid), approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of acne, carries a black box warning related to the risk of depression, suicide, and psychosis. Retinoic acid, the active form of vitamin A, regulates gene expression in the brain, and isotretinoin is its 13-cis isomer. Retinoids represent a group of compounds derived from vitamin A that perform a large variety of functions in many systems, in particular the central nervous system, and abnormal retinoid levels can have neurologic effects. Although infrequent, proper recognition and treatment of psychiatric side effects in acne patients is critical given the risk of death and disability. This article reviews the evidence for isotretinoin's relationships with depression and suicidality.DATA SOURCES: The PsycINFO, MEDLINE, and PubMed searchable database indexes were searched for articles published in the English language from 1960 to June 2010 using the key words isotretinoin, retinoids, retinoic acid, depression, depressive disorders, and vitamin A. Evidence examined includes (1) case reports; (2) temporal association between onset of depression and exposure to the drug; (3) challenge-rechallenge cases; (4) class effect (other compounds in the same class, like vitamin A, having similar neuropsychiatric effects); (5) dose response; and (6) biologically plausible mechanisms.STUDY SELECTION: All articles in the literature related to isotretinoin, depression, and suicide were reviewed, as well as articles related to class effect, dose response, and biologic plausibility.DATA EXTRACTION: Information from individual articles in the literature was extracted, including number of episodes of depression, suicidality, suicide, psychosis, violence and aggression, past psychiatric history, time of onset in relation to isotretinoin usage, medication dosage, duration of treatment, and dechallenge and challenge history.RESULTS: The literature reviewed is consistent with associations of isotretinoin administration with depression and with suicide in a subgroup of vulnerable individuals.CONCLUSIONS: The relationship between isotretinoin and depression may have implications for a greater understanding of the neurobiology of affective disorders.
IMPORTANCE: The development of programmed cell death 1 (PD-1)/PD-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) checkpoint inhibitors has changed the landscape of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) therapy, with 2 approvals from the US Food and Drug Administration of PD-1 inhibitors for second-line therapy. However, the rational use of these agents has been limited by the lack of a definitive predictive biomarker.OBSERVATIONS: Tumor PD-L1 expression is associated with an increased likelihood of NSCLC response to these agents, although responses can still occur at a low rate in PD-L1-negative tumors. The use of PD-L1 as a predictive biomarker for use of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors is limited by the multitude of PD-L1 antibodies, assays, scoring systems, and thresholds for positivity currently used. Alternative biomarkers such as tumor neoantigens identified through whole-exome sequencing and clinical parameters (eg, smoking or oncogene driver status) may also have predictive value. Biomarkers that can direct the rational use of PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors are crucial given the risk of life-threatening immune-related complications associated with these therapies and the reality that most patients still do not benefit from their use.CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The refinement of existing biomarkers and identification of novel predictive biomarkers will be key to ensuring the effective and safe use of these agents. Since most patients still do not benefit from these agents, it is critical to continue to work to define the select patient population who will derive durable benefit from PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition and identify markers that could have predictive value for combination therapies that could expand the population who benefit.
BACKGROUND: Cellular adhesion molecules play an important role in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis, making selective blockade of these molecules a promising therapeutic strategy. Vedolizumab, a recombinant humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody, inhibits adhesion and migration of leukocytes into the gastrointestinal tract by binding the alpha4beta7 integrin. Animal studies have suggested that vedolizumab may be a useful therapy for ulcerative colitis. This updated systematic review summarizes the current evidence on the use of vedolizumab for induction and maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis.OBJECTIVES: The primary objectives were to determine the efficacy and safety of vedolizumab used for induction and maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis.SEARCH METHODS: A computer-assisted search for relevant studies (inception to 15 June 2014) was performed using PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE and CENTRAL. References from published articles and conference proceedings were searched to identify additional citations.SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials comparing vedolizumab to placebo or a control therapy for induction or maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis were included.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias for each trial. The primary outcomes were failure to induce clinical remission and relapse. Secondary outcomes included failure to induce a clinical response, failure to induce endoscopic remission, failure to induce an endoscopic response, quality of life, adverse events, serious adverse events and withdrawal due to adverse events. We calculated the relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for each outcome. Data were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis. The overall quality of the evidence supporting the outcomes was evaluated using the GRADE criteria.MAIN RESULTS: Four studies (606 patients) were included. All of the studies were rated as having a low risk of bias. Pooled analyses revealed that vedolizumab was significantly superior to placebo for induction of remission, clinical response, and endoscopic remission and prevention of relapse. After 4 to 6 weeks of therapy 77% (293/382) of vedolizumab patients failed to enter clinical remission compared to 92% (205/224) of placebo patients (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.91; 4 studies 606 patients). After 6 weeks of therapy 48% of vedolizumab patients failed to have a clinical response compared to 72% of placebo patients (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.78; 3 studies 601 patients). After 4 to 6 weeks of therapy 68% of vedolizumab patients failed to enter endoscopic remission compared to 81% of placebo patients (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.91; 3 studies, b583 patients). After 52 weeks of therapy, 54% of vedolizumab patients had a clinical relapse compared to 84% of placebo patients (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.77; 1 study, 373 patients). One small study (28 patients) found no statistically significant difference in endoscopic response (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.61). GRADE analyses indicated that the overall quality of the evidence for the primary outcomes was high for induction of remission and moderate for relapse (due to sparse data 246 events). There was no statistically significant difference between vedolizumab and placebo in terms of the risk of any adverse event (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.07), or serious adverse events (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.42). There was a statistically significant difference in withdrawals due to adverse events. Six per cent of vedolizumab patients withdrew due to an adverse event compared to 11% of placebo patients (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.87; 2 studies, 941 patients). Adverse events commonly reported across the studies included: worsening ulcerative colitis, headache, nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, nausea, and abdominal pain.AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Moderate to high quality data from four studies shows that vedolizumab is superior to placebo for induction of clinical remission and response and endoscopic remission in patients with moderate to severely active ulcerative colitis and prevention of relapse in patients with quiescent ulcerative colitis. Moderate quality data from one study suggests that vedolizumab is superior to placebo for prevention of relapse in patients with quiescent ulcerative colitis. Adverse events appear to be similar to placebo. Future trials are needed to define the optimal dose, frequency of administration and long-term efficacy and safety of vedolizumab used for induction and maintenance therapy of ulcerative colitis. Vedolizumab should be compared to other currently approved therapies for ulcerative colitis in these trials.
The increasing appreciation of the importance of autophagy as consequence of cancer therapy or underlying disease biology is illustrated by the large number of papers that are evaluating autophagy as a cancer target. While autophagy is often linked to the generation of metabolic precursors, it is also important in diseases where protein production is a hallmark of the disease itself, such as pancreatic cancer and multiple myeloma. Multiple myeloma is characterized by ongoing autophagy as a consequence of constitutive immunoglobulin production, which creates the need for efficient transfer and disposal of misfolded or unfolded proteins. In order to survive this cellular stress, plasma cells depend on proteasomal degradation of the large volume of misfolded proteins as well as the autophagy pathway. It has previously been suggested that the excess proteins not targeted to the proteasome, or that accumulate when the proteasome is inhibited through the use of chemically active agents such as bortezomib, are linked to impaired cell survival, and that their packaging in the form of an aggresome somehow minimizes their 'proteotoxicity' allowing these toxic proteins to be sequestered away from normal cellular machinery.
BACKGROUND: The decision making process for patients with Sylvian fissure arachnoid cysts still represents a challenge for the neurosurgeon. A high percentage of patients are indeed asymptomatic, despite neuroimaging signs of apparently increased intracranial pressure (ICP). The present study was conducted to evaluate the usefulness of prolonged ICP recording in the preoperative work-up.METHODS: Eleven children (10 M/1 F) harboring temporal arachnoid cysts were investigated (mean age: 5.9 years). According to Galassi classification they were subdivided in three groups. Group I was made up of three patients with Type I cysts; Group II comprised six children with Type II cysts; Group III consisted of two children with Type III cysts. An extensible silicone microprocessor (Codman), developed for continuous ICP recording, was implanted intraparenchymally, adjacent to the major extension of the cyst. The collected information was cable unloaded to a PC and stored. All the patients underwent a minimum of 48 hours to a maximum of 72 hours of ICP continuous check. In resting conditions, 10 mm Hg was arbitrarily chosen as the upper normal limit of ICP, and the patients were classified according to the percentile distribution of their ICP daily and nightly pressure values.RESULTS: ICP recordings were in the normal range in all the three children with Type I cysts (49-86%< 10 mm Hg during the entire recording), despite the fact that two of them were apparently symptomatic. Three of the six children with a Type II temporal cyst had elevated ICP values (69-99%> 10 mm Hg), even though they had an incidental (1 case) or prenatal (2 cases) diagnosis. The remaining three patients had normal ICP values for more than 70% of the recording time period. The two patients with type III temporal arachnoid cysts had almost constantly abnormal ICP values (95-99%> 10 mm Hg). Five patients were operated; in four of them the surgical indication was based on ICP recordings (two of the three children with a Type II cyst and increased ICP and the two patients with a Type III cyst). The last child, harboring a Type I cyst, was operated upon parents' request, as a preventive measure. At a mean follow-up of 9.3 months all the patients operated on are in excellent clinical condition; one of them (Type II cyst) initially undergoing a craniotomy and cystic membrane excision required a subduro-peritoneal shunt implant 3 months after surgery for a symptomatic subdural hygroma on the side of the cyst. Postoperative computed tomography showed signs of brain expansion in the two patients operated on for a Type III cyst, and in the patient operated on for a Type I cyst.CONCLUSIONS: With the limit of the relatively small series presented here, prolonged ICP recording appeared to be an important preoperative tool to rule out the necessity of operating on children with Type I cysts. Furthermore, the study confirmed that an increase of the ICP is almost constantly present in children with Type III cysts. In cases of Type II lesions, the study results were less discriminating, though the ICP monitoring contributed in identifying those patients in whom surgery was indicated despite the absence of symptoms.
Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder caused by inactivating mutations in either the TSC1 or TSC2 genes. It is characterized by the development of multiple, benign tumors in several organs throughout the body. Lesions occur in the brain, kidneys, heart, liver, lungs, and skin and result in seizures and epilepsy, mental retardation, autism, and renal and pulmonary organ system dysfunction, as well as other complications. Elucidation of the molecular pathways and etiological factors responsible for causing TSC has led to a paradigm shift in the management and treatment of the disease. TSC1 or TSC2 mutations lead to constitutive upregulation of the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway, which affects many cellular processes involved in tumor growth. By targeting mammalian target of rapamycin with everolimus, an orally active rapamycin derivative, clinically meaningful and statistically significant reductions in tumor burden have been achieved for the main brain (subependymal giant cell astrocytoma) and renal manifestations (angiomyolipoma) associated with TSC. This review provides an overview of TSC, everolimus, and the clinical trials that led to its approval for the treatment of TSC-associated subependymal giant cell astrocytoma and renal angiomyolipoma.
Observational studies have found that persons who consume large amounts of fruit and vegetables have lower rates of coronary heart disease. The strength of epidemiologic evidence, however, differs for each of the antioxidant vitamins. High intake of vitamin E from food or supplements has generally been associated with a lower incidence of coronary heart disease. The evidence for beta-carotene intake is inconsistent, with several studies finding a modest reduction in risk among persons with high intake, and others failing to find an association. Although many studies have examined the relationship between vitamin C intake and cardiovascular disease, no significant benefit was seen in any of the large studies that were able to control for other antioxidant intake or multivitamin use. Observational studies cannot discern whether the decreased risk observed is caused by the antioxidants themselves or other characteristics of the individuals who consume them. The epidemiologic associations may be due to other nutrients in antioxidant-rich foods, or other dietary or lifestyle factors. Randomized controlled trials are necessary to confirm or refute the observational data. On the basis of available evidence, we should recommend a healthy diet, rich in fruit and vegetables, but should not endorse vitamin supplementation unless conclusive evidence of benefit is demonstrated in clinical trials.
Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS) is a rare multiorgan disease entity with autosomal recessive inheritance characterized by oculocutaneous albinism, bleeding tendency, recurrent bacterial infections and various neurological symptoms. Intracellular vesicle formation is deficient, resulting in giant granules in many cells, e.g. giant melanosomes in the melanocytes. Diagnosis has been based on morphological examination of peripheral blood and bone marrow, with giant granules seen in cells of the myeloid lineage and in lymphocytes. The ultimate diagnostic test is to look for a mutated LYST gene. Most patients develop an accelerated phase of the disease with deposition of lymphohistiocytes in the liver, spleen, lymph nodes and bone marrow, resulting in hepatosplenomegaly, bone marrow infiltration and haemophagocytosis. Peripheral blood neutropenia becomes more profound as anaemia and thrombocytopenia develop. Most patients succumb before the age of 10 years. Four patients with CHS are described, one of whom is a long-term survivor after successful allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, two succumbed during the accelerated phase and one is living with a chronic form of the disease.CONCLUSION: Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation from an HLA-matched sibling is the therapy of choice and should be performed early. If there is no matched family donor, an unrelated donor or a placental blood graft is a good alternative. The clinical picture of CHS is heterogeneous and therapeutic decisions need to be made on an individual basis.
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) provokes secondary pathological mechanisms, including ischemic and inflammatory processes. The new research in sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulators has opened the door for an effective mechanism of reducing central nervous system (CNS) inflammatory lesion activity. Thus, the aim of this study was to characterize the immunomodulatory effect of the functional S1PR1 antagonist, siponimod, in phase III clinical trials for autoimmune disorders and of the competitive sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor subtype 1 (S1PR1) antagonist, TASP0277308, in pre-clinical development in an in vivo model of TBI in mice. We used the well-characterized model of TBI caused by controlled cortical impact. Mice were injected intraperitoneally with siponimod or TASP0277308 (1 mg/kg) at 1 and 4 h post-trauma. Our results demonstrated that these agents exerted significant beneficial effects on TBI pre-clinical scores in term of anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects, in particular, attenuation of astrocytes and microglia activation, cytokines release, and rescue of the reduction of adhesion molecules (i.e., occludin and zonula occludens-1). Moreover, these compounds were able to decrease T-cell activation visible by reduction of CD4+ and CD8+, reduce the lesioned area (measured by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining), and to preserve tissue architecture, microtubule stability, and neural plasticity. Moreover, our findings provide pre-clinical evidence for the use of low-dose oral S1PR1 antagonists as neuroprotective strategies for TBI and broaden our understanding of the underlying S1PR1-driven neuroinflammatory processes in the pathophysiology of TBI. Altogether, our results showed that blocking the S1PR1 axis is an effective therapeutic strategy to mitigate neuropathological effects engaged in the CNS by TBI.
