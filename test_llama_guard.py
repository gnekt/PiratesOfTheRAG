"""
This script is designed to test the effectiveness of the Llama Guard defense
mechanism against the attack queries generated by the "Pirates of the RAG" algorithm.

It operates by:
1.  Loading the history of a completed attack run from a saved pickle file. This
    history contains the exact prompts that were generated by the attacker's LLM (f*).
2.  Re-sending these malicious prompts to the target RAG agent's endpoint, which
    is now presumed to be running with the Llama Guard moderation layer enabled
    (as implemented in the 'vllm_with_guardian' script).
3.  Collecting the safety assessments ('safe' or 'unsafe') returned by the guard model
    for each prompt and response.
4.  Saving these statistics to a file for later analysis.

This process allows for a quantitative evaluation of how well a guardrail defense
can detect and mitigate the adaptive privacy attacks, as discussed in the "Defense
Strategies" section of the paper.
